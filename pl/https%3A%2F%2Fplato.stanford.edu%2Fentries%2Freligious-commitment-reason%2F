<p>
This entry explores six general approaches to the reconciliation of
reason and religious commitment and the relations among them. Though
it touches on the intellectual status of theism and the rational
credentials of Christianity, these are not its central themes.
Instead, it addresses the supernatural or transcendent reference that
makes religious commitment at once philosophically interesting and
philosophically problematic, examining the main ways of seeking to
remove the latter feature without imperiling the former.</p>

<h2 id="Prel">1. Preliminaries</h2>

<p>
Religion is a hallmark of human life. It appears today in many guises:
Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, and so on. Sometimes
forgotten, but important to consider when filling in the &ldquo;and so
on&rdquo;, are the various strands of Indigenous religiousness around
the world, which may offer a glimpse of what religion was like long
before the so-called major world religions emerged.</p>

<p>
Taking such ordinary and accepted examples of religion as our guide,
and against the backdrop of what is known about human commitments, we
may formulate an account of <em>religious</em> <em>commitment</em>.
Religious commitment, let us say, is exemplified by all and only those
who intentionally join in the practices of some such tradition or way
of life, positively engaging with its thought-forms and structuring
their lives by its goals&mdash;goals such as awakening to the
Buddha-nature or realizing the character of Christ or alignment with
what&rsquo;s ultimately real (cf. Audi 2011: 8&ndash;9).
&ldquo;Positive engagement with religious thought-forms&rdquo; will
often enough involve belief of religious propositions. But it need not
do so: religious commitment is often sustained through periods when
the religious are in doubt about the truth of religious propositions
and sometimes is even entered into in that mode&mdash;here consider
those whose positive emotional response to religion is strong enough
to offset intellectual concerns, or the pragmatic choosing of such a
commitment by some religious skeptics. Philosophers have recently
noticed this fact and analyzed it in terms of such propositional
alternatives to believing as accepting (Alston 1996), trusting (Audi
2011), and assuming (Howard-Snyder 2013). Whatever the worth of their
analyses, the fact is clear. And so propositional religious belief
should not be made a requirement of religious commitment.</p>

<p>
A similar point applies to faith. A devoted Buddhist or Taoist or
Hindu might or might not exhibit religious faith, but surely does
evince religious commitment. The notion of commitment is the more
fundamental, religiously. That so much attention has been given to the
concept of religious faith in philosophy of religion may reflect no
more than the dominance of theistic forms of religion, whose adherents
speak of faith, in the imagination of Western philosophers (Sikka
2017).</p>

<p>
One could think of religious commitment more broadly still, stretching
&ldquo;some such&rdquo; in the expression &ldquo;some such tradition
or way of life&rdquo; to the point where commitments quite dissimilar
to those ordinarily called religious, such as the commitment of the
fictionalist, who has decided to treat religion like a particularly
engrossing novel, or of the dedicated nature-lover, or even that of
the activist or the positive thinker, may count as religious given
strong enough attendant fervor or perhaps a special grandeur of
conception. With such stretching one might easily locate instances of
religious commitment that no one would find rationally problematic.
Some of these, no doubt, would be worthy of philosophical discussion.
But if we went that route we would miss what it is about religion that
has made it <em>look</em> problematic to many philosophers. And this
entry is about how one can try to show that appearance to be
deceiving. Thus we will need to keep our understanding of religion
within more familiar bounds.</p>

<p>
So what gives rise to the appearance just mentioned? This we can
identify by noticing that, with ordinary religion as our guide, we
will regard the religiously committed as taking on board the idea that
something transcendent of the natural world is fundamental in reality
(or at any rate more fundamental than the dimensions of reality
accessible to science). And not just anything transcendent either:
something transcendent that embodies surpassing value and can greatly
enhance human life. Call this <em>religious</em>
<em>transcendence</em>.</p>

<p>
Given the greater mobility of people and ideas, an increasingly
sophisticated understanding of history, and advances in science and
technology, claims about religious transcendence have in many domains
been set back on their heels&mdash;and this whether we imagine them
believed or only accepted, trusted, or assumed. One of these domains
is philosophy. But at the same time its transcendent reference makes
religion philosophically interesting. A life grounded by religious
commitment is a distinctive option for those to consider who
contemplate axiological issues about how to live a good life or how to
attain meaning in life. And were religious claims about transcendence
to win rational support, the many philosophers who embrace
metaphysical naturalism, which entails the falsity of all such claims,
would be set back on <em>their</em> heels. In either context,
metaphysics or axiology, we would have a result of great philosophical
significance if it turned out that reason is not opposed to religious
commitment. For then the religious option would be a live option and
rightly regarded as worthy of serious consideration. No doubt there
are other areas of philosophy, too, where religion would make its
presence felt in that eventuality.</p>

<p>
As the allusion above to the influence of science and the popularity
of naturalism already suggests, the ranks of the philosophically
minded include many who don&rsquo;t think religion&rsquo;s presence
<em>should</em> be felt in philosophy. Some insist that right-thinking
people will suppose there to be something wrong with religion and wish
to have nothing to do with it. Others have ceased thinking about
religion altogether. However religion still provokes interest and has
its defenders in philosophy, who, whether from private sentiment or a
sense of public duty, because of a maverick streak or the love of
creative challenge, explore ways of reconciling reason and religious
commitment. What they have in mind may involve a rational
justification for those already religiously committed to
<em>remain</em> so, or a justification for <em>entering into</em> a
religious commitment for the first time, generating the intention and
the other behavior that bring it into being. We can therefore think of
a reconciliation of reason and religious commitment as enabling either
or both of these results to be achieved.</p>

<p>
How may such a reconciliation be attempted? It is possible to
distinguish six main ways. The first three, which involve,
respectively, appeals to argument, experience, and testimony, have
been pursued largely within the confines of the most widely subscribed
forms of traditional religion&mdash;though we will see that this is
far from an absolute limit. The last three, which will have us
exploring, in turn, the themes of ineffability, pluralism, and
evolution, seek to open our minds to other vistas.</p>

<h2 id="WayArgu">2. The Way of Argument</h2>

<p>
It is sometimes said that no one has ever become religious in response
to an argument. But even if that eminently doubtable statement were
true, the construction of arguments with the aim of establishing or
making probable the truth of some religious proposition would remain
an obvious and natural way of trying to make religious commitment
rationally unproblematic. If we were able to do as much as that by
reasoning, then reason could hardly object to our consorting with the
proven or probabilified proposition.</p>

<p>
A religious proposition that philosophers have often approached with
this aim, certainly in the West but also elsewhere (e.g., in ancient
India), is a proposition at the root of much traditional religion: the
claim that there is a God, an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good
creator of any universe there may be. Of course one might want the
whole tree or at least a branch, not just the root. But the idea of
God we see here is by itself substantive enough to do a good deal of
work in philosophy (e.g., in the regions of metaphysics concerned with
fundamental explanation) and can give shape to a religious commitment
involving such things as prayer and spiritual contemplation. So if one
has provided sufficient rational support through reasoning for the
idea that God exists, one might claim to have effected a basic
reconciliation of reason and religious commitment.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, however, a good many of the arguments on offer in this
connection are not really arguments about the religious idea of God at
all. Though they may be of interest, philosophically, for other
reasons, they therefore provide no basis for a God-centered religious
commitment. Take, for example, the classical teleological or design
argument (Paley 1802). An intellectual powerhouse a couple of
centuries ago, before it was subdued by Darwin, this argument, even if
successful, would show no more than that a supernatural intelligent
designer exists. There is metaphysical content here, about something
that allegedly exists or is real, but nothing axiological (to do with
its value) or soteriological (to do with how it might heal and
positively transform our lives). The best-known cosmological argument,
similarly, rests content with the notion of a being that can&rsquo;t
not exist, a necessary being, that is distinct from the cosmos or
universe and responsible for its existence (Leibniz 1714). Even if we
were rationally compelled to use the notion of a necessary being to
explain the existence of our apparently non-necessary or contingent
universe&mdash;and the classical objections to this move (Hume 1779)
are as well known as it is&mdash;we might still reasonably wonder
whether we had proved the existence of <em>God</em>. Of the big three
classical &ldquo;theistic&rdquo; arguments, only Anselm&rsquo;s
ontological argument (Anselm 1077), focused not on explanation but on
facts about the nature of the divine alone, brings into view anything
like the value-laden properties needed for a religious conception of
transcendence. But the greatest possible being referenced by it might
conceivably be something quite different from a personal creator
possessed of all power, knowledge, and goodness. Now this last point
needn&rsquo;t produce any worry at all for people willing to
contemplate a religious commitment not specifically centered on
traditional theism
 (<a href="">sections 5&ndash;7</a>
 will feature plenty of examples), and so investigation of ontological
arguments might fruitfully continue among those promoting the way of
argument. A more serious worry is that these arguments, including even
the quite sophisticated instances found in recent philosophy, are
embroiled in difficulties such as an apparent tendency to beg the
question or to invite quite non-religious parodies that seem equally
strong (see, e.g., Everitt 2004, Oppy 1995, and Sobel 2004).</p>

<p>
As one might expect, contemporary theistic philosophers have noticed
the problem about a scarcity of religious content. They have responded
in two main ways. The first response involves <em>extending</em> the
classical sort of argumentation, moving it closer to religious terrain
with reasoning intended to allow the inference that God exists.
Consider the ancient Arabic <em>kal&#257;m</em> cosmological argument,
recently returned to popularity (Craig 1979), which speaks vaguely of
the universe having a beginning which something caused. To it one may
add premises stating that only a personal being able to exercise free
will could have caused the beginning of the existence of our universe
(for this and other examples of such augmented reasoning, see Craig
&amp; Moreland 2009). But while such premises, perhaps with the help
of others even more conspicuously religious, may allow the problem of
religiously limited inferential power to be overcome, another
liability familiar to those who work with arguments, that of
questionable plausibility in one&rsquo;s premises, is often thereby
introduced. Such extensions have generally been no more convincing for
those not antecedently committed to them than the reasoning they
extend (for criticism of the <em>kal&#257;m</em> extension, see
Morriston 2000).</p>

<p>
It is in this context that we can understand the significance of the
second response to the problem about scarce religious
content&mdash;the Bayesian approach that entered the philosophy of
religion in the 1970s. This approach involves an inductive or
probabilistic reformulation of traditional arguments aimed precisely
at providing support for the existence of God as religiously
understood. Here many of the traditional arguments, teleological,
cosmological, and so on, are converted into more modest confirmational
arguments, each of which is intended to add to the probability of the
full theistic conclusion, regarded as an explanatory hypothesis in the
Bayesian way. And these various confirmational arguments, taken
together or cumulatively, are supposed&mdash;sometimes with some help
from religious experience&mdash;to make that hypothesis overall
probable (Swinburne 2004; for a significant Bayesian version of
specifically teleological reasoning that exploits
&ldquo;finetuning&rdquo; results in physics, see Collins 2009).</p>

<p>
Where the Bayesian approach runs into trouble is in its probability
assignments, which are often controversial. Should we, for example,
take the existence of a complex physical universe to be more likely on
the hypothesis that God exists than on its denial? When we consider
that its denial, the claim that God does not exist, is equivalent to a
huge disjunction, which says that this or that or some other
nontheistic possibility is realized, we may well find it hard to tell
(Draper 2016a). One of the most disputed issues in this area concerns
the important matter of how probable the God-hypothesis is
<em>before</em> its power to explain the various phenomena of
experience is taken into account. Clearly, unless this
&ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; or &ldquo;prior&rdquo; probability is judged
to be reasonably high, any number of arguments that increase the
probability of that religious hypothesis might even jointly be
insufficient to bring its overall probability to the level that the
theist needs it to attain. Now the <em>simplicity</em> of a
hypothesis, which is to say its relative lack of complexity, may be
thought to determine its prior probability and to allow for everything
needed in the theistic case (Swinburne 1997, 2004). But the first half
of this proposal is controversial (Gr&uuml;nbaum 2008, Sober 2015,
Willard 2014) and other proposals on the determination of prior
probability in the case of God&rsquo;s existence challenge the second
half (Draper 2016b, Poston 2020). Discussion of these matters
continues, as it should.</p>

<p>
Another traditional application of the way of argument involves the
notion of <em>odd or unusual events</em>, which the arguer seeks to
show are realized in a manner inviting supernatural explanation and
the label &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;. Such argumentation, its philosophical
advocate may note, lends itself to use in various religious contexts.
Not just God, but other possible deities and also human beings able to
command religiously transcendent power, might be able to perform
miracles if there is a religiously transcendent dimension to reality,
thus bringing rational credibility to the associated religious
propositions and to religious commitments based on them.</p>

<p>
But this version of the argumentative approach faces problems, too.
One is that its use in &ldquo;various religious contexts&rdquo;
generates an inconsistent set of religious claims, all supported in
just the same way&mdash;by what appear to be miracles. The eighteenth
century philosopher David Hume saw this, arguing that the force of any
one religious miracle claim is therefore canceled by that of the rest
(Hume 1748). Another interesting problem concerns the justice of such
events, which, at least if religiously relevant, are likely to involve
a healing or some other positively evaluable event that leave many
sufferers or otherwise needy people who face much the same troubling
circumstances out in the cold (Overall 1985). The religious community
hoping to make use of such events in the intellectual domain had
better be one that can tolerate such apparently arbitrary
discrimination.</p>

<p>
Quite apart from these issues, there is a cluster of problems
concerning the very idea of a miracle that any proponent of
miracle-based argumentation must work to solve. These arise because a
miracle of the relevant kind must be more than just an astonishing and
unusual event: the religious argument requires what Hume called a
<em>violation of natural law</em>&mdash;in more contemporary terms, a
&ldquo;nonrepeatable counterinstance&rdquo; to a law of nature (Hume
1748; Swinburne 1970: 26). Only this invites a supernatural
explanation. And even if one does not think, as Hume did, that the
evidence supporting the notion that such an event has occurred can
never be stronger than the evidence supporting a contrary view made
available by the law itself, one would still need to show that our
understanding of natural regularities has indeed been
contravened&mdash;that no laws of nature known to us will cover the
event. For another thing, one would need reasonable support for the
view that the &ldquo;law&rdquo; violated is a true law, and not one
that might be replaced by science in the future. Finally, one would
need reason to suppose that invoking a religious entity or power by
way of explanation puts us further ahead, intellectually, than
regarding any real violation as a freak event whose occurrence is a
brute fact with no explanation at all. Perhaps a premise stating or
implying that all these conditions have been satisfied will one day be
satisfactorily defended, but we shouldn&rsquo;t expect this to be an
easy job. (For relevant discussion, see Mackie 1982 and Swinburne
1970.) Indeed, here we have a fine illustration of the challenge to
traditional religious thought represented by the progress of
science.</p>

<p>
The way of argument, as we have seen, though rightly advertised as
potentially a direct route to establishing concordance between reason
and religious commitment, faces a number of difficulties. And we
haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the vulnerability it must accept to
arguments on the other side of the religious question, however the
latter is answered&mdash;if the answer is theistic, these will of
course be arguments against theism such as the argument from evil (for
recent work on this, see Draper forthcoming) and the hiddenness
argument (Schellenberg 2015). Such difficulties might be overcome in
the future, though there is no reason for theists or others in the
religious community to be sanguine on this point. (A noteworthy
attempt to resolve the main issues concerning theism through a
dialogue more careful and respectful than most is Rasmussen &amp; Leon
2019.) What religious people might also hope the future will bring is
more modest and (thus) more promising argumentation: reasoning aimed,
not at establishing the rational credibility of specific, detailed
religious propositions like those found in much traditional religion,
but at supporting the barer, more general claim <em>that there is a
religiously ultimate reality</em>, or <em>that some religiously
transcendent reality exists</em>. Such reasoning might have to include
reference to alleged experience of the reality in question, which,
given the phenomenological content of such experience, would
immediately deliver a connection to value-related and thus religiously
relevant considerations. (This need not produce any overlap with the
way of experience, discussed below, which as we&rsquo;ll see does not
involve arguing from premises about religious experience to a
religious conclusion.) It&rsquo;s worth noting that even the modest
claim about religious transcendence, precisely because of its
religious character, gives us much more to work with than just the
notion that there is <em>something</em> beyond nature. Should this
religious proposition be made convincing by argument, there would be
clear consequences for living to which one might reasonably bind
oneself in a religious commitment&mdash;if only the consequence that
one ought devotedly to seek a fuller understanding of the nature of
this reality that by definition embodies, and can transmit to human
life, surpassing value.</p>

<h2 id="WayExpe">3. The Way of Experience</h2>

<p>
It is easy to see how an appeal to special experiences might seem a
natural recourse when credentials are sought in the context of
religion. From time immemorial, saints and seers have claimed a closer
proximity to the divine than ordinary experience affords. But in the
context of philosophy one may labor to locate its relevance. Here the
sentiment felt more frequently is that of John Locke, who derided
&ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; free of rational oversight (1690 [1975]
IV.19.2). Nevertheless, in the last few decades an experiential
approach has found its way to the center of attention in philosophical
discussions of religious credentials, too. And the religious
experiences not just of seers and saints but of ordinary people in the
midst of day to day life have come to be viewed as highly
relevant.</p>

<p>
This shift was precipitated by the work of philosophers who take their
cue from what lived religious commitments are really like, maintaining
that there need be no mismatch between how such commitments are
actually rooted, when as so frequently their source is religious
experience rather than argument, and what will prove satisfying to
reason in the context of philosophy. On this approach, even when
religious persons are unable to find other beliefs from whose content
the content of their religious beliefs can successfully be
<em>inferred</em>, deductively, inductively, or abductively, in the
manner emphasized by the way of argument, the latter beliefs may still
be grounded <em>directly</em> in experiential circumstances, whether
these should involve receipt of a dramatic vision apparently of
religious realities or only a humble background sense apparently of
God&rsquo;s sustaining presence.</p>

<p>
One way of describing what&rsquo;s said to be rationally permitted
here is the following: even when religious believers don&rsquo;t
believe on the basis of propositional evidence, their religious
beliefs can appropriately be <em>basic</em>, alongside other basic
beliefs (beliefs not based on other beliefs) that we legitimately
form, such as the belief, in the midst of calculation, that 2 x 3 = 6
or, as noon approaches, that one is feeling hungry or, looking out a
window, that it&rsquo;s snowing outside. Epistemological strictures
that would rule this out can be argued to be self-refuting or
arbitrary in some way (Plantinga 2000). Or one may focus specifically
on the beliefs sent our way by the senses, arguing that there is an
analogy between sensory experience and perceptually structured
religious experiences such that if&mdash;as most philosophers would
accept&mdash;the former can rationally justify sensory belief, the
latter can rationally justify the parallel sort of religious belief
(Alston 1991, Wainwright 1973a). In further defense of this view it
has been maintained that support for the reliability of fundamental
belief-forming practices like the sensory belief-forming practice is
inevitably circular: the support that can be adduced always ends up
including premises drawn from the practices themselves (Alston 1991).
Why do we accept such practices, despite this circularity? Because
they are &ldquo;firmly established, psychologically and
socially&rdquo; (Alston 1991: 149&ndash;151). But this is also true of
the religious practice of forming beliefs in response to religious
experience. Again&mdash;or so it may be held&mdash;an instructive
analogy.</p>

<p>
It is worth noting at this point an interesting connection between the
way of experience, as thus far illustrated, and the way of argument
discussed above. Although the former is supposed to represent an
alternative to the latter, it too will often involve the development
of arguments. The difference is that the arguments it will involve are
arguments <em>against</em> attempts to defeat the rational
justification purportedly offered by experience rather than arguments
<em>for</em> the truth of any religious claim. What&rsquo;s supposed
to rationally justify believing religious claims when one employs the
way of experience is, appropriately enough, experience not argument.
However to make the experiential justification stick in the face of
objections to it, successful arguments against objections will often
be needed, and the philosopher following the way of experience ought
to be able to supply them.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s now consider what would usually be regarded as the two
most difficult objections to the experiential approach, and some of
the reasoning on which such a philosopher might draw when responding.
The first objection argues against religious experiential beliefs in
much the same way that Hume argued against accepting miracle reports:
the apparent force of their support is canceled by the similar support
available to religious people holding experiential beliefs with
incompatible content. (For relevant discussion, see Goldberg 2014,
Johnson 2020, Pittard 2019, Quinn &amp; Meeker 2000, and Schellenberg
2007.) The Christian claims that her soul has been saved by God, the
Buddhist that there is no soul and no God, and both appeal to
experiential support for their beliefs!</p>

<p>
The problem here, it may be thought, arises because there is no
trans-religious system of shared beliefs about the world useful for
weeding out false claims, to which the Buddhist and Christian might
appeal in order to resolve the dispute between them (Alston 1991).
Suppose that&rsquo;s so. What should religious practitioners do in its
absence? Everyone sit tight, hoping that fuller illumination will come
in time? That&rsquo;s one option. Slip from belief into doubt as you
contemplate the force of the conflict in your evidence and promote a
much deeper and wider religious investigation, hoping to help
<em>bring</em> such illumination? That&rsquo;s another. It may seem
that if we follow the second suggestion, which pays more visible
respect to reason, we must give up the way of experience. But,
interestingly, that is not the case. This is because of what was said
in section 1 about how a religious commitment can manage without
belief of any religious claim, substituting for belief something like
a voluntary acceptance or trust or assumption or imaginative assent.
Here we may add that the psychological effects of a religious
experience can survive the loss of beliefs initially engendered by it.
Someone who has a religious experience may, for example, find herself
with a richer sense of what&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> in reality that
lingers even after she no longer believes those possibilities to be
real. Wishing to explore such possibilities, she may choose to
continue following the path marked out by religious experience even
when in doubt, with the non-doxastic (nonbelieving) adoption of some
alternative propositional attitude a central part of this chosen
condition.</p>

<p>
But would it be reasonable to behave like this? Arguably, it could be.
(For a defense of such behavior in a specifically Christian context,
see Alston 1996 and Howard-Snyder 2017b.) Doubt is the respect one
pays to reason. And here one has paid it. So in this scenario there is
no longer any belief for which one might be expected to have epistemic
(truth-oriented) support, and the rules of the game change. Now
<em>pragmatic</em> considerations&mdash;considerations having to do
with the benefits, for oneself and/or others, associated with such a
commitment&mdash;come into their own, introducing their own quite
different reasons into the discussion. The pragmatic value of a
religious commitment may be considerable (Schellenberg 2009). Hence
these reasons may seem to strongly support its continuance.</p>

<p>
Perhaps, though, it will seem that the shift from belief to a
non-doxastic attitude is too small a shift to be able to offer reason
<em>all</em> the respect it deserves in these circumstances, given
that the same specific religious propositions are still in view and in
some sense treated as true&mdash;and this despite the evident
competition from other specific propositions similarly supported. If
so, there is yet another move available to the advocate of the
experiential approach that may facilitate a rational religious
commitment. This would involve seeing what everyone&rsquo;s religious
experience suggests as a quite <em>general</em> possibility, one
general enough to be consistent with the falsehood of all the detailed
religious beliefs that have ever been held (Franks Davis 1989). And it
would mean seeking to adjust one&rsquo;s commitment so that, while
remaining pragmatically valuable, it centers on this more general
content rather than on any specific religious proposition. What might
the general content be? One option is to take our cue from the end of
the preceding section, where a new argumentative focus on the claim
that there is a religiously ultimate reality, or that some religiously
transcendent reality exists, was considered. The move we have been
exploring might be seen as bringing religious experience into the same
neighborhood.</p>

<p>
A second objection to the experiential approach was promised. It is
this. Religious experiences can be naturally explained&mdash;for
example, neurologically, as suggested by the fact that qualitatively
similar experiences have been produced through appropriate stimulation
of the brain (Fales 2019, 2021). Why then would someone believe that
such an experience was putting them in touch with God or some other
transcendent reality? The point needn&rsquo;t be that this could not
be the case, with God, say, using a subject&rsquo;s brain to generate
the experience. It might rather be that given our knowledge of the
brain&rsquo;s ability to produce such experiences
independently&mdash;surely we don&rsquo;t think God is at the mercy of
a brain probe?&mdash;anyone in the grip of a religious experience is
faced with the question: How do we know this isn&rsquo;t one of those
times? (Schellenberg 2007). The experience can&rsquo;t give us an
answer to this question; it is only the occasion for its being posed.
As such it will rationally lead us into doubt as to the source of the
experience rather than engendering religious belief. Or so it may be
said.</p>

<p>
This objection again illustrates how science has become a thorn in the
side for religion. How may the advocate of the way of experience
respond? One response has it that sensory experiences can be explained
in much the same way, and yet this does not prevent us from reasonably
relying on <em>them</em> in the context of the <em>sensory</em>
belief-forming practice. The objector, so it may be said, is imposing
an arbitrary double standard (Alston 1991). An important difference,
however, which may seem to make the double standard appropriate rather
than arbitrary in this case is that we cannot function as human
beings, and nor can we so much as get started in inquiry, without
sensory beliefs. Nothing like this is true for religious beliefs
(Schellenberg 2007). Millions have lost them, precisely through
inquiry&mdash;inquiry of the sort that religious beliefs themselves
often serve to stifle. Discussion of this and other relevant issues
continues&mdash;see, for example, Barrett 2007, Cunningham 2011, Fales
1996, Gellman 2001, Jordan 1994, and Wainwright 1973b. Notice that
even if our second objection appears forceful, religious practitioners
will still have available to them the same additional responses we
noted before, which involve shifting from a doxastic to a non-doxastic
form of religious commitment, and from epistemic to pragmatic
considerations as support. (If we were talking about whether religious
belief can be justified, the discussion might have ended earlier, but
religious <em>commitment</em> is more resilient.) Notice that
experience may still rule the day if one activates one of these
alternative responses. For it may be because of what religious
experience has revealed in the way of religious possibilities and
benefits that one does so.</p>

<h2 id="WayTest">4. The Way of Testimony</h2>

<p>
John Locke, as we saw at the beginning of the preceding section,
expressed a certain wariness about religious experience. But the
alternative he had in mind, when, good Protestant that he was, he took
his turn at defending a Christian commitment, was not strictly
argumentative. There is a third alternative to consider in the
traditional repertoire, when seeking to shore up the rational
credentials of religion, which Locke stresses when speaking of how the
revelation of God makes its way to us via many decidedly more ordinary
communicants, who may nonetheless have earned our trust (1690 [1975]
IV.18.3). He did not entrust himself entirely to the way of testimony
when defending religious commitment, but others might. Our question
now is how we might try to make this work.</p>

<p>
At first, one may wonder how the way of testimony <em>could</em> work,
since even if we go with one of the more robust recent definitions,
all one sees in testimony is someone giving expression to information,
intending to pass it along (Lackey 2008). For us to become interested,
or so it initially appears, the information expressed would have to be
religious in nature&mdash;about (religiously) transcendent things. And
it&rsquo;s not obvious how someone telling you that God is real or
that Jesus is the way to God or that following the Noble Eightfold
Path will engender enlightenment or some other such thing could all by
itself give you a reason of any significant force to believe what
they&rsquo;re communicating or otherwise take it on board in a manner
relevant to the origin or retention of a religious commitment.</p>

<p>
Here we will be reminded of how very much we rely on testimony in
everyday life. We could hardly do without it while feeding ourselves,
finding cures when ill, getting around in the world, or understanding
the world&rsquo;s past. We use it all the time, and most
epistemologists simply take it for granted that testimony can be a
source of rational belief, even if just how it functions as such is
still somewhat unclear (Audi 2004, Greco 2020, Fricker 2004, Lackey
2008, Sosa 2010). What&rsquo;s coming into view is an analogy argument
analogous to the argument about sensory and religious experience
examined in the preceding section: if we accept that testimony can be
a source of reasonable belief in <em>ordinary</em> contexts, as of
course we do, we should accept that it can be a source of reasonable
belief in <em>religious</em> contexts, too.</p>

<p>
This argument is still too blunt for anyone to have given it just that
form, even if we add that the word &ldquo;can&rdquo; is significant
and demands sensitive treatment. Indeed, a number of distinctions will
need our attention as we seek to clarify how the way of testimony
might best be articulated and defended. The first one raises an early
problem for our new approach. Are we thinking about the
<em>generation</em> through testimony of a reason to believe some
information or about the <em>transmission</em> by means of testimony
of information that was originally certified on independent grounds?
(Greco 2020 makes the distinction in these terms.) If the former, then
inquiry into the quality of the testimony has to be undertaken and
turned into a good argument for the reasonableness of trusting it,
which is to say that what starts out as a testimonial approach must,
if it hopes to be convincing, be converted into an instance of the
argumentative approach. If the latter, then advocates of the way of
testimony can&rsquo;t really hope to be able to pacify reason unless
they can first confirm the original and independent certification, and
the way of testimony is again prevented from being able to deliver the
goods all by itself. Either way, or so it may be said, the testimonial
approach can&rsquo;t be made to work as advertised.</p>

<p>
Many lines of thought about possible collaborations between the way of
testimony and other ways might depart from this point. But let&rsquo;s
not give up on the way of testimony as a self-sufficient resource just
yet. Perhaps other distinctions will help us resolve the dilemma.
There is, for example, a very pertinent distinction between individual
and social contexts of inquiry. Social forms of epistemology (the
study of knowledge and justified belief), including the epistemology
of testimony, have taken off in a big way in recent years, and this
phenomenon has rightly prompted philosophers to be more sensitive to
how social factors contribute to the rational justification of our
beliefs. Many would now say that the facts about our interaction as
human beings are such that in the absence of reasons to distrust
someone, we normally have reason to take their word for it when they
tell us something is true, instead of being required to embark on some
inquiry into their trustworthiness (Goldman 1999, Plantinga 1993,
Williamson 2000). But in that case we have reason to doubt whether the
receipt of testimony must always prompt a search for arguments
supporting the latter&rsquo;s quality if it is to be generative of
rational justification, as would be required for the dilemma posed
above to have any force.</p>

<p>
The issue lurking here about what exactly we should demand of
testimonial justifications remains controversial, though the less
demanding view on which this response relies is today common among
epistemologists. We might seek to add to its plausibility by teasing
out some details about how that word &ldquo;normally&rdquo; applies.
But right here one can also sense the presence of a problem: the
supernaturalist or transcendent content of religious propositions,
considered in the midst of everything else we take on testimony,
certainly looks quite exceptional, and so perhaps we have good reason
to make an exception in the <em>religious</em> case, asking for more
or more diverse forms of support <em>here</em> than we normally would.
In which case the dilemma is reinstated.</p>

<p>
But once again the right distinctions may save the day for the way of
testimony. We need to look more closely at what exactly the
testimonial approach is supposed to support, and when we do we will
notice, from the distinction mentioned at the end of section 1, that
the options include both the <em>origination</em> of a religious
commitment and its <em>retention</em>. We should also remember the
non-doxastic option already referred to several times in previous
sections. So suppose that what we want to offer rational support to is
the retention of a religious commitment through the adoption, when in
doubt, of a non-doxastic propositional attitude that takes the place
of the religious belief one has lost. In the preceding section we saw
how pragmatic considerations may come into play at this point. So
suppose further that the person in question is told about the benefits
of thus retaining a religious commitment by someone who has
experienced it. Isn&rsquo;t this testimony? Notice that yet another
distinction is now required: between testimony that conveys religious
propositions and testimony that conveys <em>other</em> content like
that concerning the pragmatic benefits of a religious life. What we
are seeing is that our quite natural initial assumption that relevant
testimony must be of the former kind is false. And this opens up new
room to maneuver for the way of testimony. For with talk of the
pragmatic benefits of a certain style of living we are back in a more
ordinary domain, in normal circumstances, where even the critic may be
willing to allow that the less demanding view of testimonial
justification mentioned above applies.</p>

<p>
Thus with a few adjustments, one arguably can find some work for the
way of testimony to do. But is this all it can do? We might well wish
for something more robust&mdash;something that <em>would</em> enable
religious propositional content to be relevantly communicated. But
here a number of difficulties loom.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with another dilemma, which can be posed using the
origination-retention distinction. Suppose you are considering whether
to form a religious commitment for the first time, and entertain the
thought of testimonial support. Surely what will immediately come to
mind is the cacophony of diverse and conflicting religious voices from
around the world. <em>Whose</em> testimony should you accept, if
anyone&rsquo;s? There appears to be no way for testimony alone to help
you out in such a case, providing rational support for religious
commitment by the non-demanding route we opened up in order to defuse
the first dilemma. You aren&rsquo;t part of a religious social group
already, and so can&rsquo;t make use of any lenience in that respect
suggested by recent work in social epistemology. Careful further
investigation clearly seems to be required. And now suppose that you
<em>are</em> part of a religious social group, and are only looking
for the support needed to retain your commitment (suppose it to be a
believing commitment, in line with our present concern to investigate
a more robust role for the way of testimony). Might you lean on the
testimony of others in your community to gain a rational boost for
your flagging confidence in the relevant religious propositions? It
seems not, for here too there is an inhibiting factor. As a
participating member of this religious community, you have already
accepted all the religious testimony that others in your group are in
a position to share. How then can it be brought into play now? That
would be redundant. Thus we have our new dilemma: either way, whether
we&rsquo;re thinking about starting or about keeping a religious
commitment, religious testimony by itself is not going to be enough to
get you reason&rsquo;s approval.</p>

<p>
One might object to what&rsquo;s said here by noting that there do
seem to be people who take up a religious commitment for the first
time while in an important sense part of a religious
community&mdash;namely, the young, who frequently become devoted to a
religious life by trusting the word of a parent or friend or teacher.
But the way of testimony would not produce a very interesting result
about rational support for the initiation of a religious commitment if
it had to lean on someone&rsquo;s immaturity to acquire it. So there
is reason to restrict our attention on the initiation side to adults
capable of thoughtful reflection, and to evaluate the present dilemma
with this restriction in mind.</p>

<p>
On the other side, the side of retention (which might of course become
relevant for those who were drawn into a religious life in their
youth), a different possible response may be noted. The content of
religious testimony is not just the conjunction or total set of all
the religious propositions your group adheres to, which you have
already taken into account. It can also include, among other things,
what your religious community, considered collectively, is
communicating to you about the mistakenness of your course when you
move in the direction of relinquishing the commitment that, until
recently, you have gladly shared with them. In such circumstances, you
might conscientiously treat your community as an <em>authority</em>,
judging it more likely that you will be aligned with the good and the
true as you would see it after ideal reflection if you take the word
of your community on this matter than if you try to figure things out
for yourself, relying on what your own mind is telling you now
(Zagzebski 2012).</p>

<p>
What should we say about this response? It does suggest that a more
subtle view of religious testimony is needed than one finds on the
second side of our second dilemma. But it&rsquo;s also true that the
response is led by the point it emphasizes into dangerous territory.
As a commentator has recently put it, relying on the authority of
one&rsquo;s community in the way here described</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
provides all of the resources for rendering rational the beliefs of
paradigmatically irrational communities, such as white supremacists,
cults, and terrorists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
fails to provide the resources for rationally rejecting an
authority&rsquo;s testimony when what is offered is obviously false or
otherwise outrageous. (Lackey 2017: 217)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On balance, then, it is questionable whether the response can succeed,
and we are left with nothing that might generate a more robust role
for the way of testimony than the one discussed earlier, in connection
with non-doxastic religious commitments.</p>

<p>
However discussion continues, as it should. Among the questions worth
considering in the future, as can be seen after investigation of our
first three, more-or-less traditional, ways of trying to make
religious commitment rationally unproblematic, are whether and how
these various approaches might be combined. Each faces challenges, but
maybe they can work more successfully together. Perhaps, for example,
stronger future arguments for theistic conclusions will in some way
make use of theistic religious experience. Something like this has
already been attempted in the context of the most prominent Bayesian
version of the argumentative approach (Swinburne 2004). And maybe if
testimonial reports about God&rsquo;s ways found in theistic
traditions were in the future to agree more fully, they could
rationally facilitate the step from bare theism to a more detailed
theistic perspective for someone convinced by argument of the truth of
the former. Or perhaps, moving in a less conventional direction, some
future argument for one of the more general religious propositions
will be complemented by a more widely experienced sense of a divine
presence, with the rationality of a corresponding religious commitment
buttressed by the testimony of many to its benefits. <em>Various</em>
hybrid possibilities involving the three approaches together may now
suggest themselves&mdash;and perhaps all the better given the clearer
view we have achieved of each separately.</p>

<h2 id="InefWay">5. The Ineffabilist Way</h2>

<p>
Our new way is linked to a line of thought found in a number of quite
different traditional religious communities, Buddhist, Hindu, and
Christian, among others (for examples, see Hick 1989 [2004]). But to
gain sight of this option, one must as it were stand off to one side
of what has most commonly drawn attention in these communities,
letting one&rsquo;s eyes get used to the dark. Thus with it we begin
our move away from approaches that recommend themselves within the
bright and busy center of traditional religiousness.</p>

<p>
What becomes visible from this adjusted perspective are some quite
basic religious reasons for thinking of the divine as
<em>ineffable</em>&mdash;as in some way or to some extent beyond the
power of rational, discursive thought to conceive or language to
describe. Given the transcendence of the divine and the sort of
transcendence we&rsquo;re dealing with here, so reflection may
suggest, it is through an openness to the opaque and by spiritual
means that contact with the divine will be made, with this contact
being of a distinctive sort, involving knowledge from direct
acquaintance generated by mystical religious experience rather than
propositional knowledge (knowing-that). If this is what the religious
can say, then what may appear to recommend itself is also a new way of
protecting a religious commitment from rational criticism (additional
to any suggested by reflection on mystical religious experience
itself). Indeed, it may seem that religious transcendence works
<em>for</em> us in this regard: the very transcendent greatness of the
divine, and the sort of response to it that a discerning religiousness
will affirm, make an ineffabilist religious commitment
appealing&mdash;and the religious commitment of an
<em>ineffabilist</em> must surely be off limits for reason. What is
there for reason to object to where religion is silent?</p>

<p>
Now it&rsquo;s certainly true that if a religious community is chary
about describing the divine, there will be less in its midst for
reason to get a grip on or its teeth into. But a problem immediately
presents itself with respect to what is still being affirmed here: How
can a religiously transcendent reality truly be ineffable if we can
say this much about it: that it is religiously transcendent and
ineffable (Alston 1956)? This is a pretty <em>basic</em> rational
problem, one involving apparent inconsistency.</p>

<p>
Evidently we need to give some more attention to how the ineffability
claim may be interpreted. Does the ineffabilist really have to
maintain that <em>nothing</em> can truly be said by way of a
description of the divine? Attempts have been made to remove the
rational troublesomeness of so radical a claim (Alston 1956, G&auml;b
2017, Hick 1989 [2004], Jones 2016, Sells 1994, Smart 1958), though
without clear success. It is perhaps fortunate, then, that religious
thinkers haven&rsquo;t often wanted to go that far. Although they will
often say things that lend themselves to the absolutist
interpretation&mdash;here is an example from the fifteenth century
German thinker Nicholas of Cusa: &ldquo;In Himself God is ineffable
and beyond all that can be named or spoken of&rdquo;&mdash;from the
other side of the mouth they will often say things that soften it.
Nicholas, for one, in the same breath said that &ldquo;as Creator, God
is trine [sic] and one&rdquo; (1453 [1990: 681], Klibansky &amp;
Bascour 1970). Another example: the first lines of the Taoist
scripture, the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, are usually regarded as
paradigmatically ineffabilist: &ldquo;The Tao that can be expressed is
not the eternal Tao&rdquo; (<em>Tao Te Ching</em> [1982: 17]). And yet
a few lines further on, in this and dozens of other translations, the
inexpressible Tao is said to be the source of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>
In the present context it&rsquo;s helpful to note that ineffabilism
has been brought into view only because it may help us solve a
philosophical problem. An advocate of the ineffabilist way, as we are
construing it, need say no more than is required to elicit
reason&rsquo;s toleration or support for a religious commitment. So,
especially since even some religious ineffabilists are giving us the
green light, let&rsquo;s see if something less than <em>absolute</em>
ineffability might make religious sense and also allow that goal to be
reached.</p>

<p>
Here are five formulations of a less-than-absolute or limited
religious ineffabilism worth considering.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li id="form1">We can know that what makes the divine divine must be
very great, worthy of the highest evaluation possible, but the
features that merit <em>this</em> appellation are ineffable.</li>

<li id="form2">Although we can know some of the properties a divine
reality would have, and indeed must have, facts about what it is like
for those properties to be instantiated or <em>realized</em> in the
divine are ineffable.</li>

<li id="form3">While the non-relational properties of God are out of
reach, ineffable, we can have knowledge of God&rsquo;s
<em>relational</em> properties: for example, we can know that the
universe depends for its existence on God.</li>

<li id="form4">It is the correct <em>understanding</em> of the divine
nature that is forever unavailable to us: even if some things about
the divine can be known, the most general and fundamental truths about
the divine nature are so distant that they are ineffable, and so the
divine nature cannot, even in a basic way, be
&ldquo;comprehended&rdquo; by the human mind.</li>

<li id="form5">The divine nature is infinitely great, and although
some of this greatness is accessible to us and describable, no matter
how far a human being may reach in its ability to rationally and
linguistically embrace it, there must, given human finitude, always be
a <em>limit</em>&mdash;beyond which lies the divine ineffability.</li>
</ol>

<p>

 <a href="#form1">(1)</a>
 still seems quite radical; notice that on its view we probably ought
even to withhold the descriptor &ldquo;transcendent&rdquo;.
 <a href="#form3">(2)</a>
 is plausible enough. For example, suppose we think the divine is a
personal God, who forms intentions. What it is for God to intend
something might still be rather different from what it is for us, and
indeed beyond description (Alston 1989: 198). But ineffability here
borders on the banal and obvious, applying as it does even to the
everyday experiences of finite beings: How can you really describe
what it&rsquo;s like from the inside for <em>you</em> to form an
intention?
 <a href="#form3">(3)</a>
 is suggested by, among others, Maimonides, who distinguishes between
attributes of God&rsquo;s essence and attributes of God&rsquo;s action
(1190 [1963]: I, 53). But while contemplation of the latter might no
doubt feed a religious stance, it distracts us from ineffability per
se&mdash;if the one who undertakes it is managing both rationally and
religiously, this is not in <em>virtue</em> of ineffability, the way
of managing to be explored in this section, but in spite of it.
 <a href="#form4">(4)</a>
 is interesting, exploiting as it does the distinction, common these
days, between knowledge, which can be isolated and atomic, and
understanding, which involves making connections across various items
of believed and true information, seeing how things fit together into
a larger picture (Grimm 2018, Kvanvig 2003, Zagzebski 1996). How could
we ever have access to the facts that bring within reach the
&ldquo;larger picture&rdquo; of God?
 <a href="#form5">(5)</a>
 is also appealing&mdash;it could be regarded as a more plausible
version of the idea behind (1)&mdash;and even indicates a certain
sensitivity to reason in what it says about the unbridgeable gap
between finite and infinite. Nicholas of Cusa seems to have something
like it in mind: &ldquo;God is so great that there is no end of his
Greatness. Hence, he is greater than everything conceived and
knowable&rdquo; (1462 [1998: ch. 12, N. 32]). And (4) is compatible
with (5): the facts beyond the greatness-conceivability limit
mentioned by the latter could be precisely those, or among those,
access to which is required for the understanding referred to by the
former.</p>

<p>
So let&rsquo;s take (4) and (5) together and reflect on them a little
further. In particular, how could it be argued that religious
commitment evades rational critique if we accept these two together or
in conjunction? The basic idea, presumably, is going to be that any
rational criticism of a religious commitment which includes acceptance
of this conjunction can be rejected as rash and unreliable, since now
we&rsquo;d have to say that the truths about the nature of a divine
reality that are inaccessible to us on account of its unfathomable
depths, if we could add them to what we already know, might very well
lead to an understanding that requires us to qualify or renounce the
criticism. Lacking any good reason to rule this out, objectors cannot
forcefully press their objections. (Notice how the situation here is
different from that of the traditional theists featured in
 <a href="">section 2</a>,
 who suppose that a basic understanding of the divine nature
<em>is</em> attainable by combining the idea of ultimacy with the idea
of a personal agent.) Reason can&rsquo;t get a serious grip
on&mdash;can&rsquo;t even properly understand&mdash;the idea giving
shape to an ineffabilist religious commitment, and so its framing of a
clear and convincing critique of that idea is infinitely
postponed.</p>

<p>
But our theme is religious <em>commitment</em>, and this might invite
criticism even if no religious <em>idea</em> does. Here, for example,
is a criticism it will surely be tempting to make: How can the
commitment of a religious person even <em>have</em> any shape if they
go the ineffabilist route?</p>

<p>
This, however, must now be easier to answer, given that our
ineffabilist isn&rsquo;t looking to deprive the religious idea that
there is a divine reality of <em>all</em> content, willing as she is
to think of such a reality as being, at least, transcendent and
unsurpassably great. Reason may need more information than this to
know whether its critiques are on track, but religion can manage just
fine without it. Indeed, right here one can see a distinctive shape
for religious commitment emerging: humbly acknowledging human
ignorance, not distracted by the pursuit of propositional
understanding or overly concerned about belief states attained or
absent, we submit to meditation and contemplation prescribed by those
who have gone before and eventually gain a deeper experiential sense
of a wondrous reality seemingly responsive to our efforts and luring
us further on. (A sense of ineffable greatness nurtured by mystical
experience can be very motivating.) Using whatever we receive, in
individual exploration and communal interaction, we engage in a
pursuit that must, if successful, be everlasting&mdash;pursuit of a
unity mimicking the unified understanding that <em>reason</em> seeks,
which too lies on the further side of all our efforts. Employing the
language of our community (though perhaps treating much of it as
useful fiction), we seek an ever deeper integration of the physical,
emotional, social, aesthetic and other aspects of our being under the
notion of a wondrously elusive divine reality that (metaphorically) is
calling <em>all</em> things to unity with itself.</p>

<p>
This is one way of describing the basic features of a livable, if
austere, ineffabilist religious commitment that has gone some way
toward a reconciliation with reason. Just how it is described will
vary depending on which tradition or religious community one has in
mind. But it does appear that all who belong to a religious community
can be given an ineffabilist interpretation to work with, if they are
willing to stand with the ineffabilist to one side of conventional
opinion, taking in the view from there. (Of course not everyone will
be willing, so not everyone&rsquo;s religious commitment is going to
be benefited here.) Solid arguments for metaphysical naturalism would
still pose a serious problem for this approach&mdash;as indeed for any
of the other approaches discussed in this entry. But, as intimated in
section 1, naturalism&rsquo;s cultural advancements have come in a
manner that does not conspicuously feature arguments: with the path to
naturalism apparently smoothed by science, relatively few naturalists
have felt the impulse to seek reasoning that would prove or
probabilify their view. In any case, such reasoning is unlikely to be
available anytime soon (a justification for this position will be
suggested in section 7).</p>

<h2 id="PlurWay">6. The Pluralist Way</h2>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve had occasion, more than once, to notice how conflicts
among the commitments of the religious, especially at the intellectual
level, can be exploited by those who think ill of such commitments. In
the same connection, we have seen how a religious commitment that
de-emphasizes details, in one way or another focusing on general
rather than specific ideas about the divine, apparently can avoid the
problem. Is it also possible to avoid it by in some way&mdash;the
right way, if there is one&mdash;focusing precisely on the diverse and
apparently incompatible details of religion around the world? A
pluralist approach to the reconciliation of reason and religious
commitment will work with this idea, aiming to turn a problem into a
solution. Its advocates will not just sidestep the problem of
religious conflict, as we have seen it is possible to do, but seek to
make a form of religiousness that incorporates religious diversity
both religiously and rationally appealing.</p>

<p>
This is a tall order. But by meeting its demands religion apparently
would indeed have a more universally applicable way of making peace
with reason. That is because the problem of religious disagreement is
arguably the most basic problem facing those who would defend the
<em>ordinary</em> sort of religious commitment, resplendent with
details. After other problems are solved, there is still this one. No
matter how strong the support for your own specific religiousness
appears (for example, on the basis of argument) when you ignore
others, it will be countered when you allow them in, for now you have
the obligation of investigating their implicit claim against
you&mdash;the intellectual process here recapitulates the historical.
And if <em>this</em> problem is solved, others may go away too. For to
reach such a solution to the problem of religious disagreement, the
religious situation must be reconceived. And assuming the
non-viability of an exclusivist reaction to other examples of
religiousness, as almost everyone who takes the investigative
obligation mentioned above seriously supposes we should do (see, e.g.,
Byrne 2019, Hick 1989 [2004], McKim 2012, Smart 1996, and Smith 1992),
any religiousness that incorporates this solution will in some way
have to become more welcoming of views other than its own. Which means
that any specific religiousness may eventually be able to claim much
more than just its own religious argument and experience and testimony
as support for a religious form of life! Hence the attractiveness of
the pluralist way.</p>

<p>
How might we try to make it work? The best-known so-called pluralist
view in the philosophy of religion forwards a religious hypothesis
that borrows from Kant&rsquo;s distinction between the
&ldquo;noumenal&rdquo; and &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo;
realms&mdash;roughly, reality as it is in itself and as it appears to
us (Kant 1781). On this view the nature of the divine, the ultimate
&ldquo;Real&rdquo;, is &ldquo;transcategorial&rdquo; (Hick 2008: 5),
which is to say incapable of being captured in terms of any human
categories. The various conflicting religious claims are therefore all
on a level, equally bad at indicating the true nature of the divine.
However on the present view they are also on a level in a more
positive sense, by being equally <em>good</em> at helping to mediate
what the religious call salvation, facilitating the
&ldquo;transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to
Reality-centeredness&rdquo; (Hick 1989 [2004: 240]). This common
experience of salvation, so it is said, invites the hypothesis that
while the conflicting claims are culturally conditioned and none may
be regarded as literally true, their adherents, by following them, are
still responding to the same transcendent Real, which is present to
all of them as they are salvifically transformed (Hick 1989
[2004]).</p>

<p>
This view has been quite influential, but certain aspects of it have
also faced discerning criticism (see, e.g., Howard-Snyder 2017a, McKim
2012, and Plantinga 2000). In the present context, three main points
beg to be made. First, by adopting a Kantian strategy and construing
the Real as transcategorial, the advocate of this view is apparently
buying into part of the ineffabilist approach&mdash;and endorsing
<em>absolute</em> ineffabilism, to boot, which in the preceding
section we found to be problematic. One cannot really even think of
the transcendent reality as good or as salvific in any available sense
if one takes this line (McKim 2012), and so&mdash;by our own
definition here&mdash;it cannot if thus conceived be regarded as
religiously transcendent. Second, although that problem may be avoided
if the view is reinterpreted or revised in such a way as to reflect
one or another of the more limited ineffabilist views discussed in
section 5 or something like the more general content-retaining
religious views mentioned in sections 3 and 4, this would deprive it
of any independent value and so prevent it from representing a
distinct &ldquo;way&rdquo; of reconciling reason and religious
commitment. Third, although <em>that</em> problem could be avoided if
the emphasis on integrated diversity advertised by a
&ldquo;pluralistic hypothesis&rdquo; were to come through
successfully, it is in fact widely viewed as a weakness of the view we
are discussing that it sacrifices any truth-oriented engagement with
the diverse claims of religious communities around the world in order
to reach its results. Members of these communities are being asked to
completely alter their conception of what&rsquo;s going on when they
utter or hear indicative religious sentences expressing the details of
their intellectual commitment (indeed, to drop the idea that the
propositions these sentences express are literally true) instead of
being offered a way of harmonizing or working toward a harmonization
of their distinctive picture of the religious realm with the
distinctive pictures of others.</p>

<p>
We should therefore consider whether there is a view that
<em>does</em> credibly offer as much as that. Initially it&rsquo;s not
at all clear that one can successfully make a case for this
since&mdash;despite the famous tale of the blind men and the
elephant&mdash;the claims about transcendence of different religious
communities do conflict (our reference to Christianity versus Buddhism
in section 3 affords an example) and apparently cannot be fitted
together under the suggestion that each identifies a
&ldquo;part&rdquo; of the divine, just as each of the blind men has
identified a part of the elephant. That, indeed, is why the view we
have just been discussing asks religious people to make the big
sacrifice that involves giving up a truth-oriented construal of their
diverse understandings. However to deal with this issue a view of the
sort we are seeking may emphasize, not the present availability of
concordance, but rather <em>working toward</em> harmonization or
concordance, with everyone counseled to treat their specific religious
views differently from the more general idea of religious
transcendence&mdash;to in some way be willing to &ldquo;sit
loose&rdquo; from the former, open to the thought that they may need
to be revised or dropped in order to reach the goal of concordance,
harmonization, integration under the latter, which all the religiously
committed by definition accept. It is important to notice here that
treating specific views <em>differently</em> from others when engaging
them from a truth-oriented perspective need not mean sidelining or
rejecting or ignoring them, and so we are not simply returned to the
idea that religious people might flee to a more general level when
facing attack on specifics.</p>

<p>
Various contemporary writers can be seen as developing such a bi-level
and investigative pluralist proposal, for they speak of tentativeness
in one&rsquo;s specific religious beliefs or of reconceiving
one&rsquo;s specific religious beliefs as non-doxastic positions or of
some other such thing, always against a presumed backdrop of agreement
about there being something religiously transcendent as well as
ongoing inter-religious discussion as to its nature and the practical
consequences of its existence (Byrne 1995, Cobb 2006, McKim 2012, and
Schellenberg 2017 are examples). What we see here is indeed just a way
of developing, or a small extension to, one of the most popular
responses to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion today,
namely, inclusivism, which seeks to be friendly to many religious
stances while remaining committed to one. Although that sort of
response is in the literature generally defined by contrast with
pluralism, it is hard to make this distinction inviolable. Just as you
may skip over an article online because it&rsquo;s not your thing,
while recognizing its merits in the broader scheme of things, so you
may choose a religious community and set of religious ideas as more
suited to your own temperament and needs while allowing that others
are, objectively, equally worthy of development and defense in the
context of a broader conversation of positions. Since all need
development, why not make your own contribution here? Thus it seems
that in an important sense the inclusivist can <em>be</em> a
pluralist. In any case, inclusivism can be an example of the slightly
different thing we are presently discussing: the pluralist way of
reconciling reason and religious commitment. An inclusivist of the
sort coming into view here sticks to the specifics of her religious
tradition or form of life, hoping that without changing too much in
that package, the central features of other commitments may in time
come to be harmonized with it. So long as a grappling with what other
religious commitments have to offer in the context of one&rsquo;s own
and a true openness to change in service of theoretical integration
remain present, there is no reason to see this as being at odds with
the pluralist way.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, something rather like this conception of an
appropriately pluralist stance is already present in the work of a
fifteenth-century figure we found reason to mention in the preceding
section&mdash;Nicholas of Cusa. Ahead of his time, with a very modern
sensibility about the badness of violence and the need for conspicuous
generosity toward the most alien-seeming of alternative views,
Nicholas, a Christian, sought</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a better theoretical framework within which even all the other
religions (not only the monotheistic ones) could be integrated with
their partial perspectives on divine truth. (Riedenauer 2022: 168)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He recognized that perhaps only in the future, after various specific
religious claims had been changed or adjusted, added or lost, could
this goal be achieved, therefore counseling that in the present such
specifics be treated as preliminary or conjectural&mdash;not even
exempting Catholic theology from this concession (Riedenauer 2022:
171, 178). Nicholas apparently saw himself not just as responding to
pragmatic or religious considerations in championing his view but also
as answering to reason, which seeks, so far as possible, to bring
diversity under unity&mdash;in this case, under the ineffable and
&ldquo;utmost unity which is God&rdquo; (Riedenauer 2022: 169).</p>

<p>
Some today might object that an appropriately deep pluralism will
allow the ultimates of different religious traditions to <em>remain
plural</em> instead of seeking to reduce them to one thing, as
Nicholas appears to do. They advocate the permanent acceptability of a
distinction between, for example, personal, impersonal, and cosmic
religious ultimates (Cobb 2006). But even here there is a concern for
unity insofar as these three are thought to exist in mutual
dependence, with &ldquo;no contradiction&rdquo; between them (Cobb
2006: 70, 72). In any event, it may be observed that where the aim is
a way of making peace with reason, a bi-level, investigative pluralism
aimed at religious unity should appear attractive, if only because it
reflects a concern parallel to one central in science, which today is
often viewed as the very embodiment of reason&mdash;namely, a concern
for eventual theoretical integration and consensus. With this concern
the pluralist takes perhaps her biggest step toward a form of
religiousness &ldquo;both religiously and rationally
appealing&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="EvolWay">7. The Evolutionary Way</h2>

<p>
By taking up with evolutionary ideas, which are still most commonly
associated with biological evolution, a defense of religious
commitment might seem to be consorting with the enemy. But it is only
certain conservative forms of monotheistic religion that are obviously
damaged by Darwin&rsquo;s discoveries. Though the Darwin-inspired
disputes about evolution and religion have received a great deal of
attention, deceiving many into thinking that some general assault on
religion was in the works, we should not be thus fooled. Instead we
should remind ourselves that in addition to conservative monotheistic
religion there is non-conservative; that in addition to the
monotheistic traditions there are traditions that reject monotheism;
and that one must be mindful not only of established traditions but
also of various new religious movements (some harking back to a
religiousness that came long before the religions), not to mention all
the novel ways in which, without giving up transcendence, religious
commitment may present itself in the future. By the time we get this
far, we may be more open to the possibility that evolutionary ideas
could even provide rational aid and sustenance to religious
commitment, rather than delivering a universal debunking. It will help
if, with a similar move toward broadmindedness, we notice that not all
evolutionary ideas are Darwinian&mdash;in addition to biological
evolution there is <em>cultural</em> evolution, and also
<em>cosmological</em> evolution.</p>

<p>
The latter has figured in recent discussion. By the turn of the
twenty-first century it had become popular in certain regions of the
culture to turn awe at our complex unfolding universe into a religious
attitude, and this tendency is connected to serious academic writing
by some currents of thought visible in process philosophy and
theology, especially in &ldquo;emergentist&rdquo; forms of
panentheism, which&mdash;often inspired by the work of Alfred North
Whitehead (1929)&mdash;locate the evolving cosmos <em>within</em> a
transcendent divine reality (for examples, see Clayton &amp; Peacocke
2004, Cobb 1965, Griffin 2014, Jantzen 1998, and McFague 2001). This
sort of writing is aimed, in part, at showing how panentheistic
variations on traditional religious commitment can be in harmony with,
and even illuminated by, the most modern and up-to-the-minute
scientific thinking about the evolution of the cosmos. Thus it
represents an <em>evolutionary</em> way of seeking the reconciliation
of reason and religious commitment.</p>

<p>
Like other ways of seeking that result, this version of the
evolutionary way faces pushback from exclusively naturalistic thought,
which may be expected to find such religious elaborations of
scientific themes unnecessarily complicating. Why mar the clean
simplicity of a world regarded as everywhere natural with talk of
transcendence? If there appear to be phenomena evidently real, such as
consciousness, that fit poorly or awkwardly within an exclusively
naturalistic picture, we should be prepared to give the community of
inquiry more time to <em>make</em> them fit, perhaps by means of new
concepts, or else acknowledge that our own intellectual competence,
precisely as evolved beings within a natural world, only goes so far
(see Kitcher 2014, Nagel 2102, and McGinn 1993). One way or another,
the naturalist will say, the extravagance of an appeal to transcendent
divine realities must be avoided.</p>

<p>
Of special interest is a naturalistic rejoinder that will be regarded
as religious in contexts where religiousness is viewed as detachable
from the emphasis on transcendence (for reasons given in section 1,
the present context is not one of them). It is due to the neglected
early twentieth-century British philosopher Samuel Alexander, who
inspired Whitehead. Alexander was sensitive to facts about biological
evolution, but when thinking about God in <em>Space, Time, and
Deity</em> (1920), he had in mind a grander cosmological sort of
evolution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Within the all-embracing stuff of Space-Time, the universe exhibits an
emergence in Time of successive levels of finite existences, each with
its characteristic empirical quality. The highest of these empirical
qualities known to us is mind or consciousness. Deity is the next
higher empirical quality to the highest we know. (Alexander 1920:
345)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But deity is not God. Rather, for Alexander, deity is a quality
possessed by God. And nor is deity just the &ldquo;next higher
empirical quality to the highest we know&rdquo;. Deity is a quality
newly configured at <em>each</em> new and higher level in the
continual forward motion from materiality to life to consciousness and
so on of a universe with a nisus&mdash;that is, an impulse or
drive&mdash;toward deity. And God? &ldquo;God is the whole world as
possessing the quality of deity&rdquo; (1920: 353). Though Alexander
appears to think of God in more than one way, God <em>thus</em>
conceived is apparently Space-Time as a whole when regarded as
possessing the tendency to proceed through stages of progressive
evolutionary change. This God can be said to be &ldquo;in process
towards&rdquo; future qualities of deity (1920: 394). And the
religious life? &ldquo;[I]t is religion to do our duty with the
consciousness of helping to create [God&rsquo;s] deity&rdquo; (1920:
299). In other words, through progressive work in the various
departments of human life we may see ourselves as aiding in the next
stage of the evolution of God.</p>

<p>
Alexander&rsquo;s view is unique. Its conceptual core is not
pantheism, since deity on this view is not equally in every part of
the universe, and it is not panentheism, since Alexander is a
naturalist who finds nothing divine beyond the universe. It is not
theism&mdash;though sometimes, and misleadingly, it is called emergent
theism&mdash;because it is not clear that the imagined infinitely
progressive universe will produce anything like what we today have in
mind when we think of a powerful supernatural agent; certainly there
will be none that exists from the beginning and is its source. There
is, remarkably, no common category in which to place this view. My
reason for introducing it here is twofold: that it has been neglected,
and that it shows how naturalism can mount its <em>own</em> forms of
emergentism, which may when fully considered seem grand enough to
function as rivals to the emergentism of a transcendence-involving
panentheism (Thomas 2016). Thus the naturalist has more than one move
to try in resisting our first example of the evolutionary way. If the
Alexandrian move remains in the end unsatisfying for the religiously
inclined, it will be because moves like the panentheist&rsquo;s have
succeeded in convincing them that something more than a natural,
empirical reality is needed to engage and satisfy us in the religious
realm.</p>

<p>
What a naturalistic emergentism like Alexander&rsquo;s suggests,
beyond what was stressed in the foregoing, is that along with every
other evolutionary emphasis, we should be open to an emphasis on the
evolution of <em>religion</em>. A second version of the evolutionary
way develops precisely this emphasis: it applies evolutionary thinking
to religion. But it does so in a manner that, so it says, gives new
life to the transcendent hopes that our first version of the
evolutionary way is also unwilling to relinquish, even in the face of
options as interesting as Alexander&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
Here again it is not just biological evolution that is in
view&mdash;though references to the geological timescale undergirding
Darwinian thought are plentiful. Instead <em>cultural</em> evolution
looms large. Less well understood than its biological cousin, cultural
evolution has been receiving a growing share of attention recently
(for relevant examples, see Buchanan &amp; Powell 2018, Creanza et al.
2017, Lewens 2015, and Richerson &amp; Boyd 2005). Like any evolution,
cultural evolution is just a form of change, but most would allow that
sometimes, in fits and starts, cultural change is developmental,
resulting in some improvement to our life together. And it is this
developmental aspect of cultural change that is exploited by our
second evolutionary option, which invites us to think about it at the
macroscale or species level. Our species, so it tells us, is still at
an early stage of its life on our planet. Quite obviously, the stage
we have reached is early in a purely temporal sense. <em>Homo
sapiens</em> is now about 300,000 years old. It would take another
200,000 years&mdash;one hundred times the length of the period
separating us from Jesus of Nazareth&mdash;to get us just halfway to
the average lifespan of mammal species on our planet. But our stage is
also early developmentally, as measured by various aspirations
cultural evolution has made salient&mdash;for example, the aspiration
to overcome our violent tendencies. Judged against large cultural
ambitions, our record of performance leaves a good deal to be desired.
In relation to the exploration of transcendent possibilities in
particular, such things as dogmatism, sexism, violence, and inadequate
investigation have conspired to hold us back.</p>

<p>
So what can be done on behalf of a transcendence-oriented religious
commitment with this idea of an early stage of human development,
should we accept it? Well, since we are still at an early stage of
human development, reason will instruct us to behave accordingly. In
particular, we should be thinking about religion in a manner that is
tailored precisely to such early-stage conditions. In other words, we
have hit on a form of religious relativism, one that bids us judge
whether anything religious is rationally appropriate in a manner that
is relative to or dependent on how humans are situated at an early
stage. We could therefore try to make religious commitment as
understood in this entry, with its old transcendence-oriented core,
rationally unproblematic by devising new forms of
transcendence-involving religion&mdash;or revising old ones&mdash;in
such a way as to meet the stage-relativist standard. And this, our new
approach suggests, it will not be hard to do (Schellenberg 2013,
2019).</p>

<p>
Call this approach to the reconciliation of reason and religious
commitment <em>early-stage religious relativism</em>. The claim of
early-stage religious relativism, as noted, is not just that it can
yield a religious result pleasing to reason but also that it will be
easier to do this in the relativist way than to defend religious
commitment within an unrelativized frame of reference. After all,
something less than belief, that is, some suitable non-doxastic
attitude, will likely be part of a relativized religious
commitment&mdash;it is too early in the relevant processes of human
development for the confidence of religious belief&mdash;and
nondoxastic religious attitudes are easier to defend than believing
ones. Likewise, something other than a detailed notion of religious
transcendence will likely be of primary importance at the present
stage&mdash;it is too early for confident thought about religious
details&mdash;and general conceptualizations are easier to defend than
specific ones. Moreover, now it is not hard to see how the religious
might defend a continuing emphasis on transcendence. Indeed, we are
now encouraged to retain an emphasis on transcendence in religion,
precisely because we have so much further to go in the project of
spelling out its possible articulations. By thinking in the relativist
way, therefore, even if not otherwise, so says our second version of
the evolutionary way, we will find that reason and religious
commitment can be reconciled.</p>

<p>
There has been debate about what sort of nonbelieving religious
attitude, if any, might fit an undeveloped stage of human development
(Palmqvist 2019a, Schellenberg 2019). There has also been debate about
what religious propositional content, if any, is appropriate to such
an early stage. Should it be <em>ultimism</em>&mdash;the view that
there is a metaphysically, axiologically, and soteriologically
ultimate reality (Schellenberg 2009)? Perhaps ultimism, though quite
spare, still claims too much and should be replaced by the Dutch
notion of &ldquo;ietsism&rdquo;, which says only that there is
<em>something</em> religiously transcendent (Elliott 2017)? Should we
instead accept some suitably modified <em>traditional</em> religious
account, because it offers the best chance of salvific religious
experience (Palmqvist 2019b)? Perhaps, on the other hand, to have a
truly evolutionary approach to religion we ought to reject the
transcendent hopes allowed by early-stage religious relativism,
endorsing instead a purely <em>naturalistic</em> evolutionary ontology
(Rottschaefer 2016)?</p>

<p>
Only the latter, naturalistic view threatens the ability of the new
religious relativism to reconfigure discussion in a manner that is
transcendence-friendly. In response, the early-stage relativist, as
one might expect, will be inclined to say that it is too early for an
intellectual commitment to naturalism! Given various shortcomings that
have hampered our development in this regard, much serious religious
investigation remains to be undertaken&mdash;<em>too</em> much for a
naturalistic commitment, which is committed to the notion that no
transcendent possibility will ever be realized, to be other than
premature (Schellenberg 2009). The most intellectually optimistic
naturalists, confident in the power of science, will of course
disagree, thinking that the falsehood of all religious claims, known
and unknown, can already be inferred. And they may moreover criticize
as excessively skeptical the early-stage approach, finding
unsatisfactory the reply that a great deal may be learned in the early
grades at school though many additional years of learning lie ahead.
Even the less confident naturalist may wonder why naturalism itself
might not be a position worth developing and defending at an early
stage of human development if embraced non-doxastically. Perhaps
reason will be happy to accept such work from those without much in
the way of a religious sensibility, even if it is also prepared to
sanction the efforts of the early-stage religious relativist.</p>

<p>
As we conclude this discussion of the six ways, it is important to
note that many other versions of each of them (and indeed other ways)
may be turned up by future investigation. As for these six: it may be
useful, once again, to notice how&mdash;with the new ways of sections
5, 6, and 7 now brought into the mix&mdash;they might be thought to
work well together, even if their independent powers appear subject to
doubt. The limited ineffabilist thesis, if initially it seems rather
austere, may appear less so (or less objectionably so) if taken on
board in an evolutionary frame of mind and regarded as appropriate to
an early stage of species-level development, with plenty of realistic
hopes remaining for a later realization of consensus and convergence
on at any rate some of the details of the divine, as described by our
second version of the pluralist way. At the same time, the modesty we
might learn to regard as appropriate to an early stage of development,
which will no doubt strike some as delivering only a thin and
impoverished form of religious commitment, can be enriched by the
thought of incorporating an ineffabilist spirituality or engaging
wholeheartedly in the pluralist project&mdash;perhaps by mobilizing
ideas of cosmic evolution like those animating an emergentist
panentheism. It is also realistic, and furthermore religiously
encouraging, if we have as much time to work with as the early-stage
relativist reminds us is available within an evolutionary frame of
reference, to suppose that the more compelling testimony or widespread
religious experience or effective argument imagined at the end of
section 4 <em>might</em> eventually come to be. If such possibilities
are realized, human beings in the far future will enjoy
transcendence-oriented religious commitments with rational qualities
quite unlike any that can be made available today.</p>
