<p>
Plotinus&rsquo; philosophy represents one of the supreme intellectual
achievements of the period that has come to be called &ldquo;Late
Antiquity&rdquo;. Plotinus is generally regarded as the founder of
Late Antique Platonism, sometimes termed &ldquo;Neoplatonism&rdquo;, a
school of thought that, while claiming to be the inheritor of the long
tradition of ancient Greek rationalism rooted in the period of
Presocratic philosophy, is also foreshadowing some of the cultural
developments that would take place in the following centuries, chiefly
over the periods of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Based
primarily on what are regarded as the fundamental principles of
Platonic philosophy, it continues the optimistic and systematic
version of philosophy represented by the various schools of the
Hellenistic and Greco-Roman periods, though it also exhibits some of
the uncertainties and ambivalences informing the unquestionably darker
and less self-assured worldview that became prevalent during
Plotinus&rsquo;s own lifetime. In this way, although Plotinus
maintains a distinctly traditional outlook, he prefigures the advent
of a new era of intellectual accomplishments, and that is why today,
although he sometimes appears unduly attached to tradition, his views
and sensitivities also strike us as astonishingly innovative or even
modern.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWrit">1. Life and Writings</h2>

<p>
Thanks to Porphyry&rsquo;s editorial solicitude, we possess almost the
entirety of Plotinus&rsquo; oeuvre, grouped thematically into the
<em>Enneads</em>, thus dubbed on account of their peculiar symmetric
arrangement into six parts, each of which contains nine
 treatises.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 By arranging his teacher&rsquo;s works into the arithmetical schema
of the <em>Enneads</em>, Porphyry attempted to order them in
accordance with their content. This represents an approach that
engages first with the more &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; and
&ldquo;simple&rdquo;, in terms of their themes, treatments of
questions of moral and anthropological nature (in <em>Ennead</em> I),
moving on to issues pertaining to the sensible world and the basic
principles that govern its functioning (in <em>Enneads</em> II and
III), and then proceeding to the more elusive and complex problems
concerning the three supra-sensible so-called &ldquo;hypostases&rdquo;
of his system, namely the soul (in <em>Ennead</em> IV), the Intellect
(in <em>Enneads</em> V and VI) and the One (in <em>Ennead</em> VI),
where Plotinus introduces and analyzes in detail the higher principles
on the basis of which the entire sensible reality is produced and
articulated. It is unclear, however, whether this approach is indeed
helpful to readers, who are right from the start confronted with some
of the most intractable and demanding of Plotinus&rsquo; treatises. In
general, Porphyry&rsquo;s arrangement has been repeatedly criticized
in the past as utterly artificial and arbitrary, echoing more the
editor&rsquo;s views than those of Plotinus.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, thanks to Porphyry again, we possess a complete
chronological table recording in detail the order of composition of
each of the treatises that were subsequently incorporated into the
<em>Enneads</em> (<em>VP</em> 4.22&ndash;6.25). Some of the more
recent editors have in fact opted to follow this order, having
entirely given up on the effort of organizing the relevant material on
the basis of its various themes. Despite the advantages of this
approach, the fact remains that the chronological arrangement of
Plotinus&rsquo; works rarely helps readers form a complete and precise
picture of his philosophy. For although we can arguably discern some
signs of development in his thought regarding specific issues (see,
e.g., Meijer 1992: 27&ndash;52), it appears fairly cohesive as a whole
and stable in its pivotal points. Any changes pertain chiefly to the
manner in which he formulates his meanings, or perhaps to his more
dedicated focus on certain subjects, without substantial deviations in
terms of philosophical content and implications. Thus, for example, in
his early works Plotinus tends to rely somewhat more extensively on a
doxographical type of analysis of earlier approaches to the question
at hand, but this is certainly no reason to regard these works as more
introductory or more readily accessible to readers. Furthermore,
throughout his authorial <em>cursus</em> he often revisits the same
themes over and over again, each time approaching them from a slightly
different perspective. In these cases, it is certainly preferable to
have before us all the treatises dedicated to connected issues or with
complementary content. Furthermore, Plotinus began composing his works
approximately in the last sixteen years of his life, which means he
started when he was already at the mature age of fifty. In light of
this, it appears unlikely that in this period of time his
philosophical views changed or evolved significantly, especially since
he regarded his philosophy as something complete and given from the
outset&mdash;with Plato having already furnished its fundamentals,
albeit in a manner that required concerted effort so as to properly
interpret and present it with the completeness it deserves.</p>

<p>
Thanks to the introductory text, the <em>Vita Plotini</em>
(<em>VP</em>), with which Porphyry prefaces his edition, we can also
avail ourselves of a sufficiently reliable account of Plotinus&rsquo;
life and milieu. It includes information on the way in which he taught
and composed his works, and also on how these were received by his
contemporaries. Overall, Porphyry&rsquo;s first-hand account
constitutes an invaluable testimony on the way of life of one of the
preeminent thinkers of antiquity, while it also provides precious
information about one of the less well-known periods of the Roman era,
which is often, and not without good reason, described as the
&ldquo;Third Century Crisis&rdquo;. Porphyry was a student of Plotinus
and lived with him for a period of roughly five years. We learn from
his account that his master was a native of Egypt (we may infer that
he was born in 204 CE); that he came to attend the lectures of the
elusive but evidently influential Ammonius Saccas in Alexandria at the
age of 28 and that he stayed with his teacher for the next eleven
years, until he decided to follow the infelicitous expedition emperor
Gordian III launched against Persia in 243. We are told that he did so
because he aspired to become &ldquo;acquainted with the wisdom of the
Persians and the Indians&rdquo;. After the expedition was aborted when
Gordian was murdered by his troops, Plotinus moved to Rome, where he
appears to have had some important social connections, and settled
permanently there late in 244, teaching continuously for more than
twenty-five years, until his death in 270. He offered what appears to
be a fairly organized series of lectures that were open to the public
and regularly attended by a group of trusted pupils, well-versed in
the master&rsquo;s distinctive approach and manner of exposition.</p>

<p>
His written works, which vary in length from a single page to over a
hundred, were firmly bound up with the activities of the
&ldquo;school&rdquo; in which he taught, as they echo the manner of
presenting and analyzing the various questions treated in that
environment (see <em>VP</em> 4.9&ndash;14). Plotinus&rsquo;
&ldquo;treatises&rdquo; began to be composed ten years after his
arrival in Rome and they aimed mainly at recording the discussions
that took place in the classroom, functioning as
&ldquo;reminders&rdquo; (<em>hupomn&#275;mata</em>) for those who
participated in the &ldquo;meetings&rdquo; (<em>sunousiai</em>)
(<em>VP</em> 13.15&ndash;7). Porphyry describes how these meetings
unfolded, and his testimony is rather enlightening on this point, as
it also offers us important insights into how Plotinus&rsquo; works
were composed. </p>

<p>
As he recounts, the <em>sunousiai</em> usually commenced by reading
out loud substantial passages from available treatises or commentaries
on the works of Plato and Aristotle composed by various roughly
contemporary scholars; then, the master extensively discussed with
those present the &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; (<em>aporiai</em>) of the
subject treated in these passages. Finally, Plotinus would outline his
own, often rather astute, analysis of the matter at hand and
subsequently announced the end of the meeting (<em>VP</em>
14.10&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
It is easy to identify traces of this method of addressing
philosophical questions in Plotinus&rsquo; works, and it is evident
that these works were primarily addressed to a rather limited circle
of students, those described as &ldquo;auditors&rdquo;
(<em>akroatai</em>) or companions. These were already accustomed to
their teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;usual manner of expressing himself&rdquo;
(<em>VP</em> 20.7) but also well-versed in the works contained in the
&ldquo;reading list&rdquo;, which were discussed during these
meetings. It is obvious that Plotinus&rsquo;s readers were expected to
be well acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle, so as to be
able to readily identify his frequent references, or even mere
allusions, to them. We can rather easily recognize these
&ldquo;primary&rdquo; sources today. It is a much more arduous task to
track down and highlight references to the &ldquo;secondary
bibliography&rdquo;, by which I mean the exegetical works mentioned
earlier which were one of Plotinus&rsquo; key instruments when
teaching. Although these works undoubtedly played a significant role
in shaping Plotinus&rsquo;s thought&mdash;and are therefore important
for any attempt at understanding it&mdash;it is nonetheless almost
impossible to accurately gauge their contribution beyond the general
remarks provided by Porphyry, as most are nowadays nonextant and thus
largely obscure to us. Things are further complicated by
Plotinus&rsquo;s habit of never mentioning by name sources that were
chronologically closer to him. In this he differs radically from his
pupil, Porphyry, who, after having studied grammar and rhetoric in
Athens, was accustomed to meticulously quoting the works he employed
in his writings; in fact, this earned him the&mdash;rather
derogatory&mdash;sobriquet &ldquo;much-learned&rdquo;
(<em>polumath&#275;s</em>). In contrast, Plotinus almost never reveals
the sources he is drawing on, although, as Porphyry informs us,
&ldquo;his writings are full of concealed Stoic and Peripatetic
doctrines: Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>, in particular, is
concentrated in them&rdquo; (<em>VP</em> 14.4&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
This lack of references constitutes one of the main sources of the
difficulties modern readers face when engaging with the
<em>Enneads</em>. Yet there are further challenges which are due to
the peculiar manner in which Plotinus often chooses to express his
thoughts. Porphyry&rsquo;s testimony proves once again instrumental.
For he describes in rather vivid detail how his teacher composed his
treatises (<em>VP</em> 8.1&ndash;19). He thus makes it possible for us
to understand the reasons why Plotinus&rsquo; authorial style often
exhibits an associative structure, with frequent repetitions and
labyrinthine interconnections, where we sometimes have the feeling of
witnessing the oral expression of an internal monologue or even a live
dialogue with an unnamed interlocutor, evidently without any sustained
effort having gone into systematically revising or arranging the
relevant material.</p>

<p>
This, however, in no way implies that Plotinus&rsquo;s thought is
itself unsystematic. The reader readily perceives that the array of
philosophical thoughts conveyed in these works aims to provide a fully
organized and minutely arranged, comprehensive conception of reality,
with each individual treatise attempting to reveal a particular facet
of it that is&mdash;or seeks to be&mdash;harmoniously ordered in a
larger overarching synthesis. Plato&rsquo;s philosophy is central to
this systematic project, and it too is treated as a complete
philosophical system, but one that can be readily developed, expanded,
supplemented, and even corrected and adapted in certain minor
respects, to meet the new philosophical challenges of Plotinus&rsquo;
time. At any rate, Plato&rsquo;s figure dominates Plotinus&rsquo;
thought, constituting the key source of inspiration for the worldview
of the founder of what in modern times has come to be called
&ldquo;Neoplatonism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Concurrently, however, we should not underplay the very substantial
contribution of Aristotelian philosophy, which, as also noted by
Porphyry, is ever present in Plotinus&rsquo; treatises. Plotinus
constantly applies himself to providing responses to the objections
raised by Aristotle vis-&agrave;-vis Plato&rsquo;s philosophy, and
simultaneously makes systematic efforts to incorporate some of
Aristotle&rsquo;s basic conclusions into the broader edifice of
Platonism, as Plotinus understood it; Aristotelianism is a fundamental
component in how he elaborated and presented his philosophical
questions. Sometimes, this makes his exposition appear like a detailed
and comprehensive dialogue with Aristotle as well as with some of his
chief interpreters. Thus the need to grapple with the developments in
the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle&mdash;but also to engage
with the Stoics and other less well-known philosophical currents, such
as Neopythagoreanism and Gnosticism&mdash;shapes Plotinus&rsquo;s
thought, even though this is not immediately clear when we first
engage with his works (see, e.g., Chiaradonna 2002, Graeser 1972,
Gertz 2022). Furthermore, by reading side by side thematically
interrelated passages dispersed throughout the <em>Enneads</em> we can
reconstruct the path Plotinus followed in developing his philosophy
and gain awareness of the manner in which each of his theoretical
tenets contributes to the overall system. </p>

<p>
However, despite the systematic aspirations of his endeavor as a
whole, it remains most challenging for his readers to discern a
specific path they are called on to follow in reading his treatises so
as to navigate them in a way that is sufficiently consonant with its
internal structure. In what follows, I freely treat ideas encountered
in different sections of the <em>Enneads</em> as forming parts of a
fairly coherent systematic edifice displaying remarkable consistency
of thought and of general theoretical outlook.</p>

<h2 id="NatuSensBodi">2. The Nature of Sensible Bodies</h2>

<p>
The analysis of sensible reality attempted by Plotinus exhibits, at
first glance, important analogies as well as substantial differences
from the one we find in the works of Aristotle. In a word, Aristotle
takes a hylomorphic model as its basis. According to this model, each
individual body is comprised of two constituents, a material and a
formal one, with both always forming a unity, and without any of the
two being capable of existing independently of the other. For
Plotinus, however, their individual combinations are subject to
endless alternation, resulting in the continuous fluidity of the
phenomena observed in the sensible realm (III 6.6.76&ndash;77). In his
view, the material constituent of bodies is &ldquo;matter&rdquo;
(<em>hul&#275;</em>) conceived of as the permanent substrate of all
the changes occurring on the level of sensible reality.
Plotinus&rsquo;s matter differs from Aristotle&rsquo;s because, in
contrast to it, it is not that earlier stage of reality from which
(<em>ex hou</em>) a body comes to be in virtue of a form through the
occurrence of certain changes. For Plotinus it never actually receives
a form but, on the contrary, it constitutes a stable and utterly inert
substrate in which (<em>en h&#333;i</em>) sensible forms become
manifest (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.17.27). In other words, sensible forms,
for Plotinus, determine the identity and characteristics of each
material thing, without the substrate itself incurring any real
shaping or change. In itself, matter completely lacks qualitative or
quantitative characteristics, such as size and extension (&Iota;&Iota;
4.14.20&ndash;30; see Hutchinson 2022: 305&ndash;7). It is simply
predisposed to afford extension to whatever it takes on (&Iota;&Iota;
4.11.17&ndash;19), thus enabling those formal components, whose
coexistence elicits the impression of a particular body extended in
space, to appear on it. Since matter is never endowed with any
qualities or quantities, as it is the substrate that merely renders
their appearance possible, it is characterized by Plotinus as
&ldquo;non-being&rdquo; (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.6.29&ndash;32,
7.1&ndash;12), in the sense that it possesses none of the qualitative
and quantitative characteristics that would impart on it a particular
identity (&Iota;&Iota; 5.5.6&ndash;13). This complete absence of
qualities makes it receptive to any form that is projected on it,
since matter, by remaining totally unaffected, does not put up any
resistance and thus functions like an utterly impassible mirror, on
which a variety of forms appear without ever truly shaping it; matter
is incapable of acquiring any of these and making it truly its own
(&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.18.29&ndash;41).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the formal component of sensible bodies, which
imparts on them a specific identity making each what it is, is not, as
Aristotle would put it, a simple eidetic shape, a form
(<em>eidos</em>), but what Plotinus calls a &ldquo;formative
principle&rdquo; (<em>logos</em>) (&Iota;&Iota; 6.2.15&ndash;19,
&Iota;&Iota; 7.3.6&ndash;14). This <em>logos</em> is each time a
combination of formal characteristics, whose coexistence bestows on
each individual body its identity and, in that sense, could be
described&mdash;in Aristotelian terms&mdash;as its
&ldquo;essence&rdquo;, that is, as what something is primarily, which
also corresponds to its definition. Thus, for example, a particular
instance of fire will possess, among others, the qualitative
characteristics of being hot, dry and moving upwards, which
differentiate it from other elements. In other words, it is the
formative principle that determines each body for what it is, and that
differentiates it from, and associates it with, other bodies within
the sensible world (VI 3.15.27&ndash;38; see Kalligas 2011:
771&ndash;77 and cf. Chiaradonna 2016: 43&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
At the same time, each individual body, whose identity has been
determined in this manner by the corresponding formative principle, is
capable of taking on additional qualitative, quantitative or other
characteristics; these will determine it further without, however,
altering its fundamental character as the thing it is (VI
3.8.23&ndash;30, 10.7&ndash;20), i.e., without depriving it of its
identity or, in other words, its quasi-essence. Hence, the fundamental
distinction introduced by Aristotle between the primary or
&ldquo;first&rdquo; substance and the other categories that exist in
it as &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; qualities, predicated of it as &ldquo;in
a subject&rdquo;, is retained by Plotinus. Plotinus, however, does not
assign to this &ldquo;substance&rdquo; the key role it performs in the
Stagirite&rsquo;s philosophy, insofar as a substance, for him, is a,
more or less, contingent synthesis of qualitative (and possibly
quantitative) characteristics (which correspond to the specific
formative <em>logos</em>) and matter (VI 3.8.16&ndash;27,
9.27&ndash;36; cf. D&rsquo;Ancona 1997: 377&ndash;82).</p>

<p>
But there is another point on which Plotinus differs from Aristotle in
his analysis of bodies. For Plotinus the qualitative (and possibly
other) characteristics, which convey on any given body the properties
that we, through our senses, recognize and perceive as inherent to it,
do not constitute real entities possessing a self-subsistent identity,
but are mere images or likenesses of the true intelligible beings
(&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.7.23&ndash;42). The latter are intelligible, and
consequently supra-sensible Forms, and participation in these causes
the occurrence of the corresponding &ldquo;phenomenalities&rdquo; on
matter and thus the formation of the sensible images that we perceive
as present in it (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.11.1&ndash;8; see
D&rsquo;Ancona 1997: 393&ndash;7). The formative principle acts as an
intermediary: it projects (temporarily and incidentally) on the level
of phenomenality (i.e., the sensible world) a reality that is
established on the level of intelligible beings or of intelligible
Essence, and it thereby organizes what appears within it on the basis
of principles and specifications that are determined by that
Essence.</p>

<p>
For this formative process to take place, there needs to be the
mediation of an additional active causal factor, which will project
these sensible reflections from the realm of intelligible entities
onto that of sensible things. This is none other than the soul, which
is an utterly independent and self-subsistent entity that, by its very
constitution, is capable of accessing both realms. The soul is in
charge of enabling the formative principles to project forms onto the
sensible world. The activity by which the soul carries out its task of
transmitting the reflections of the intelligible Forms to the sensible
world is called &ldquo;contemplation&rdquo; (<em>the&#333;ria</em>).
As will become clear in
 <a href="#HypoInte">section 6</a>,
 this mode of transmission is part of a broader tendency inherent in
Plotinus&rsquo; ontological system, where the &ldquo;higher&rdquo;
entities become manifest in the &ldquo;lower&rdquo; levels in the
guise of &ldquo;images&rdquo; or &ldquo;traces&rdquo;. Through
<em>the&#333;ria</em>, the soul is directed to the intelligible Forms
and apprehends their representations. Having developed and processed
the content of these representations in accordance with its own
cognitive abilities, the soul, so to say, transmits the information
coming from the intelligible realm to the sensible world by shaping
the latter in the image of the former in a manner that corresponds to
its own peculiar mode of contemplation (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota;
8.4.1&ndash;22). Hence, we could claim that the formative role played
in Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy by &ldquo;enmattered form&rdquo;
(<em>enhulon eidos</em>) in the formation of bodies is fulfilled,
according to Plotinus, by the (&ldquo;secondary&rdquo;, as will be
described further on) activity of the soul. This is because the soul
itself, having contemplated the eidetic models of sensible things,
i.e., the forms, can accordingly produce the characteristics of the
<em>logoi</em> in their role as formative principles of sensible
things (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 2.2.16&ndash;42, &Iota;&Iota;&Iota;
8.4.15&ndash;31).</p>

<p>
Insofar as a body is animated by an individual soul, its soul will be
in charge of shaping and arranging it. In the case of bodies that lack
an individual soul, they will be shaped by what Plotinus calls
&ldquo;Nature&rdquo;, a causal principle originating from the cosmic
Soul, which, through its Providence, rules over the entirety of the
sensible universe and it organizes it into a coherent and harmonious
whole. This whole is governed by forces and interactions securing its
proper functioning as a complete, self-sustained and self-powered
organism, albeit one that is unconscious of its actions, as it merely
conforms, involuntarily and almost automatically, to the instructions
resulting from the contemplation in which the cosmic Soul is engaged
(&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 8.5.1&ndash;29).</p>

<p>
We should note here that the apparent shaping of matter through the
action of the qualitative characteristics that are projected on it
either by a specific formative principle or, alternatively, by the
activity of individual souls is carried out gradually over successive
phases. These phases render the substrate receptive to a further
stratum of characteristics that specify the properties that will
appear on a particular body. Thus, for example, the originally
shapeless &ldquo;earth&rdquo; formed by the fundamental properties of
the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and the &ldquo;dry&rdquo;, may become a
definite quantity of a certain material, such as, e.g.,
<em>psimuthion</em> (&ldquo;white lead&rdquo;, a powder employed as a
cosmetic throughout antiquity), which possesses the further
characteristic properties of whiteness and toxicity (&Iota;&Iota;
6.1.16&ndash;31). This layered formative process enables the gradual
emergence of very complex kinds of corporeality, and it gives rise to
the almost inexhaustible variety of perceptible shapes observed in the
universe, even prior to the appearance of any kind of living organism
in it (V 8.7.16&ndash;24).</p>

<p>
A characteristic feature of bodies is their extension and
divisibility. And insofar as the division of any body leads to the
formation of two or more smaller bodies, for Plotinus the process of
subdivision can continue in perpetuity, without some definitively
indivisible bodily component ever emerging (IV 2.1.11&ndash;17).
Moreover, Plotinus argues that any body can be arrayed next to other
bodies or intermingled with them in various ways while retaining its
basic properties, at least in potentiality, and it may instantaneously
recover these once it becomes separated from them (&Iota;&Iota;
7.2.22&ndash;42). These properties continue to characterize it and are
not diffused in its environment except by undergoing specific
predetermined processes that are governed by the natural laws, that
is, by the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; with which the cosmic Soul
regulates interactions between the different bodies through relations
of &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; and &ldquo;disaffinity&rdquo; that link
bodies to one another (IV 4.32.7&ndash;25).</p>

<p>
The sum total of these laws, which remain constant and immutable as a
consequence of the stability of the cosmic Soul&rsquo;s contemplation
of intelligible Forms, is sometimes described as Nature or even as
Destiny (<em>heimarmen&#275;</em>) (III 1.10.1&ndash;10). It extends
along the full expanse of the universe and ensures its eternal
duration (&Iota;&Iota; 1.3.1&ndash;23). Destiny is a network of
deterministic rules that operate almost automatically and
unintentionally, responding to a kind of &ldquo;hypothetical
necessity&rdquo;, where the same causes inexorably produce the same
effects, provided that no other exogenous factor enters into play. The
network of all these laws orderly regulates all changes occurring
within the sensible universe, and it predetermines the behavior of
bodies in it in a manner that is consistent and predictable, so long
as no additional causal factors intrude (II 3.13.3&ndash;45).</p>

<p>
But apart from the inanimate bodies, the sensible realm also includes
a great number of living organisms that are distributed in it in
accordance with the material constitution of the bodies they possess
(&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 2.3.23&ndash;30). The life of these organisms is
governed and regulated not only by the fundamental inexorable laws of
universal Nature but also by the individual souls, which coexist and
cooperate with the cosmic Soul and jointly shape the universe (VI
7.7.8&ndash;16; see Tornau 2016: 140&ndash;52). These souls are
kindred and homologous to the cosmic Soul, which governs the universe
as a whole (IV 3.2.54&ndash;58, 6.1&ndash;15), but they focus their
activity on animating and managing individual bodies. The kinship
linking them to one another enables souls to communicate and interact,
even without the intervention of their corresponding bodies (IV
9.3.1&ndash;9), and at the same time it makes them coordinate and
harmonize their activity so as to bring about a unitary, although not
free of contrarieties and antagonism, harmonious whole (IV
8.5.1&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
As will be shown below in
 <a href="#HypoSoul">section 4</a>,
 these individual souls do not actually descend nor do they inhabit
the bodies that they animate, but merely project upon them an image of
themselves, which imparts on bodies a semblance of vital functions and
leads to the formation of what is called the &ldquo;living
organism&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;living being&rdquo;
(<em>z&#333;ion</em>) (see I 1.7.1&ndash;6, III 4.3.24&ndash;27, III
9.3.1&ndash;4, IV 3.26.1&ndash;9, IV 4.18.7, IV 8.8.1&ndash;3, VI
4.16.14&ndash;17, VI 7.5.21&ndash;30, and Igal 1979: 330&ndash;40;
Caluori 2022: 233&ndash;5). The life enjoyed by this organism and all
its constituting parts is not real, but a mere effulgence of real
life, which is the soul&rsquo;s primary activity. The souls remain
&ldquo;undescended&rdquo; and untouched by corporeality, supervising
the various functions and affections of the organic body, so to speak,
&ldquo;from above&rdquo; (IV 3.12.1&ndash;8, IV 8.5.24&ndash;6.10, VI
4.6.9&ndash;19), without ever becoming directly involved into what the
body incurs as a consequence of its interaction with other bodies in
the world. It is only a soul&rsquo;s engagement with, and solicitude
for, the particular body that can, if it grows excessive, cause it to
become emotionally entangled with the body and end up participating in
what befalls it, in the form of pleasure or distress and pain, as well
as of the other affections associated with corporeal life (II
9.2.4&ndash;10, III 2.7.15&ndash;28, IV 3.6.25&ndash;27, V
1.1.9&ndash;19.). On the contrary, the &ldquo;living being&rdquo; is
the true subject of the so-called psychic affections, which the soul
apprehends cognitively, without itself suffering anything (&Iota;
1.2.9&ndash;11, &Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.1.28&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
The individual soul&rsquo;s activity animates the organism as a whole
in such a manner as to ensure interaction between its parts. Anything
that happens to one part impacts all the other parts, and as a result
the whole behaves and reacts as an organized unity that, in this way,
appears to be pervaded by an internal &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; and
possessed of a kind of precursory &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; (III
6.4.18&ndash;23, IV 4.35.1&ndash;21; see Tornau 2016: 140&ndash;52).
Correspondingly, on the cosmic level, the natural laws ensure the
interaction between the parts of the universe even when these are not
in direct physical contact with one another, thereby producing the
network of sympathetic &ldquo;magical&rdquo; interactions that
permeate Nature through and through (IV 4.32.10&ndash;25,
37.11&ndash;25, 40.1&ndash;14). These interactions, as we have pointed
out, manifest themselves automatically and involuntarily, not
requiring any conscious intervention or effort on the part of the
cosmic Soul (III 4.4.2&ndash;13, IV 8.2.6&ndash;24). The nature of the
activities that determine these bonds can be described, on account of
the mutual attraction they exercise, as &ldquo;erotic&rdquo;, in the
sense that they echo the presence of cosmic Love as the cohesive power
of the universe (IV 4.40.1&ndash;12; cf. Hadot 1982: 286&ndash;9). In
this way, the entirety of the sensible world is constituted into a
unitary universe, which is held together by internal necessity and
harmony, while it moves in a circle governed by the Soul that rules
over it, which in turn ceaselessly imitates the self-thinking motion
of the divine Intellect (II 2.1.1&ndash;19, 2.5&ndash;15, III
2.3.29&ndash;31, VI 4.2.34&ndash;49, VI 9.8.1&ndash;8; cf. Wilberding
2006: 63&ndash;8). Interactions between the parts of the sensible
world are governed by stable laws; in turn, these echo the
mathematical constitution of the cosmic Soul, resulting in a beautiful
and harmoniously arranged whole, which corresponds, so far as this is
possible, to the sublime beauty of the model on the basis of which it
has been constituted (V 8.3.1&ndash;10, 8.1&ndash;7; see Armstrong
1975: 156&ndash;60). Thus it is made clear that the organization and
arrangement of the universe are expressions of cosmic Providence,
through which the higher principles manifest themselves in the realm
of sensible realities and determine the unfolding of phenomena on the
basis of an overall regulatory framework&mdash;the rational order of
the cosmos (&Iota;&Iota; 3.13.34&ndash;38, &Iota;&Iota;&Iota;
2.11.6&ndash;16). The movements of the heavenly bodies as well as the
interplay between them and their interactions with earthly phenomena
also submit to this rational order; at any rate, they cannot transcend
the level of unintentional and unconscious Destiny
(<em>heimarmen&#275;</em>) (II 3.14.2&ndash;21).</p>

<h2 id="FirsDigrPresSuprSensHypoSensDoma">3. First Digression: The presence of the supra-sensible hypostases in the sensible domain</h2>

<p>
Plotinus takes for granted the fundamental Platonic distinction
between two levels of reality, an intelligible and a perceptible one
(see III 7.1.1&ndash;3, VI 2.1.16&ndash;33, VI 4.2.1&ndash;3).
Investigating the relation binding together these two levels is
instrumental to understanding the explanatory role supra-sensible
entities are called on to play with respect to what appears in the
sensible realm.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;participation&rdquo; (<em>methexis</em>) of sensible things
in the intelligible realities (these also include the souls) does not
occur through the &ldquo;extension&rdquo; of the latter into the space
occupied by the former (VI 4.2.17&ndash;34). For, <em>qua</em>
incorporeal entities, intelligible beings can in no wise become
extended in space, whose existence, in any case, depends on the
presence of perceptible bodies (II 4.12.11&ndash;12). The omnipresence
of intelligible entities consists in the fact that, jointly, they
constitute a unitary, self-sufficient totality, with parts that are
fully and mutually interrelated (VI 4.11.3&ndash;14). It is the
sensible things that through their gradual shaping become, where
applicable, susceptible to receiving the activity of the intelligible
beings, thereby conforming with, and approximating, these, to the
extent possible (VI 4.12.7&ndash;12, 33&ndash;41; see O&rsquo;Meara
1980: 67&ndash;70), echoing some of their characteristics in the guise
of the &ldquo;images&rdquo; or &ldquo;traces&rdquo; that are formed
upon them, and which impart to them the various characteristics that
distinguish them from one another. The causal relations that determine
them always flow from the higher toward the lower, but
&ldquo;participation in&rdquo;, and conformation with, the higher
realities occur each time according to the ability of the lower to
become a recipient of something that, while already present in it,
does not manifest itself until the requisite response or adequacy
obtains (VI 5.8.15&ndash;22). So the emergence of vital functions in a
living body is posterior to its organic constitution by the cosmic
Soul. This constitution renders it capable of receiving the psychic
powers that will become manifest in the corresponding life-related
activities (VI 4.15.8&ndash;18). The gradual and increasingly more
complex presence of such functions allows the manifestation of
progressively higher, and fuller &ldquo;echoes&rdquo; from the
intelligible realm, culminating with the appearance of rational
abilities in the human organism, and the activation of the
corresponding ratiocinative function. In this manner, as a microcosm,
the structure of the human being reflects the overall constitution of
the sensible macrocosm (&Iota;&Iota; 3.5.33&ndash;42,
&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 4.2.6&ndash;11, 3.16&ndash;24, 6.18&ndash;28).</p>

<h2 id="HypoSoul">4. The Hypostasis of the Soul</h2>

<p>
What mainly distinguishes the various ontological levels posited in
Plotinus&rsquo; philosophy is the different degree of unity that
corresponds to each. Thus, while bodies are by their nature divisible,
which means they become apportioned and parceled into ever smaller
parts, the soul, which, according to the psychogony found in
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em>, is made of a divisible and an
indivisible component (IV 1.10&ndash;22, IV 2.2.49&ndash;53), insofar
as it is an incorporeal and supra-sensible entity (IV 7.2.4&ndash;25,
8.43&ndash;9.16), has the characteristic of not becoming apportioned
in the body that it animates. In contrast to, e.g., perceptible
qualities, whose division is a concomitant of the dispersion of the
bodies in which they inhere (IV 2.1.29&ndash;41, VI 4.4.32&ndash;33),
the soul is always present in its totality in every single part of the
body it animates (see Emilsson 1991: 152&ndash;61). This allows it to
manifest a unitary life as its primary activity (IV 2.1.62&ndash;76);
though this life is expressed differently in each individual bodily
organ, it retains its fundamental unity, which enables it to
coordinate all the specific faculties of the living body into a
unitary &ldquo;mode of life&rdquo; (<em>bios</em>). This means that
all individual organs combine and coordinate their functions so that
they carry out jointly a unitary work (VI 4.1.24&ndash;32), one that
corresponds to the nature of the overall living organism that is made
up of these organs and is reflected in the corresponding formative
principle (IV 3.8.38&ndash;55).</p>

<p>
The soul&rsquo;s peculiar mode of life is also intertwined with time;
the latter corresponds to, and is essentially produced by, the
succession of individual psychic acts. The soul is by its nature
forced to retrace the atemporal structure of the intelligible entities
on which it is focused in its &ldquo;contemplation&rdquo;, and to deal
with these one by one, since it is usually unable to comprehend them
all together in their totality (V 1.4.17&ndash;20). This amounts to a
distinctively discursive and distributive approach to intelligible
reality, even on the level of rational apprehension and elaboration of
the relevant concepts, and it is a characteristic feature of psychic
life (V 1.4.18&ndash;20) as it apportions its activity in the context
of temporality, resulting in the birth of time itself, but also in the
emergence of movement in the sensible realm (III 7.11.20&ndash;45; see
Strange 1994: 47&ndash;51).</p>

<p>
Jointly, the souls comprise a unitary hypostasis, that is, they
represent a uniform mode of being, which is often described as
&ldquo;one and many&rdquo; (<em>hen kai polla</em>) (IV
2.2.39&ndash;42, IV 3.8.10&ndash;35, V 1.8.26). This means that, while
they are many and different from each other, the souls are nonetheless
interconnected through relations of mutual kinship
(<em>sungeneia</em>), which allow them to participate in common
experiences (IV 9.3.1&ndash;9) without this compromising the
individuality of each. The question of how souls are individuated, if
we discount their involvement in any manner of relation with the
bodies they animate, preoccupied Plotinus in various phases of his
career. The solution he ultimately suggests consists in making the
soul&rsquo;s individuality depend upon the peculiar perspective each
soul possesses with respect to the way in which it contemplates the
intelligible beings (IV 3.5.1&ndash;15, V 8.10.10&ndash;22; see
Kalligas 1997: 222&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
Various kinds of consciousness emerge in the context of the life of
the soul, depending on the functional level that is activated in each
case. This is because, although the soul, as a hypostasis, is extended
from the realm of intelligible beings all the way to the fringes of
corporeality, the epicenter of its consciousness&mdash;that is, the
&ldquo;I&rdquo; which is usually denoted through the pronoun
&ldquo;we&rdquo; (<em>h&#275;meis</em>) (I 1.7.6&ndash;9,
10.1&ndash;11)&mdash;is commonly located in the area of the
&ldquo;representational faculty&rdquo; which is dubbed
<em>phantasia</em>, and the focus of this can shift either in the
direction of the higher entities of the intelligible realm (VI
5.7.1&ndash;8: cf. Schroeder 1987: 682&ndash;93; Remes 2007:
111&ndash;24; 170&ndash;5; and Tornau 2009: 351&ndash;5), or toward
corporeal experiences (I 1.11.5&ndash;8, IV 3.30.15&ndash;16, V
1.12.15, V 3.3.36&ndash;40). This involves a reorientation of its
attention (III 6.5.19&ndash;22, IV 8.3.21&ndash;30, 8.16&ndash;23),
and it enables the soul to understand itself and the world through
different perspectives (IV 6.3.7&ndash;8, IV 8.7.1&ndash;17; cf. Rist
1983: 142&ndash;8), which is why Plotinus can describe the soul as
&ldquo;amphibious&rdquo; (<em>amphibios</em>) (IV 8.4.31&ndash;35).
This shift of perspective has an impact both on the soul&rsquo;s
epistemic apprehension of reality and on its moral attitude. As
already mentioned, the soul&rsquo;s connection to the body it animates
is not real, in the sense that the soul itself, qua supra-sensible and
utterly incorporeal entity, does not &ldquo;descend&rdquo; nor enters
its body, but merely imposes on it the vital functions that the body
is capable of assuming. Therefore the soul does not directly partake
of the affections and all the other things the body incurs from the
other sensible bodies (IV 4.19.26&ndash;27, 12.30&ndash;32, IV
6.2.16&ndash;18, VI 1.19.46&ndash;48), but simply possesses the
ability to become aware of these affections (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota;
6.1.1&ndash;8, IV 3.26.1&ndash;9) and to attune its reactions to
them&mdash;if any&mdash;depending on its predispositions to these (see
Hutchinson 2018: 75&ndash;99). Unconscious apprehensions, whether they
originate from the intelligible or the sensible realm, also play an
important role in psychic life; for these may influence the soul and
determine its activity without ever becoming fully perceived (I
4.10.6&ndash;21, IV 3.28, IV 4.8.8&ndash;34, 20.18&ndash;36,
21.10&ndash;12, IV 8.8.3&ndash;13, V 1.12.5&ndash;15; cf. Hadot 1980:
249&ndash;56; Chiaradonna 2012: sect. 3 and 4).</p>

<p>
The various ways in which the soul can activate its powers also
determine the animation of different kinds of organisms. Each type of
organism, in fact, comes to be as a consequence of the activation of a
specific type of psychic function. These functions correspond to the
relevant psychic powers that are being activated through the
corresponding formative principles (V 7.2.5&ndash;21). The so-called
reincarnation of the souls is nothing more than the consequence of the
manner in which each soul activates its powers, where the ones that
remain inert may resurface in another phase of its career through time
(I 1.11.9&ndash;15, III 3.4.33&ndash;43, III 4.2.16&ndash;30, IV
3.24.6&ndash;21, IV 9.2.13&ndash;22, VI 4.16.13&ndash;21, VI
7.6.21&ndash;7.8; cf. Hutchinson 2018: 63&ndash;6). Even the
&ldquo;guardian spirit&rdquo; (<em>eil&#275;ch&#333;s
daim&#333;n</em>) that, according to traditional beliefs current at
the time, watches over the soul and stands by it, overseeing its
critical decisions, is but a mere representative of the higher psychic
powers, which belong to the level immediately above the one that is
activated in any given soul (III 4.3.3&ndash;8; cf. Coope 2020:
170&ndash;71).</p>

<p>
Each soul, depending on the abilities it possesses, can fulfill a
specific role in the universe, contributing in its own way to the
providential arrangement of all things (III 2.17.32&ndash;85). When
the soul comprehends this overall design and harmoniously adjusts its
activity within it, then it participates, in the fullest way possible,
to the overall good ordering, avoiding at the same time the
self-seeking pursuits that cause it to divert from the purpose of its
presence in the world (IV 8.4.12&ndash;30), namely to render it more
well-regulated and beautiful, a worthy image of its intelligible
model.</p>

<p>
In general, there is a tendency in Plotinus&rsquo; philosophy to
display the natural world as a sphere for the soul&rsquo;s activity;
the world is an as-good-as-it-can-possibly-become imitation of the
model of the &ldquo;perfect organism&rdquo;&mdash;a view familiar to
us from the cosmogony of the <em>Timaeus</em> (30d1&ndash;b3)&mdash;,
which is distinguished by superb intelligible beauty (III
2.2.1&ndash;3.13). This view brought Plotinus into direct
confrontation with the views of his contemporary Gnostics, who held
that the sensible world is the work of a foolish or even malevolent
creator (II 9.4.2&ndash;26), a place where the souls, created by
another, supreme and benevolent but also &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; God,
are exiled. According to the Gnostics, human souls are at odds and
constantly in conflict with the cosmic forces, seeking to get rid of
the fetters imposed on them when they became tied to their bodies (II
9.5.8&ndash;16). Plotinus vigorously resisted this extremely dualistic
and radically anti-cosmic vision of the world, consistently upholding
the goodness and beauty of perceptible reality: its imperfections
must, in his view, be ascribed to the ramifications of its inescapable
materiality, from which, in fact, all forms of badness stem. More
specifically, matter is the primary cause for the existence of evil in
the world, precisely because its nature consists in a complete
privation of any eidetic characteristic (I 8.11.1&ndash;4; see
Emilsson 2019: 84&ndash;88), a privation which makes it radically
devoid of any trace of goodness. Nonetheless, in and of itself,
<em>qua</em> nonbeing (I 8.3.3&ndash;7, 5.9&ndash;13), matter lacks
the potency to act as an autonomous causal factor, merely constituting
the necessary objective precondition for the appearance of evil,
chiefly in the form of wickedness in the soul (I 8.4.5&ndash;25,
14.1&ndash;50, 15.13&ndash;21). Wickedness occurs when the soul is
diverted from its innate pursuit of goodness because it becomes
disoriented by the reflections of the Good appearing on matter (&Iota;
1.9.4&ndash;8). These cause it to be carried away to aspiring after
things that possess but a mere semblance of beauty and goodness. By
becoming aware of the real nature of things, but also of its own true
nature through philosophy, the soul is released from the illusions
engendered in it by matter (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.2.22&ndash;41).
Liberated from its engagement with corporeality and the associated
affections, it can ultimately turn to the pursuit of the true Good in
the supra-sensible realm (V 1.1.8&ndash;29). Its consequent aiming at
contemplation has an impact even on the way it acts on the practical
level. Indeed, practical action itself is caused by the soul&rsquo;s
innate desire for contemplation, and it takes place when the soul is
distracted or misguided due to its feebleness and its inability to
focus completely on the proper objects of its contemplative activity,
namely the intelligible realities (III 8.1.15&ndash;18, 4.31&ndash;47,
6.1&ndash;14; cf. Wilberding 2008: 375&ndash;83; Coope 2020:
188&ndash;90).</p>

<p>
Naturally, humans occupy a central place among living beings, and all
psychic functions become fully manifest in them. In the case of a
human being, the soul, as a self-contained principle
(&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 1.8.4&ndash;10), is capable to activate by its own
volition all of its powers, ranging from the lower ones, which
correspond to the &ldquo;vegetative&rdquo; functions of nutrition,
growth, and reproduction, and the purely &ldquo;vital&rdquo; ones of
sensation motility and representational &ldquo;imagination&rdquo;
(<em>phantasia</em>) (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 6.4.18&ndash;23, IV
3.30.1&ndash;13), to the higher ones, which pertain to humans only
(but maybe also to the superhuman demonic and divine entities), those
of discursive reasoning and intellection (VI 7.5.11&ndash;30). The
&ldquo;real man&rdquo; is certainly something different from the
compound &ldquo;living being&rdquo;, which, as we have seen, is formed
when the image of an individual soul is projected on an organic body
thereby animating it (VI 7.4.2&ndash;33). The &ldquo;living
being&rdquo; is produced by the eidetic cause, that is, the psychic
constituent to which the living organism owes its life, and which
otherwise transcends it (VI 7.5.2&ndash;8). This psychic constituent
brings us into contact with the even higher realm of the intelligible
beings, affording us the ability to transcend the normal human
condition so as to become something truly divine (IV
8.1.1&ndash;11).</p>

<p>
To become truly divine, we need to develop not only epistemically but
also ethically. In this context we can appreciate how important
ethical living is if people are to find their proper orientation in
the world. Plotinus classifies the basic virtues along a hierarchical
ladder, with the so-called &ldquo;political&rdquo; virtues, which
pertain to the regulation and management of the soul&rsquo;s lower
impulses, those connected with the body, occupying the lowest step.
&ldquo;Cathartic&rdquo; virtues are placed one step higher: through
these, the soul becomes entirely free of its solicitude for the body
(I 6.5.54&ndash;58, IV 7.10.40&ndash;52); on the third step we find
the &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; virtues, which are connected with the
soul&rsquo;s dedication to the intelligible truths. Finally, the
highest virtues, the &ldquo;paradigmatic&rdquo; ones, are the
intelligible models, on the basis of which a human being&rsquo;s
overall ethical life is regulated&mdash;in other words, the
intelligible Forms of virtues such as Justice, Temperance and the rest
(I 2.2.13&ndash;6.19; see Tuominen 2022: 367&ndash;70). By conforming
to these models through intellective contemplation, a human being
comes to resemble God (I 2.6.2&ndash;27), thereby becoming truly
self-willed and self-ruled (VI 8.5.20&ndash;37). In so doing, one
gains his or her &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; (<em>eudaimonia</em>), the
supreme and unshakable psychic state in which, through the full
activation of intellective life (&Iota; 4.3.18&ndash;4.2), one comes
to possess the intelligible truths as a part of oneself (VI
8.5.30&ndash;37). This is the ultimate aspiration of all human
rational efforts, and it results in a kind of serene, eminently
blissful state (&Iota; 6.4.12&ndash;22).</p>

<h2 id="SecoDigrFundPrinPlotMeta">5. Second Digression: The fundamental principles of Plotinus&rsquo; Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
At this point, and before moving on to the presentation of the higher
levels of Plotinus&rsquo; philosophical system, we should summarily
set out some of the fundamental principles that govern the
articulation of his overall theoretical edifice, and are thereby
imparting to it a notable unity and logical coherence. Although not
all such principles are clearly expounded in his work, nonetheless
they can be gleaned from specific passages, references to which will
be provided in what follows. I will attempt to demonstrate that they
rest on a common logical underpinning, which connects them to one
another but also to a number of complementary positions. These
positions are supported in various places of the <em>Enneads</em>, and
they reveal the importance of these principles and their implications.
They are subdivided into fundamental (FP) and supplementary principles
(SP): the former certainly hold greater significance in terms of their
theoretical implications, yet the latter group also occupies an
important place in the structure of the overall system. </p>

<p id="FP1">
<strong>FP1</strong>: First we need to mention the &ldquo;Principle of
the (logical) Priority of the Simple vis-&agrave;-vis the
Multiple&rdquo;. According to this principle, what is ontologically
(and explanatorily) prior is always simpler than what originates from,
or depends causally on, it (V 3.12.9&ndash;10, 16.5&ndash;16, V
4.1.5&ndash;15, V 6.3.21&ndash;22, V 9.8.12&ndash;14). This principle
entails that any multiplicity presupposes and involves elements, each
of which may be considered something simple (V 6.3.1&ndash;25). In
other words, if anything multiple is to be obtained, it is necessary
that it be made up of constituent parts, each of which is one and
distinct from the rest. This means that every multiplicity presupposes
the existence of things that are, individually, simple and unitary;
the collection of all these produces multiplicity. Furthermore, the
congregation of a multiplicity of things also presupposes the
existence of a single criterion of choice, on the basis of which these
things can be set apart from each other and from everything else, and
this must be something that is unitary and applicable to all of them.
For, each thing, whether sensible or intelligible, presupposes some
kind of unity that constitutes it into what it is, even if the degrees
of unity fulfilling this constitutive role may vary between them,
provided this does not cancel its fundamentally unifying function (VI
6.1.4&ndash;7, VI 9.1.1&ndash;17). Thus, for all these reasons, unity
should be regarded as logically, and thereby ontologically, prior to
multiplicity. This fact is emblematically reflected in the system of
the so-called three &ldquo;hypostases&rdquo; as distinct modes of
being, which comprise the main axis around which Plotinus ontology is
articulated as a hierarchical structure (see O&rsquo;Meara 1996:
71&ndash;79). Because each of these hypostases depends on the prior
one, and represents a further gradient along a scale of ever declining
unity: starting from the absolutely simple (and thus ineffable) One (V
3.16.10&ndash;16, VI 9.3.1&ndash;6), we move to the Intellect, where
the interconnected unity of the beings that comprise it entails the
inherence of the whole in each of its parts (V 8.4.6&ndash;8, VI
2.20.16&ndash;23). Subsequently we encounter the level of the soul,
where its various parts are connected to each other through
indissoluble relations of &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; (<em>sumpatheia</em>)
and interdependence (IV 4.40.1&ndash;6). Finally, matter, being the
ultimate and most distant product of psychic activity, is
characterized by the extreme multifariousness of the utterly shapeless
&ldquo;unlimitedness&rdquo; (<em>apeiria</em>) (II
4.15.16&ndash;37).</p>

<p id="FP2">
<strong>FP2</strong>: The second principle can be dubbed the
&ldquo;Principle of the Procreative Power of the Perfect&rdquo;.
According to it, whatever is perfect manifests its perfection by way
of an activity, through which it becomes complete as what it is. The
line of thought behind this principle appears to be the view that each
thing has a fundamental activity, and this activity is a manifestation
of what that thing truly is (V 4.2.27&ndash;9). This means each thing
is distinguished by an activity it exercises which is the very
expression of its perfection and around which it articulates its
identity: vision, for example, is the activity to which the eye owes
its being what it is and its identity is determined by it.
Consequently, this activity may be regarded as the direct
manifestation of a thing&rsquo;s &ldquo;essence&rdquo;, but also as
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; and self-constituting, insofar as without it
the thing would not be what it is. </p>

<p id="FP3">
<strong>FP3</strong>: But, according to Plotinus, this primary
internal activity is always accompanied by another, secondary and
&ldquo;external&rdquo; activity, which depends on it but is directed
toward the outside of the thing that caused it, thereby impacting
other things (V 1.6.38&ndash;39). Thus we have what is usually
described as &ldquo;the Theory of the Two Activities&rdquo;, which
constitutes the cornerstone of the so-called process of
&ldquo;emanation&rdquo;, that is, the process by which the principles
of reality other than the first one come to be constituted (II
9.8.21&ndash;26, IV 5.7.13&ndash;23). A characteristic feature of the
secondary activity is that it is derived from the primary one, and
hence cannot exist without it (V 1.6.38). Nonetheless, it is something
distinct from, and therefore different from, it (IV 5.7.1&ndash;13, V
4.2.30), as its presence or lack thereof in no way affects the primary
activity, which continues to be what it is, irrespective of whether it
brings about any consequences for other things. In this manner a
conception of difference is introduced that is
&ldquo;hierarchical&rdquo; or &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;, given that it
characterizes the effect&rsquo;s relation of dependence on the already
complete and perfect cause, but not vice versa. The secondary activity
is like an image that is distinct and therefore
&ldquo;different&rdquo; from its model, yet dependent on it (V
1.7.1&ndash;5, V 8.12.20), whereas the model is not determined as what
it is on account of its otherness in respect to the image. The idea of
a secondary activity probably originated, at least partially, from
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of procreation, and more specifically from
the thesis that a perfectly developed organism has the ability to
produce offspring, with its progeny being in turn able to grow so as
to approximate the original perfection of their progenitor (for an
alternative option, see Lloyd 1990: 98&ndash;100). Plotinus, though,
habitually illustrates the relevant theory employing the example of
fire and the heat that it emits (I 2.1.31&ndash;36, IV
3.10.30&ndash;34, V 1.3.10&ndash;12, V 3.7.21&ndash;25): while heat,
qua primary &ldquo;internal&rdquo; activity, inheres in fire as its
essential feature (insofar as nothing can be fire unless it is hot),
there is also another kind of heat, different from the former, which,
<em>qua</em> secondary activity, is emitted by, or &ldquo;flows
out&rdquo; of, fire, heating the things that surround it, and
imparting on these, incidentally this time, the property of becoming
hot (V 4.2.27&ndash;33). This second form of activity is evidently
dependent on the former, and it disappears as soon as that one ceases
to be. See further Emilsson 2017: 48&ndash;57; Kalligas 2012:
51&ndash;61.</p>

<p id="FP4">
<strong>FP4</strong>: The fact that perfect activation brings about
the exhaustive manifestation of all existing possibilities brings us
to another fundamental principle, which became known in the history of
ideas as the &ldquo;Principle of Plenitude&rdquo;. According to this,
any possibility, so long as it is real, cannot remain perennially
unfulfilled. For, if it were never fulfilled, this would mean that it
was not a real possibility from the outset (II 9.13.3&ndash;6, IV
8.6.1&ndash;18). This, of course, pertains chiefly to sensible things
that are subject to becoming, but it also applies <em>a fortiori</em>
to intelligible beings (II 5.1.7&ndash;10, VI 2.21.49&ndash;53). This
is because a possibility that cannot be fulfilled, even if only in
theory, certainly does not constitute a real possibility. In this
manner causal relations are established that connect, among others,
all the three fundamental &ldquo;hypostases&rdquo; mentioned
previously, which thus represent a series of successive causes; these
are all reducible to and draw their procreative power from the
inexhaustible dynamism of the supreme First Principle (III
2.2.10&ndash;12, III 8.10.1&ndash;5, V 1.7.9&ndash;22, V
3.15.17&ndash;33, VI 5.12.1&ndash;7, VI 9.6.6&ndash;12). Of course,
these relations are invariably unidirectional, as suggested by
 <a href="#SP2">SP2</a>,
 which is laid out in what follows.</p>

<p id="SP1">
<strong>SP1</strong>: A basic supplementary principle is that of the
&ldquo;Undiminishing Procreative Power&rdquo;, according to which the
secondary activity produced on the basis of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>
 will not cause the primary activity nor the substance to which it
belongs to become diminished in any way (see
 <a href="#SP2">SP2</a>).
 This principle is often expressed with the term <em>menein</em> or
<em>mon&#275;</em> (&ldquo;abiding&rdquo;), which denotes that in
these cases the procreative cause will remain utterly immutable and
unaffected by what follows (V 2.2.1&ndash;3, V 4.2.19&ndash;26).</p>

<p id="SP2">
<strong>SP2</strong>: Another supplementary principle, one also
directly correlated with
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>,
 can be dubbed &ldquo;the Principle of the Predominance of the
(metaphysical) Cause&rdquo;. According to it, anything that is
produced in line with FP3 will necessarily be less
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; than what produces it, insofar as it is
dependent on it (V 1.6.37&ndash;39, V 4.1.40&ndash;2.3, V
5.13.37&ndash;38). As a result, we have a gradual
&ldquo;degradation&rdquo; of entities from the more to the less
perfect (I 8.7.18&ndash;19). This process occurs continuously, without
any intervening &ldquo;leaps&rdquo; from the superior to the inferior
levels (V 1.6.48&ndash;49); in this way, all of these ontological
levels are connected to one another in an uninterrupted succession of
causes and effects.</p>

<p id="SP3">
<strong>SP3</strong>: Finally, a further supplementary principle
determines the formation of each lower hypostasis in two distinct
phases (III 4.1). In the first phase, that of &ldquo;advance&rdquo;
(<em>proodos</em>), the secondary activity that is produced remains
shapeless and indeterminate, constituting a simple otherness, in the
&ldquo;vertical&rdquo; sense of the term, with respect to its source
of origin. In the second phase, that of &ldquo;return&rdquo;
(<em>epistroph&#275;</em>), this activity reverts to its source and is
thereby articulated, shaped, and perfected, acquiring specific content
(cf.
 <a href="#FP2">FP2</a>).
 The resulting perfection leads to the formation of a new hypostasis,
which in turn acquires procreative power by virtue of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>
 (V 1.6.50).</p>

<h2 id="HypoInte">6. The Hypostasis of the Intellect</h2>

<p>
Broadly speaking, according to Plotinus the hypostasis of Intellect
occupies the domain where the intelligible Forms are established, in
other words the entirety of intelligible Essence (&Iota;&Iota;
6.1.1&ndash;8). These Forms, however, although autonomous and
absolutely determined in terms of their content, are not inert
abstract entities (V 5.1.41&ndash;50), but active intellects in a
state of full activation (cf.
 <a href="#FP2">FP2</a>).
 This activation allows them to be interconnected forming an
organically structured system of interrelated and mutually
interdependent truths (III 2.1.26&ndash;34, V 5.1.41&ndash;58,
2.1&ndash;13, V 8.3.30&ndash;4.27). Dialectic is the science that
examines the structure of this system so as to afford a complete
understanding of the whole intelligible realm (&Iota; 3.4.1&ndash;17).
Analysis of each of the beings that are included there reveals a
network of interconnections (&Iota; 3.5.9&ndash;21), and Plotinus
claims that the unity holding them together is such that each of them
contains, potentially (<em>dunamei</em>), all the rest, and at the
same time it is present, in some manner, in all the others, jointly
comprising with them a multiple unity, or &ldquo;one-many&rdquo;
(<em>hen polla</em>) (V 5.3.1&ndash;4, VI 5.9.31&ndash;40, VI
7.14.11&ndash;18). To elucidate this peculiar mereology of the
contents of the Intellect, Plotinus resorts to the example of a
theoretical, purely deductive science such as geometry (V
9.6.1&ndash;10, VI 2.20.1&ndash;24, VI 9.5.18&ndash;20; cf. Tornau
1998: 98&ndash;109). In geometry, every theorem, although in actuality
fully individualized and identifiable, &ldquo;contains&rdquo;
potentially in some manner all other theorems by virtue of relations
of indissoluble logical coherence (V 9.6.1&ndash;10, 8.1&ndash;7, VI
2.20.10&ndash;23), that is, through the proof that establishes its
truth and the links that correlate it with all the other theorems of
that science, insofar as these are presupposed by it or are derived
from its principles. In an analogous way, every intelligible Form has
within itself, potentially, all other Forms (V&Iota;
2.20.16&ndash;21.10).</p>

<p>
Each of the Forms comprising the intelligible realm is a being,
insofar as it is a stable and immutable entity; a living being, qua
part of an organic and active whole; and a wakeful intellect, which
through its unitary and atemporal activation grasps at once the
totality of all other intellects with which it is correlated thereby
achieving complete self-intellection. Therefore it constitutes a
characteristic feature of Plotinian ontology (probably arising from
the influence of the corresponding Aristotelian theory; see Menn 2001:
233&ndash;6) that Intellect encompasses the intelligible beings that
are the objects of its intellection, and that it does not come after,
nor does it precede these, but is fully identified with them (V
1.4.26&ndash;33, V 3.5.26&ndash;28, V 5.2.13&ndash;20, V 9.5.7,
26&ndash;32). And that is why the Intellect does not intellectually
cognize by seeking after some object or other, but by already
possessing the objects of its intellection (V 1.4.16, V
3.9.27&ndash;28, V 9.5.12&ndash;16; see O&rsquo;Meara 2000:
243&ndash;7). This means that the activation of its intellection
constitutes for the Intellect perfect self-intellection (V
3.5.28&ndash;48, 7.18&ndash;22, V 9.5.1&ndash;11), such that there is
no room for any possibility of misunderstanding or error. The
directness of&mdash;every&mdash;intellect&rsquo;s relation to its
intellection ensures the truth of all of its thoughts, which, as was
stated earlier, constitute a network of interconnected theorems. On
the other hand, the very directness of the intellect&rsquo;s
interconnection with the totality of the intelligible objects, to
which its activity is directed, precludes the mediation of discursive
thought. As we have seen, this thought consists in a succession of
distinct acts, and it is a characteristic not of Intellect but of the
soul (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 8.6.21&ndash;26). The implication of this is
that the intellective apprehension of the intelligible truths is
accomplished &ldquo;all at once&rdquo;, in the context of a unitary
act (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 8.8.8&ndash;30), and that this apprehension
completely bypasses the differentiations that characterize the
discursive grasp of their meanings as expressed when they are
propositionally articulated. Therefore this apprehension does not
involve any propositional determinations or entailments (&Iota;
3.5.1&ndash;18, IV 9.5.12&ndash;23) but is rather the joint
apprehension of the already intertwined intelligible objects, in other
words a complex network of truths combined in a unitary intellective
act. It is similar to how vision is able to perceive at once a
composite object, such as a face, even before analyzing it into its
individual constituent components (V 8.4.4&ndash;11). Intellection
does not distinguish between a truth&rsquo;s content and its cause
(the &ldquo;why&rdquo;), given that both necessarily coexist in the
unitary apprehension and comprehension of that truth (VI
7.2.3&ndash;12, 9.17&ndash;21). It is only on the lower psychic level
of &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; (<em>dianoia</em>) that these truths may be
expressed as distinct propositions and theorems, where the overall
comprehensive contemplation is analyzed discursively into
propositional formulations (V 8.6.9&ndash;15). Even the language of
myths can be employed to present the holistic synchronic structure of
the intelligible in the form of temporally discrete episodes (III
5.9.24&ndash;29, III 7.6.21&ndash;26, V 1.4.26&ndash;33,
6.19&ndash;22, VI 7.35.27&ndash;32). It is in this sense that the life
of the soul can be regarded as an &ldquo;image&rdquo; or reflection of
intellective life (V 1.3.6&ndash;12).</p>

<p>
The basic categories that govern the formation of the complex unity of
Intellect are identified by Plotinus with the five &ldquo;greatest
genera&rdquo; (<em>megista gen&#275;</em>) originally introduced in
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Sophist</em> (II 6.1.1&ndash;8, V 1.4.34&ndash;43, V
9.10.10&ndash;14. VI 2.8.25&ndash;46, VI 7.13.17&ndash;34). These are
Being&mdash;which determines each Form as what it is in itself, but
also as the cause of being for everything that participates in
it&mdash;Motion&mdash;which corresponds to Being&rsquo;s procession
from the first Principle, but also to its active coexistence with the
other Forms&mdash;Rest&mdash;which expresses stillness, that is, the
abiding of each being in what it is so that it always corresponds to
its definition&mdash;(V 1.7.25&ndash;26, VI 2.7.26&ndash;45); and,
finally, Sameness and Difference&mdash;through which each Form is
correlated with the rest so that, in combination with them, it creates
a network of ordered genera and species (III 7.3.8&ndash;11, VI
2.8.25&ndash;49). These greatest genera coexist jointly in each of the
Forms of the intelligible realm, and they are thereby its constituent
building blocks. On the other hand, the arrangement of the Forms
inside the intelligible realm is further determined by the arrangement
of eidetic numbers (V 1.5.6&ndash;17, V 5.5.7&ndash;19). These
prescribe the positions the Forms are called on to occupy within the
overall network of entities that comprise the &ldquo;Perfect Living
Organism&rdquo; (VI 6.9.23&ndash;37), that is, the intelligible model
on the basis of which the Demiurge, i.e., Intellect as an active
contemplative entity, fashions the sensible universe (V
9.9.3&ndash;8). The &ldquo;being&rdquo; of each intelligible entity
forms part of an arithmetically ordered structure (VI 6.3.2,
17.23&ndash;32).</p>

<p>
The Intellect and its objects, <em>qua</em> contemplating subject and
contemplated object, respectively, although inseparably linked to each
other, are functionally discrete (V 1.4.26&ndash;34, V
3.10.9&ndash;16, V 4.2.9&ndash;12, V 6.1.7&ndash;23, VI
9.2.36&ndash;37), thus creating space for the appearance of a
multitude of intelligible entities. Yet it is precisely this inherent
duality of the Intellect <em>qua</em> hypostasis that renders it
unsuitable for the role of the first principle of everything. Because
such a principle ought to be utterly unitary, inasmuch as any
multiplicity must, of logical necessity, be posterior to something
simpler and more unitary (see
 <a href="#FP1">FP1</a>).
 This means that the first principle will have to be something that
also transcends Intellect (VI 9.6.42&ndash;54) and its correlated
intelligible Essence. Intellect, then, results from the power of
something that comes before it and is more unitary than it. The
atemporal process through which this production is accomplished is
complex, however, and it involves different stages that, among other
things, determine the dynamic nature of the Intellect. During the
first stage, the first principle gives rise to something, whose only
defining characteristic is its otherness to this principle (cf.
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>).
 In other words, it gives rise to something that is fundamentally
non-One, something that lacks any element of unity. Something of this
kind cannot but be utterly shapeless and unarticulated, given that
each shape or articulation is governed by some manner of unity. This
is why this early stage, from which the Intellect is to result, is
sometimes called &ldquo;intelligible matter&rdquo; (&Iota;&Iota;
4.4.2&ndash;11), so as to emphasize, by analogy with the matter of
bodies, its complete formlessness. At the same time, however, this
intelligible matter owes its emergence to its otherness
vis-&agrave;-vis the first principle, hence it is dependent on it as
an activity that is &ldquo;produced&rdquo; by it (see
 <a href="#SP2">SP2</a>).
 Nonetheless, because in the primordial One&mdash;which, as we will
see, is the first principle&mdash;there can be no
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; activity, insofar as no distinction between
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; and &ldquo;activity&rdquo; can obtain in it
(&Iota; 7.1.15&ndash;20, V 6.6.1&ndash;11), this derivative and
&ldquo;external&rdquo; activity is the &ldquo;first&rdquo; activity
that appears after it, as an effulgence of its inexhaustible dynamism
(cf.
 <a href="#FP4">FP4</a>)
 (see I 8.2.21, III 9.9.7&ndash;12, V 1.6.28&ndash;30, V 3.5.35,
12.27&ndash;41, 15.6, V 5.5.19&ndash;23, VI 7.18.12, 40.20&ndash;30).
It thereby constitutes an activity not of the Good, but arising from
the Good (<em>ek tagatho&#363;</em>) (VI 7.21.5). The undifferentiated
nature of this activity causes it to be bereft of specific content,
which is why it is described as &ldquo;unformed sight&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unlimited life&rdquo; (V 3.11.12, V 4.2.6, VI
7.17.13&ndash;15). However, this activity possesses an innate
propensity for reversion to its origin (cf.
 <a href="#SP3">SP3</a>),
 and for this reason it is dubbed &ldquo;only desire&rdquo; (V
3.11.12), which, however, is accompanied by a still convoluted
prefiguration of the possibilities contained in it (V
3.11.1&ndash;10).</p>

<p>
In the second stage of the Intellect&rsquo;s formation, its activity
can be analyzed into further constituents: the stability of the
Intellect&rsquo;s persistence in what constitutes it as Being
(<em>stasis</em> or <em>mon&#275;</em>; cf.
 <a href="#SP1">SP1</a>),
 and the abovementioned propensity for reversion to its origin
(<em>epistroph&#275;</em>) (V 5.5.17&ndash;19), which culminates in a
&ldquo;contemplative beholding&rdquo; (<em>horasis</em> or
<em>the&#333;ria</em>) of that origin (III 8.11.1&ndash;2, V
1.7.5&ndash;6, V 2.1.9&ndash;12, V 3.11.9&ndash;12). Since the
Intellect is unable to apprehend what it beholds in its absolute
unity, what it contemplates is ultimately analyzed into a multitude of
interconnected truths that are identified with the beings Intellect
itself encompasses (V 1.5.18&ndash;19, V 3.11.1&ndash;16, VI
7.15.18&ndash;22, 16.19&ndash;17.36). Thus, through its activation,
Intellect becomes fully what it is: a perfectly active Intellect
constituted as a multifarious unity. And in that sense it can be
regarded as self-subsistent, meaning that it makes itself perfect as
what it is (V 1.7.11&ndash;17).</p>

<p>
This self-constituting activity of the Intellect is also called Life
(V 6.5.16&ndash;19, V 8.4.36&ndash;48, VI 2.21.24&ndash;37), and is
sometimes identified with what Plotinus calls &ldquo;eternity&rdquo;
(III 7.2&ndash;6), in order to emphasize its atemporality, that is,
the fact that its parts are always jointly present (V 1.4.21&ndash;25,
V 9.10.9&ndash;11), whereas the supreme One is prior even to eternity
(VI 8.20.24&ndash;25). Life, then, qua activation of the Intellect, is
identified with it, so that Intellect and its activity can together
comprise one and the same Being (V 3.6.5&ndash;7, 31&ndash;35).</p>

<h2 id="FirsPrinEverOneGood">7. The First Principle of Everything: the One, or the Good</h2>

<p>
The extreme transcendence of the First Principle in respect to
everything entails a series of very challenging problems with which
Plotinus repeatedly grapples in various parts of his work, each time
attempting to approach them from a slightly different perspective. In
doing so, he has bequeathed us an exciting testimony of his
unremitting philosophical reckoning with the question of the limits of
intellection and of the verbal formulation of our thoughts (V
3.13.1&ndash;12, 14.1&ndash;19, V 5.6.23&ndash;34, VI 7.38.1&ndash;9,
VI 8.8.12&ndash;21, 13.1&ndash;11, VI 9.3.49&ndash;54, 5.38&ndash;40;
see O&rsquo;Meara 1990: 147&ndash;52).</p>

<p>
As we have seen, on the basis of
 <a href="#FP1">FP1</a>,
 every cause must be simpler than its effect, otherwise it would
forfeit its explanatory function. The reason for this is that a cause
that is more complex than the effect it brings about would fail to
account for that effect, for it would lead to even greater
compositeness and complexity. A result of this line of reasoning is
that the First Principle has to be utterly uncompounded, that is, the
absolute One (V 1.8.25&ndash;6, V 3.15.26&ndash;16.5). The absolute
unity that characterizes the first principle of everything, though,
renders it inaccessible to our normal intellective or ratiocinative
powers, hence any reference to it will necessarily be couched in
metaphors, similes, and other such catachrestic modes of
expression.</p>

<p>
The first question that arises is why should anything emerge from the
first principle: could it not remain perpetually and entirely secluded
in itself? Plotinus&rsquo;s response is that the first principle has
such unlimited power that it would be impossible for it (on the basis
of
 <a href="#FP4">FP4</a>,
 mentioned in the Second Digression) to not &ldquo;express&rdquo;
itself as some kind of &ldquo;outflow&rdquo; in the incessant activity
that originates from it (V 2.1.7&ndash;9); yet this effluence also
constantly seeks (on the basis of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>)
 to revert to its origin. This original Otherness has the
characteristics of an utterly shapeless and unarticulated
multiplicity, yet one whose reversion to the One gradually imparts on
it elements of unity, echoes of the original unity of the One.
Eventually, these echoes articulate it into a whole of interconnected
parts, thus comprising the hypostasis of the Intellect. It is clear,
however, that if anything outside the first principle is to exist, it
will have to be something other than the One, and therefore non-One,
which means something intrinsically multiple. Hence, the Intellect is
constituted as a &ldquo;multiple unity&rdquo; (<em>hen polla</em>) (V
1.8.26, V 3.15.22, VI 2.15.14, VI 6.13.52&ndash;53, VI
7.14.11&ndash;12), which allows for the further diffusion of the
inexhaustible dynamism of the One through its organized
structures.</p>

<p>
According to Plotinus, the absolute unity of the primordial One also
entails its complete self-sufficiency because it makes it such as to
be lacking in nothing (II 9.1.19, III 8.11.15&ndash;16, V 3.13.17, V
4.1.12, V 5.12.40&ndash;44, V 6.4.1&ndash;2). It follows that, on
account of this self-sufficiency, there is no other good for the One;
in other words, there is nothing outside itself that it seeks after
(VI 8.7.38&ndash;46, VI 9.6.24&ndash;27). In contrast, the One
constitutes the object of the striving of all other things (&Iota;
7.1.4&ndash;10). The One, then, is what is good for everything which
is other than itself, by already encompassing everything that is good.
This entails, however, that the One is identified with the absolute
Good (VI 9.6.12&ndash;20). We thus arrive at the identification of the
absolute One as the logical origin of everything with the One
described in the First Hypothesis of Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Parmenides</em>, and with the Form of the Good introduced in the
sixth book of the <em>Republic</em> as what is &ldquo;beyond
being&rdquo;. The One is the supreme ontological principle, which
grants to all intelligible entities their being and renders them
knowable (I 7.1.19&ndash;20, III 8.9.2, 10.2&ndash;3, V 1.8.7&ndash;8,
V 3.11.28, 12.47&ndash;48, V 4.2.2&ndash;3, V 5.6.11, V 6.6.30, V
8.1.3&ndash;4, VI 7.17.10&ndash;11, 37.23&ndash;24, VI
8.9.27&ndash;28, 16.34&ndash;36), while also being a universal
productive power (III 8.10.1&ndash;14), which is radically different
from the things that arise from it (III 8.9.39&ndash;54, V
2.1.1&ndash;2, V 3.11.14&ndash;21, 13.2&ndash;3, V 4.2.31&ndash;43, V
5.13.33&ndash;36). However, whereas each being is something specific
and distinct from the rest, the One is nothing specific, constituting
solely and simply the prerequisite for the existence of everything
else (V 3.12.47&ndash;52, V 5.6.1&ndash;15).</p>

<p>
In light of the role the One has in it, Plotinus&rsquo; ontological
system can be described as utterly monistic, but also as
&ldquo;productive&rdquo;, because everything originates from a single
and absolutely unitary first principle which does not depend on, nor
presupposes, anything outside itself, but is, in and of itself,
&ldquo;the (productive) power of all things&rdquo; (<em>dunamis
pant&#333;n</em>) (III 8.10.1, V 1.7.9&ndash;10, V 3.15.32&ndash;35, V
4.1.36, 2.38, V 5.10.10&ndash;22, VI 8.1.10&ndash;11), and cause even
of itself (VI 8. 14.41&ndash;42). One implication of this is the
necessity of what results from it (on the basis of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>
 and
 <a href="#FP4">FP4</a>),
 and at the same time its total freedom, inasmuch as the
principle&rsquo;s activity is not limited by anything external to it,
being determined solely by its nature as the primal Good. In fact,
Plotinus goes so far as to identify the first Principle with its own
completely unfettered &ldquo;will&rdquo; (<em>boul&#275;sis</em>) (VI
8.21.12&ndash;16; cf. Coope 2020: 88&ndash;94).</p>

<p>
One way to discursively approach the One is to provide arguments for
its totally unitary and simple nature by relying precisely on its role
as the absolutely primordial first Principle. As the cause of
everything (V 5.13.35&ndash;36, VI 9.6.55) it must be prior
(ontologically, not temporally) to the things that result from it (on
the basis of
 <a href="#FP1">FP1</a>),
 in such a way that its presence can justify the realization of any
given outcome. It follows that everything ought to be
&ldquo;other&rdquo;, that is, all things must differ from it (on the
basis of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>),
 so that they may result from it. This leads us to the negative
conception of this first Principle as that which is different from all
the things that derive their being from it, which means different from
everything (III 8.9.48&ndash;54, V 1.7.19, V 3.11.18, V
4.1.5&ndash;6). Since all predicates refer to beings, that is, to
things that &ldquo;are&rdquo; something, in one way or another, no
predicate can be accurately attributed to it, insofar as it transcends
everything (V 3.31.2, V 4.2.39&ndash;40, V 5.13.20&ndash;32).</p>

<p>
To conclude, then, although direct intellective apprehension of the
first principle is impossible, reason is in a position to devise
techniques through which it can manage to approach, to a certain
degree, its unfathomable nature (VI 7.36.6&ndash;8). In parallel,
through &ldquo;cathartic&rdquo; practices, humans can develop (I
3.17.37&ndash;38, VI 7.34.1&ndash;4, VI 9.3.14&ndash;27,
9.50&ndash;60) abilities that allow a complete, experiential
&ldquo;union&rdquo; or &ldquo;contact&rdquo; with it (V
3.10.42&ndash;44, 17.25&ndash;28, VI 7.34.8&ndash;21,
36.8&ndash;21).</p>

<h2 id="Conc">8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We need to keep in mind that any attempt, such as this, that seeks to
present Plotinus&rsquo; philosophical system by reference to a
hierarchical arrangement of the various modes of &ldquo;being&rdquo;,
viz. to the so-called &ldquo;hypostases&rdquo;, and to the peculiar
kind of unity that informs each of these, runs the risk of overlooking
the dynamic character of the whole. For we ought to keep in mind that
the different ontological levels are held together by a dual tendency
that emerges in each of them, a tendency that connects them with those
that precede and those that come after them. In fact, at each
ontological level we can observe a tendency of
&ldquo;procession&rdquo; (<em>proodos</em>), or decline towards the
lower hypostasis (through the implementation of
 <a href="#FP3">FP3</a>
 and
 <a href="#SP2">SP2</a>),
 but also a countervailing aspiration of reversion and
&ldquo;ascent&rdquo; towards the higher one (cf.
 <a href="#SP3">SP3</a>),
 through which a given hypostasis is constituted and ultimately
preserved, or &ldquo;abides&rdquo; in what it is (cf.
 <a href="#SP1">SP1</a>).
 These three stages of &ldquo;abiding&rdquo;,
&ldquo;procession&rdquo;, and &ldquo;reversion&rdquo; comprise a
dialectical schema that runs through Plotinus&rsquo; entire system,
endowing it with remarkable cohesiveness and consistency (see Hadot
1960). Thus, the &ldquo;hypostasis&rdquo; of the soul, for instance,
is derived from the secondary activity of the Intellect&rsquo;s
action, while at the same time it realizes itself as the sort of
entity it is on account of its tendency to re-ascend to Intellect
through its contemplation. This contemplative activity is what imparts
to this hypostasis the characteristic kind of discursive unity that
distinguishes it. The soul, in turn, besides engaging in this
self-constituting activity, manifests its solicitude for what lies
beneath it in the form of its secondary activity. This secondary
activity results in the production of an &ldquo;image&rdquo; of the
soul, which brings it into contact with corporeality and ultimately
&ldquo;produces&rdquo; matter itself (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota;
4.1.5&ndash;17, &Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 9.3.7&ndash;13; on this point, see
O&rsquo;Brien 1991). Finally, a further expression of the dynamic
character of this hypostasis is &ldquo;love&rdquo;
(<em>er&#333;s</em>). The soul&rsquo;s unremitting dedication, as well
as that of all other ontological gradients, is expressed through its
love which is directly focused on the supreme principle, i.e., the
Good (&Iota;&Iota;&Iota; 5.4.18&ndash;25, V 5.12.7&ndash;44). Thus
love constitutes the main motive for the re-ascent to the Good through
&ldquo;reversion&rdquo;. This is because, apart from the soul, whose
pursuit is motivated by Beauty (&Iota; 6.9.34&ndash;43, V
8.3.1&ndash;10, VI 7.32.1&ndash;10, 25&ndash;39; see Armstrong 1975:
159&ndash;62), even Intellect itself tends to elevate itself to the
Good by transcending itself and thereby entering a state of inspired
&ldquo;inebriation&rdquo; (V 1.6.50&ndash;53, VI 7.35.19&ndash;27; see
O&rsquo;Meara 2022, 120&ndash;1). Therefore love is elevated to the
status of a universal tendency of all things that has as its object
the Good in itself, within whose perspective everything is coordinated
and conjoined, in imitation of its transcendent unity.</p>

<p>
In this way Plotinus&rsquo; philosophy is revealed as a comprehensive
conception of reality as a whole, grounded on certain fundamental
first principles. It develops into a rather sophisticated system of
interrelated conclusions that jointly attempt to account for the
appearance and constitution of all the different phenomena that
comprise the world that surrounds us. It furthermore seeks to
prescribe the basic directions along which human life may be organized
so as to become more consonant with our truest and at the same time
most intimate aspirations.</p>
