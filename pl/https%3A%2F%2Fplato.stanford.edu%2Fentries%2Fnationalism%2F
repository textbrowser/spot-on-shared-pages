<p>
&ldquo;Nationalism&rdquo; is a word with a number of different
meanings. It may refer to a political movement, to a psychological
disposition (devotion to one&rsquo;s nation), or to a system of
beliefs. The focus here will be on the third of these, and the
philosophical questions that these beliefs give rise to. Nationalism
as a system of beliefs, or ideology, comes in many different shapes
and forms, and can be combined with other belief systems. Thus one can
be a conservative nationalist or a socialist nationalist; one can also
be a Christian nationalist, an Arab nationalist, and so forth. This
article will for the most part tackle questions that arise for all
types of nationalism, whatever their specific character.</p>

<p>
What, then, are the elements that all forms of nationalism have in
common? Arguably, there are three central beliefs, which together
constitute the idea of nationality (Miller 1995: 10&ndash;12). The
first is that nations are real and valuable. When a person thinks that
they belong to a particular nation, and it matters to them that they
do (so it would be a bad thing if the nation were to dissolve or be
destroyed), they are not merely being deluded or irrational. The
second is that nations are ethically significant, in the sense that
people who belong to them have special duties to their compatriots
that are not owed to human beings in general. The third is that
nations are politically significant, and can make special claims to be
self-determining, so the political architecture of the world should be
designed in such a way as to allow every nation to achieve
self-determination in an appropriate form (which might or might not
mean having a state of its own).</p>

<p>
These three beliefs need to be specified more fully and then examined
critically. Although a few philosophers have offered defences of their
preferred version of nationalism in recent years, most philosophical
assessments of nationalism have been negative, often strongly
so&mdash;for example, nationalism is sometimes compared to racism
(Gomberg 1990). On this view, it is part of the philosopher&rsquo;s
calling to rise above the narrow and partial vision of the world that
nationalism represents, in the spirit of the ancient Cynic Diogenes,
who when asked where he belonged, is said to have replied that he was
a citizen of the world. Those styling themselves cosmopolitans today
may argue that national identities are fraudulent inventions designed
to ensure citizens&rsquo; unconditional loyalty to the state, that
displaying partiality to one&rsquo;s compatriots is a morally
arbitrary form of discrimination, and that claims to national
self-determination lead inexorably to violent conflicts over territory
and natural resources. Their hope, therefore, is that as human beings
become more enlightened, nationalism as we know it today will fade
away, leaving behind at most the special affection that people may
have for the physical beauties and culture of the place where they
were born, or have made their home. Or as Fukuyama once put it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
national groups can retain their separate languages and senses of
identity, but that identity would be expressed primarily in the realm
of culture rather than politics. The French can continue to savor
their wines and the Germans their sausages, but this will all be done
within the sphere of private life alone. (Fukuyama 1992: 271)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such hopes are belied by the continuing resilience of nationalism as a
political force, raising the question whether there can be a form of
nationalism that remains politically relevant without being ethically
disfigured as its critics allege. To answer it, we must first
understand what it means to belong to a nation.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="WhaNat">1. What is a Nation?</h2>

<p>
This was the title of a famous lecture delivered by the French liberal
thinker Ernst Renan in 1882, and equally famous is the short and
metaphorical answer he gave to it: &ldquo;a nation&rsquo;s
existence&hellip;is an everyday plebiscite&rdquo; (Renan 1882 [2018:
261&ndash;2). Before coming to his longer answer, we need to know why
the question is important. According to the idea of nationality,
nations are groups of people who owe one another special obligations,
and who have a claim to practise political self-determination, either
through having their own state or through some other form of
self-government. Since such claims are often resisted, it may become a
matter of controversy whether a particular group counts as a nation or
not (consider the dispute between Ukraine and the Russian government
over whether Ukraine is indeed a separate nation or merely a region of
Russia).</p>

<p>
Renan&rsquo;s longer answer to the question was that for a nation to
exist, two conditions were required.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the
other is present consent, the desire to live together, the will to
perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received in an
undivided form. (Renan 1882 [2018: 261]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In specifying these subjective factors, he was explicitly setting
aside as inessential a number of objective group characteristics that
have often been proposed as criteria of common nationality: race,
language, religion, and so forth. He was in other words taking sides
in an ongoing debate with those who take the shared possession of one
or more of these features as necessary and sufficient for a nation to
exist. But a third view is also possible. Even if Renan was right to
insist that shared memories and a continuing will to associate with
one another are necessary conditions of nationality, they are not
sufficient, since other groups&mdash;some religious groups such as the
Amish, for example&mdash;also have these characteristics. It matters
why people believe that they should associate together and practise
self-determination. In other words, it matters that the people who
form the nation should at least believe that&nbsp; there is something
politically relevant that distinguishes them from their
near-neighbours, and that belief cannot be wholly false (even if it
may involve exaggerating the differences&mdash;a point frequently made
by critics of nationality).</p>

<p>
But which distinguishing features are relevant? Some defenders of
nationalism will fasten on to one of the features dismissed by
Renan&mdash;thus there can be racial nationalisms, linguistic
nationalisms, and so forth. To understand nationalism in general,
however, it may be better to follow the lead of J. S. Mill who argued
that national sentiment may arise from a number of different
sources&mdash;he mentions &ldquo;identity of race and descent&rdquo;,
&ldquo;community of language&rdquo;, &ldquo;community of
religion&rdquo;, &ldquo;geographical limits&rdquo; and, &ldquo;the
strongest of all&rdquo;, &ldquo;identity of political
antecedents&rdquo;; the latter is further spelt out as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the possession of a national history, and consequent community of
recollections; collective pride and humiliation, pleasure and regret,
connected with the same incidents in the past. (Mill 1861: 287; see
also here Yack 2012: ch. 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He gives concrete examples to show that none of these, however, is
either necessary or sufficient for nationality (relying at this point
on the reader&rsquo;s intuitions about which of the groups he refers
to count as nations and which do not).</p>

<p>
Although not made explicit by Renan, it is one of the existence
conditions of a nation that its members should wish to be
self-determining&mdash;to achieve or retain control of their own
affairs, since this is what the will to perpetuate their heritage
requires. But should we say that any group that makes a claim to
political self-determination should by virtue of that fact alone be
counted as a nation? In other words, is the will to be
self-determining sufficient, regardless of whatever other properties
the group displays? That seems too permissive, since it implies, for
example, that if a large majority of Texans declare themselves in
favour of independence from the US, that by itself settles the
question of whether Texas is a nation. A more subtle view has been
proposed by Gilbert (1998), who argues that a nation just is a group
of a kind that has a (presumptive) <em>right</em> to
statehood&mdash;presumptive only, because there might be external
reasons for denying a nation the independent state it would otherwise
be entitled to. This turns the issue of nationhood into a normative
question. But Gilbert&rsquo;s view can be challenged. Although the
questions &ldquo;Are the Scots a nation?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do the
Scots have the right to form an independent state?&rdquo; are
certainly connected, it would be odd to suggest that we should begin
by answering the second question, and this will then supply the answer
to the first. It is more plausible to start by examining whether and
in what respects Scottish people are culturally different, have
different collective memories, etc. than people in other parts of the
United Kingdom, and then to ask whether the differences are
significant enough to make their demand for independence
justifiable.</p>

<p>
There is a further question that arises here, which is about the
nature and strength of the tie between nationhood and the claim to
form an independent state. Some writers have drawn a distinction
between <em>cultural</em> nationalism and <em>statist</em> nationalism
(Gans 2003: ch. 1; see also Tamir 1993: ch. 3). According to Gans,
those who endorse cultural nationalism hold that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
members of groups sharing a common history and societal culture have a
fundamental, morally significant interest in adhering to their culture
and in sustaining it across generations. (Gans 2003: 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This then gives rise to a demand for political institutions that can
protect this culture and allow it to develop, which might or might not
mean the cultural nation having a state of its own, depending on
circumstances. For those who endorse political nationalism, in
contrast,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in order for states to realize political values such as democracy,
economic welfare and distributive justice, the citizenries of states
must share a homogeneous national culture. (Gans 2003: 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is apparent that the relationship between nation and state is quite
different in the two cases. From a cultural nationalist perspective it
is loose and contingent&mdash;it is possible that in a given case, the
national aspiration for cultural autonomy might be satisfied by
participating in a multi-national federation&mdash;whereas from a
statist nationalist perspective the relationship is tight&mdash;the
political ends that the nation serves to promote require that as far
as possible all citizens should share in the same national identity.
Since these are both recognizable forms of nationalism, this gives us
an additional reason for keeping nationality and the right to form a
state apart. The wish to be self-determining, discussed further below,
is indeed a distinguishing feature of nationhood, but it need not
always be expressed as a claim to form an independent state.</p>

<p>
Are there further respects in which nations differ from social groups
of other kinds? Several authors have emphasised the <em>modernity</em>
of nations, claiming that nations can only exist in tandem with other
features of modern society, such as the erosion of rigid social
hierarchies (see Taylor 1997, drawing upon Gellner 1983 and Anderson
1983 [1991]; for a dissenting view, highlighting the deep historical
roots of nationhood, see Gat 2013). There is an element of paradox
here, because in many cases nations think of themselves as having
roots deep in the historical past, as standing in a direct line of
descent from the first occupants of the territory that now serves as
the national homeland. Nevertheless, even in cases in which a
contemporary nation was formed around a particular long-standing
ethnic group (see A. Smith 1986), what constitutes it as a nation is
an imagined collective past&mdash;a &ldquo;story of peoplehood&rdquo;
(R. Smith 2003)&mdash;rather than biological descent. So nations could
not exist without widespread literacy and the communication media,
originally the printed word, that allow large masses of people to
participate in the shared culture and the historical narrative that
separates them from other nations. Anderson accordingly refers to
nations as imagined communities,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never
know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them,
yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion. (1983: 15
[1991: 6])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another respect in which nations are an essentially modern phenomenon
is that the people who belong to them understand their relationship as
one of equal standing, even though along other social and economic
dimensions there may be very extensive inequalities between them. This
contrasts with earlier social forms in which people belonged in the
first place to a sub-group, often organised as a hierarchy, and only
through that membership to the larger society (Taylor 1997). Seeing
this allows us to understand the connection between nation and
democracy, though this is not entirely straightforward. As Greenfeld
(1992: 10) puts it, &ldquo;nationalism was the form in which democracy
appeared in the world, contained in the idea of the nation as a
butterfly in a cocoon&rdquo;. The nation does this by providing a
solution to the democratic boundary problem, identifying the group of
people who will form the demos that can then activate democratic
institutions. Of course, not all nations are governed democratically,
but even those that are not pay lip service at least to the idea of
popular sovereignty, shown in many cases by the holding of rigged
elections to legitimise the power-holders. However this identification
of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; and &ldquo;people&rdquo; may be challenged on
the grounds that the idea of popular sovereignty requires that the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; should include all those living under the
jurisdiction of the state, whether or not they identify themselves
with the nation (Yack 2012: ch. 4). Defenders of nationalism will
reply that the very openness of national identities&mdash;the absence
of any single feature that serves to define membership&mdash;can help
to bridge this gap by allowing people from outside of the
nation&rsquo;s historic core to add their own stories to the
collective narrative that unites the nation. Whether nationality can
be a fully inclusive identity is an issue discussed further below.</p>

<p>
Recognising the modernity of nations is essential if we are to
understand the relationship between nationalism and patriotism,
discussed in the section that follows.</p>

<h2 id="NatPat">2. Nationalism and Patriotism</h2>

<p>
In popular discourse, but also in the hands of some philosophers,
nationalism is often portrayed as the ugly stepsister of
patriotism&mdash;as an exaggerated and toxic version of an otherwise
decent emotion, love of one&rsquo;s country (see Nathanson 1993: ch.
14; Schaar 1981; Viroli 1995). However this picture of their
relationship is far too simple. First, although nationalism is
sometimes used to refer to a psychological state, as when we describe
someone as an ardent nationalist, it is centrally a set of beliefs, as
outlined above. Patriotism, in contrast, is in the first place a
character trait, and arguably a personal virtue (MacIntyre 1984). Audi
defines it as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a feature of character that entails a significant degree of loyalty to
one's country and an associated disposition to take pride in it, to be
subject to emotions closely connected with one's perception of its
well-being, and to give some degree of preference to its needs and
interests over the needs and interests of other countries. (2009:
367&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The last part of this definition alerts us to the fact that the issue
of compatriot partiality&mdash;the extent to which it is permissible
to prioritise the interests of fellow-countrymen over those of
outsiders&mdash;arises in much the same way for both patriotism and
nationalism. But there are further respects in which the two ideas
pull apart.</p>

<p>
One important difference is that whereas, as indicated above,
nationalism could only arise under conditions of modernity, patriotism
has a far longer historical reach, and was widely recognised as a
virtue in the ancient world (Dietz 2020; Crowley 2020; Kapust 2020).
This historical continuity was aided by the fact that the object of
patriotic loyalty&mdash;the &ldquo;country&rdquo;&mdash;is often left
unspecified. In classical sources the <em lang="la">patria</em> or
fatherland was usually understood in political terms to mean the <em lang="grc">polis</em>,
in the Greek case, or the republic, in the
Roman case. Contemporary discussions of patriotism, in contrast, are
keen to emphasise that being patriotic does not mean supporting the
state, and may involve actively opposing it (MacIntyre 1984). So
&ldquo;country&rdquo; may be given a wider meaning that incorporates
many of the features of nationality. Kleinig recommends thinking of
it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in more holistic terms, generally as comprising a land, a terrain, a
people, a culture, a history, a collective self-understanding, and a
network of social institutions framed and bound together by the
distinctive juridical structure of a governing order. (2015: 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here a &ldquo;country&rdquo; effectively means a nation-state. So the
contrast between patriotism and nationalism that defenders of the
former are keen to preserve can only be sustained by adopting a narrow
and unsympathetic version of the latter&mdash;defining the nation, for
example, in ethnic terms as a community of descent (Primoratz 2015:
76). This stands in clear contrast to the understanding of nationhood
offered by Renan and Mill.</p>

<p>
A sharper difference between patriotism and nationalism emerges when
we observe that patriotism involves no deep commitment to the idea of
collective self-determination. It is possible, in other words, to be
patriot while still believing that the fatherland is best governed by
outsiders, so long as they govern it well. Of course, if a link is
forged between the fatherland and a particular set of political
institutions, then a patriot will be committed to defending those
institutions (thus one can be a &ldquo;constitutional patriot&rdquo;
along the lines of Habermas 1996 [1998]). But equally one can be both
a patriot and a monarchist who believes that the king rules by Divine
Right, whereas for a nationalist the nation conceived as a community
of equals is the ultimate source of political authority, and therefore
has the right to be self-determining.</p>

<p>
It is also unclear whether switching from nationalism to patriotism is
an effective way of inoculating oneself against the dangers that
nationalism is said to pose, such as licensing territorial aggression
against other countries. In both cases we can distinguish between
egalitarian versus inegalitarian, and morally bounded versus morally
unbounded, versions of the doctrine (see Benner &amp; Miller 2021). In
egalitarian versions, each people is regarded as having equal value,
and as being suitable objects of patriotic (or nationalistic) concern,
so in affirming my loyalty to my own country, I simultaneously
recognise that others should likewise affirm loyalty to theirs. In
morally bounded versions, the partiality that I am entitled to show to
compatriots may only be exercised in a way that does not involve
significant harm to outsiders (for example, breaches of their human
rights). Being a patriot does not entail adopting these more benign
versions of the doctrine, and whether patriotism in practice tends to
manifest itself in egalitarian and morally bounded forms remains an
open question. Cosmopolitans who object to the narrowing of human
concern that loyalty to specific communities can bring with it are
likely to attack patriotism in much the same way as they attack
nationalism (see Gomberg 1990; Nussbaum 1996).</p>

<p>
It is of course possible by definitional fiat to use
&ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; to refer to the egalitarian and morally
bounded forms of group loyalty, and &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; to refer
to the inegalitarian and morally unbounded forms, but this merely
obscures both the conceptual similarities and the conceptual
differences between the two ideas, as outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="EthNat">3. The Ethics of Nationalism</h2>

<p>
According to the principle of nationality, nations are ethical
communities whose members have obligations to one another that they do
not have to outsiders. But many critics have found it mysterious how
simply belonging to such a large and anonymous group could be
ethically significant, and have therefore accused nationalists of
defending irrational favouritism towards compatriots.</p>

<p>
To assess this charge, it is important first to distinguish special
obligations that might arise from nationhood itself from those that
arise from citizenship. As citizens, and therefore as participants in
an ongoing co-operative practice, people will have obligations to one
another on grounds of reciprocity: I benefit when you keep the law and
pay your taxes, so I owe it to you to do likewise (Dagger 1997: ch.
5). Obligations to fellow-nationals, in contrast are a species of
associative obligation: they arise directly from the relationship that
exists between compatriots by virtue of their shared identity (see
Scheffler 2001). Are they therefore redundant in the context of a
nation-state where compatriots are also united by common citizenship?
No, because they help to explain why it is permissible in the first
place to practise a form of citizenship that generates reciprocal
obligations among fellow-citizens from which outsiders are excluded,
and also because they can influence the shape of these latter
obligations. In particular, when citizens are also bound together by
ties of nationality, they can depart from strict reciprocity, where
everyone expects to receive from the state an equivalent of what she
has contributed, in favour of a looser form that encompasses
anticipated redistribution from the better-off to those in need
(Miller 1995: 71&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
If national obligations are best construed as a species of associative
obligation, they face two challenges. The first is a general challenge
to the very idea of associative obligations&mdash;obligations that
stem directly from the relationships in which people stand to one
another, rather than from personal features such as having special
needs or being the beneficiary of a promise. The second is a more
specific challenge to the claim that the tie that exists between
fellow-nationals is the right kind of tie to bring associative
obligations into play. Here a sharp contrast may be drawn between the
nation and smaller groups such as the family whose members are
interacting directly with one another. Since the first challenge
raises general questions about how, if at all, special obligations of
any sort can be justified, it is beyond the scope of this
article&mdash;but see Scheffler 2001, Baron 2002 and the entry on
 <a href="../special-obligations/">special obligations</a>.
 The focus here will therefore be on the second challenge.</p>

<p>
For associative obligations to arise from within a relationship, two
conditions are required. First, the relationship in question must be
intrinsically valuable, which for present purposes we can take to mean
that people&rsquo;s lives go better merely as a result of their
involvement in it, over and above any instrumental benefits that may
also ensue. Second, it must be in part constitutive of the
relationship that it should include having special obligations to the
other participants. These conditions are clearly met in the case of
friendship, for example: having friends enriches a person&rsquo;s life
whether or not they derive any material benefit from the friendship,
and it is part and parcel of being&nbsp;someone&rsquo;s friend that as
well as enjoying their company you should offer them support when they
are in need, even at some cost to yourself (see Raz 1994: 41&ndash;2;
though this is challenged in Lazar 2016).</p>

<p>
The question, then, is whether these conditions can be extended
upwards from small groups such as family and friends to much larger
groups such as nations each of whose members only interacts directly
with a tiny fraction of the rest. Critics such McMahan point out that
whereas small groups are held together by direct knowledge of one
another&rsquo;s characteristics, so that there can be genuine
commonalities within the group, within nations such commonality as
exists depends upon assumptions about a &ldquo;national
character&rdquo; that all members are supposed to share. But this is
in part illusory because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the correlation between membership in the nation and possession of the
national character is inevitably imperfect when membership is normally
a matter of birth, with no screening or selection. (McMahan 1997:
127)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another question raised by critics is whether belonging to a nation is
intrinsically valuable in the way that family and friendship are, such
that it would be real loss to someone if they were obliged to live
apart from their compatriots. Hurka suggests, however, that we should
think of the significance of a given membership as having two relevant
dimensions: how close the relationship between members is, and how
much good the relationship has produced over the course of its
existence. Comparing the family with the nation, he argues that
although the family scores higher on the first dimension, on the
second they score roughly the same, at least in the case of a country
like Canada, where</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if we consider the benefits each Canadian receives from living under
the rule of law and with social programs such as medicare, they are
surely of similar size to those that person receives from his or her
family. (Hurka 1997: 154&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However Hurka&rsquo;s argument might be faulted on the grounds that
the benefits he cites in the case of the nation are instrumental
rather than intrinsic whereas the goods created within the family are
to a large extent intrinsic. To justify national partiality, we must
assume that nationality is intrinsically valuable&mdash;that it is
part of a person&rsquo;s good to belong to an intergenerational
community that over time has created a range of benefits, including
perhaps those that Hurka mentions alongside others. In other words,
what matters intrinsically is not receiving the benefits as such but
being an active participant in the community that acts to produce
them. Why such involvement is significant discussed in
 <a href="#NatSelDetSec">section 5</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
In order to justify special obligations within a group, it is
important that the group should not be disfigured by injustice, either
internally or in relation to outsiders. Such obligations cannot arise
in the case of criminal gangs or the Ku Klux Klan, for example (see
Miller 2005). This condition, however, applies to families and nations
alike, since both are capable of being sites of injustice. A line
needs to be drawn between relationships that inherently involve
injustice&mdash;by their very nature they are discriminatory or
exploitative&mdash;and those that are valuable in themselves but may
nevertheless have the potential to create injustice if their members
choose to act in certain ways, though exactly where it should be drawn
may be disputed. Some critics of nationalism would place the nation in
the first category on the grounds that nations always claim the right
to exclude outsiders from the resources contained in their territory,
even when they suffer severe harm as a result. But here it is
important not to beg the question by taking for granted a particular
account of international or global justice, since what is at stake at
this point is whether nations are entitled to give a certain degree of
priority to their own members.</p>

<p>
To sum up, it is contestable but not entirely implausible to regard
nations as one of the social forms within which members owe one
another special obligations. These obligations are different from,
though not always weaker than, the obligations that hold between the
members of family or friendship groups. E.M. Forster famously said
that &ldquo;if I had to choose between betraying my country and
betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my
country&rdquo;, but this was written in 1938, and it may be doubted
whether he would have said the same two years later if his friend were
detected passing vital information to the Luftwaffe. In times of
crisis, national loyalties may prove to be indispensable.</p>

<p>
If duties of nationality arise directly from the relationship between
compatriots, and are therefore not just convenient ways of discharging
universal duties owed to all human beings, we must ask whether either
set of duties has priority over the other. One very tempting answer is
to say that universal duties must take priority; once these have been
discharged, compatriots are then left free to act on their special
obligations to one another, but these must be sculpted in such a way
that they do not interfere with the performance of universal duties,
understood as duties of justice owed to human beings as such (see
Barry 1999; Tan 2004). As Tan puts it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
impartial cosmopolitan justice serves to define and secure the global
background conditions under which individuals may legitimately favour
the demands of their compatriots as well as pursue other national and
partial projects. (2004: 158)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whether this leaves adequate scope for special obligations to
compatriots to exist will depend on the form and demandingness of
these cosmopolitan duties of justice. Tan speaks of the need to secure
people&rsquo;s &ldquo;baseline entitlements&rdquo; without specifying
how these are to be conceptualised. In particular, if such
entitlements are to be understood in egalitarian terms&mdash;as
equality of resources, capabilities or welfare, for example&mdash;this
will place severe constraints on the exercise of special obligations
among people living in richer societies, since the effect of doing so
will be to confer unjust advantages on their inhabitants, using
resources that could be used for the benefit of poorer outsiders
(Scheffler 2001 refers to this as the &ldquo;distributive
objection&rdquo; to associative duties). If, conversely, baseline
entitlements are understood in sufficientarian terms, as requiring
that all human beings should enjoy an <em>adequate</em> (rather than
equal) set of resources and opportunities, then this leaves more space
for special obligations to be fulfilled. Even so, the result of
constraining duties of nationality within the bounds set by
cosmopolitan duties of justice will be revisionary. Beitz, for
example, having conceded that there are indeed special
responsibilities arising directly from the relationship that exists
between compatriots, nevertheless concludes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the special responsibilities to compatriots that can plausibly be
defended are not nearly as extensive as the priority for compatriots
found in conventional morality. (Beitz 1999: 213)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is in any case not self-evident that cosmopolitan justice must
always override duties of justice owed to compatriots (see further
Miller 2013). If we take a case in which essential resources are in
short supply, it seems permissible to give priority to meeting the
needs of compatriots even where the needs of foreigners are more
urgent. For example in a global pandemic where supplies of vaccine are
for the moment limited, cosmopolitan justice appears to require that
the most vulnerable individuals should receive the vaccine first,
regardless of which nation they belong to. The alternative
view&mdash;priority for compatriots&mdash;holds that all nationals at
serious risk should be vaccinated first, and only then should vaccine
be sent to countries that would not otherwise have access to it. This
alternative view can acknowledge that there is a global duty of
justice to supply the vaccine once it is available, but holds that
under these circumstances it is constrained by the stronger duty owed
to fellow-nationals (for a discussion of this case, see Beaton et al.
2021)</p>

<h2 id="LibNatCri">4. Liberal Nationalism and its Critics</h2>

<p>
Most recent philosophical work written in support of the nation has
offered a defence of liberal nationalism (see Tamir 1993, Kymlicka
1995, Miller 1995, Moore 2001a) although there have also been
advocates of conservative nationalism (Scruton 1990, Hazony 2018). The
contrast between the two is not always clear, and may be disputed
(Daniel 2022), but turns centrally on the form that national identity
should take. For liberal nationalists it must be multi-stranded and
open to revision, making it potentially inclusive of groups such as
ethnic minorities and immigrants whose cultural values may not align
with those of the majority (for a fuller analysis, see Gustavsson
2019), whereas for conservative nationalists the collective identity
handed down from previous generations, while not immutable, must be
treated as authoritative, and national loyalty is seen as a cardinal
virtue.</p>

<p>
As their name suggests, liberal nationalists aim to reconcile
nationalism and liberalism, but the linkage between the two comes in
weaker and stronger versions. The weaker version holds simply that
they are compatible. There is no theoretical or practical
contradiction involved in valuing both the rights and freedoms that
liberals defend and valuing goods such as national identity and
national self-determination that nationalists champion. One set of
goods does not come at the expense of the other: it is possible for a
society both to offer its members a wide variety of lifestyle choices
and to protect them from discrimination on grounds of race, gender and
so forth, and for those members to participate in a shared national
identity and to enjoy collective self-determination as bearers of that
identity.</p>

<p>
The stronger version, by contrast, holds that liberalism needs
nationality to survive: there cannot be a stable liberal society that
does not have a national basis. This has centrally to do with the
conditions under which citizens who in their personal lives may hold
very different values and pursue conflicting conceptions of the good
can nevertheless be tolerant of one another, and trust one another
sufficiently to allow democratic institutions to function. The liberal
nationalist claim is that a widely shared national identity is
necessary for&mdash;or at the very least highly conducive
to&mdash;generating the required level of solidarity. This is
especially so when liberalism takes the form of liberal
egalitarianism, requiring the better off to acquiesce in, if not
positively support, redistributive policies such as those that
together make up the welfare state.</p>

<p>
Critics of liberal nationalism may therefore choose to direct their
fire at either version. In the case of the stronger version, the issue
is to a large extent empirical: is it possible to show that the effect
of having a national identity is to make citizens more likely to trust
one another and/or to support redistributive policies? The evidence so
far is mixed (see Moore 2001b; Miller &amp; Ali 2014; Holtug 2020).
The weaker version, in contrast, raises normative questions about
liberalism itself.</p>

<p>
Some liberals will argue that liberalism leaves no space for
nationalism, since it is founded on a principle of equal concern and
respect for all human beings that prohibits states from privileging
the interests of their own citizens. However most liberals, today and
in the past, have not held such a radical view. John Rawls&rsquo;s
(1971) theory of justice, for example, is designed to apply within a
society that takes the form of an independent state, and he denies
that the principles that make up the theory should be applied at
global level. Although this refusal has drawn criticism, it is
implausible to claim that Rawls&mdash;and other liberal egalitarians
such as Nagel (2005)&mdash;are disqualified as liberals simply because
they do not endorse strong global egalitarianism. The more challenging
question, therefore, is whether liberalism of this latter type must
also conflict with nationalism. Such a conflict might appear to arise
from the liberal commitment to personal <em>freedom</em> or from the
liberal commitment to <em>equality</em> between citizens.</p>

<p>
To see how a conflict might arise over personal freedom, consider
measures that a government might introduce in order to protect or
strengthen its citizens&rsquo; national identity. It might pass a law
criminalising burning or defiling the national flag; it might require
all schools to teach a national curriculum that presents the
nation&rsquo;s history and culture in a good light; it might introduce
a national service requirement; and so forth. In each case it is
removing a freedom that citizens would otherwise enjoy. But does this
show that nationalism and liberalism are incompatible? Only if
liberalism is understood to include a principle of maximising
individual freedom, which would assimilate it to libertarianism. Most
liberals do not hold such a view: Rawls, for example, having initially
proposed such a maximising principle of liberty, gave as his final
considered version that &ldquo;each person has an equal right to a
fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties which is compatible
with a similar scheme of liberties for all&rdquo; (Rawls 1993: 291).
By introducing the idea of a <em>basic</em> liberty that must not be
infringed, Rawls is in effect conceding that there are other freedoms
that may be restricted when there are good (public) reasons for doing
so. Liberal nationalists are also committed to the view that basic
liberties must not be infringed, but they might disagree with other
liberals over where exactly the line between basic and non-basic
liberties should be drawn (does the freedom to burn the national flag
count as a basic liberty?) as well as over the grounds on which
non-basic liberties can be restricted (may compulsory national service
be introduced only in time of war, or also in peacetime as a means of
fostering national solidarity?)</p>

<p>
Next consider why liberal nationalism might pose a threat to liberal
equality. Critics will charge that national identities are always
constructed in such a way that some citizens will be able to identify
more fully with the nation than others. Even though liberal
nationalists insist that these identities must be multi-stranded and
revisable, it will remain the case that some people, especially
immigrants whose cultural backgrounds are different from those of the
national majority, will find it harder to embrace them. For example,
if a country has historically had a national religion, this will have
left a lasting imprint not only on its architecture and landscape but
also on aspects of its culture that are not themselves explicitly
religious (such as the national language). So even though religious
observance is no longer treated as a qualifying condition for
belonging to the nation, those from a different background will feel
alienated to the extent that these cultural features continue to
inform the public culture and social mores of the country they
inhabit.</p>

<p>
The charge, then, is that when states take the form of nation-states,
as liberal nationalists argue that they should, some part of the
citizen body will think of themselves, and be thought of by the
majority, as &ldquo;second-class citizens&rdquo;. This will be so even
if, in law and public policy, they are treated in exactly the same way
as those from the cultural majority. For egalitarian reasons,
therefore, the only form of nationalism that is acceptable is a purely
&ldquo;civic&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo;) nationalism
according to which the common identity that holds citizens together is
to be understood in narrowly political terms as allegiance to certain
political principles, and institutions such as a constitution or
parliamentary democracy (Ignatieff 1993, Barry 1999).</p>

<p>
To this, liberal nationalists will respond that the idea of a purely
civic nation is in fact a myth, As Yack puts it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it suggests that your national identity is nothing but your choice:
you are the political principles you share with other like-minded
individuals. Real nations, in contrast, combine choice and cultural
heritage. (2012: 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Not only are there no wholly civic nations to be found in the world,
but such an identity could not have the motivating power of identities
with cultural and historical as well as political elements (for a
critique of the contrast between civic and ethnic conceptions of
national identity, see Laborde 2002: 597&ndash;8). There would, for
example, be no reason to resist the state you belong to being absorbed
by another state so long as the political principles on which it was
based continued to be observed.</p>

<p>
The liberal nationalist response to the equality challenge, therefore,
is to concede that at any moment there are likely to be groups who
find it difficult to embrace their state&rsquo;s national identity as
it stands, but to insist on the dynamic character of these identities
and their ability to absorb new cultural elements from
hitherto-excluded minority groups. The remaking of national identity
can be a democratic process in which cultural icons and practices are
debated, and in some cases modified or abandoned. Where a yes/no
decision on some cultural issue has to be made, the majority view (if
there is one) must prevail, but even here it may be possible to
provide recognition for minority perspectives. Thus if a national
event such as a coronation or presidential inauguration has
traditionally involved a religious ritual, this can be modified so as
to allow representatives of minority faiths to play a part in the
ceremony alongside those of the historically recognised religion (for
a fuller discussion see Miller 2020).</p>

<h2 id="NatSelDetSec">5. National Self-determination and Secession</h2>

<p>
As indicated earlier, the desire to be self-determining is integral to
nationality. Nations are groups of people who want to decide the terms
on which they are to live together, and also the impact they will make
on the outside world. Such claims are often met with scepticism,
however. Critics will point to the size of nations and also to their
internal diversity. For self-determination to be valuable, it seems it
must be valuable not just for the nation as a collective but also for
its individual members. But how is it possible for a person to feel in
control of their destiny when they are one among many millions, and
when on many issues they find themselves in deep disagreement with
their compatriots?</p>

<p>
Under what conditions, then, can a nation be self-determining? The
first is that it should exist in an environment that allows it make
collective choices over matters that are important to its members.
This is not to be confused with the issue of state sovereignty. A
nation might control a state that is formally sovereign (it is subject
to no higher legal authority) and yet fail to be self-determining, for
example because it is wholly reliant for its subsistence on a
neighbouring state that uses its dominant position to determine what
the first state does. Of course, no nation is able to act entirely
without external constraint, so we see immediately that national
self-determination in practice is a matter of degree, and the
corresponding normative demand can only be that each nation should
enjoy an <em>adequate</em> measure of self-determination.</p>

<p>
In particular, a self-determining nation must be able to exercise
jurisdiction over the area of land that it claims as its national
homeland. The relationship between nation and territory is
constitutive (see the section on nationalist theories in the entry on
 <a href="../territorial-rights/#NatiTheoMillMeisGans">territorial rights and territorial justice</a>)
 and so self-determination must involve, among other things, deciding
on the future use and appearance of the physical space that it regards
as its own. To support such territorial claims, nations can appeal to
the transformative labour of past and present generations that have
enhanced the value of the territory, to its symbolic importance as a
repository of national culture and national memory, or to both at once
(Miller 2012). Of course, these claims are often disputed when rival
nations claim the same area of land as rightfully theirs on such
grounds.</p>

<p>
The second condition is that the nation should have a mechanism for
making collective decisions that allows all members to see the outcome
as an expression of their collective will (for general discussion of
the institutional conditions that are necessary for a people to be
self-determining, see Stilz 2016). This means both something more and
something less than that it should be governed democratically.
Something less, because it is at least possible that there can be what
Rawls (1999) has called &ldquo;decent hierarchical peoples&rdquo;
whose rulers take decisions guided by comprehensive doctrines,
typically religious in character, that are very widely shared in the
society. So long as there are mechanisms that ensure that the ruling
hierarchy remains aligned with the beliefs and values of the people as
a whole when making these decisions&mdash;such as allowing dissenting
voices to be heard without fear of suppression&mdash;a form of
self-determination can be achieved. Something more, because democracy
in its procedural form, such as the holding of regular, free
elections, may not be sufficient for self-determination if there is no
attempt to reach policy outcomes that everyone is able to endorse. For
example, in the case of a nation divided along religious lines,
self-determination requires that those in the majority camp should not
use their position of advantage to vote through policies that
discriminate severely against the minority. What matters is that
everyone should be able to regard the policies that are chosen as a
reasonable expression of their underlying values, even if they are not
the policies they would have chosen themselves.</p>

<p>
Although the desire to be self-determining is integral to nationality,
more needs to be said to explain why self-determination, at national
level, should be valuable. Here we should distinguish between
instrumental and intrinsic arguments for the value of
self-determination (Margalit &amp; Raz 1990; for a full discussion of
this value, see Stilz 2016). The instrumental argument is fairly
straightforward: when a group has collective preferences about its
future way of life, the most secure way for it to ensure that those
preferences are met is to make decisions for itself. Outsiders, no
matter how well-intentioned, are always liable to misunderstand what
the group wants, or to strike the wrong balance between different
priorities. The intrinsic argument&mdash;the claim that
self-determination is valuable quite apart from the concrete outcomes
that it produces&mdash;is, however, more open to challenge.</p>

<p>
One version of that argument appeals to personal autonomy. It says
that where individuals are involved in making decisions on behalf of
the groups they belong to, outside interference with these collective
decisions diminishes their autonomy. Just as it matters to someone
that they should be in control of their own personal life, it matters
that the groups they are involved in controlling should be
self-determining, and therefore not subject to external interference
(Wellman 2005). Margalit and Raz (1990) argue that nations are
&ldquo;encompassing groups&rdquo;, having a number of special features
that make membership in such groups particularly important to those
who belong to and identify with them. It is also important to be able
to express one&rsquo;s membership by participating in political
activities within the group. Therefore, they conclude,
&ldquo;self-government is inherently valuable, it is required to
provide the group with a political dimension&rdquo; (1990: 451). But
not everyone accepts bridging arguments of this kind. Buchanan (1998a:
17&ndash;18) points to the gulf that exists between individual and
collective self-government (which he identifies with democratic
decision-making):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is simply false to say that an individual who participates in a
democratic decision-making process is self-governing; he or she is
governed by the majority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Personal autonomy, he argues, can be expressed in many different areas
of social life, and need not require political involvement at national
level.</p>

<p>
A second version of the intrinsic argument in favour of
self-determination appeals to respect for persons. The claim is that
&ldquo;individuals are disrespected in a morally objectionable manner
when their group is denied self-determination&rdquo; (Altman &amp;
Wellman 2009: 38). Where a group has developed the ability and
willingness to govern itself, to deny it that right is to show them
disrespect. This is particular clearly illustrated, Altman and Wellman
claim, in the case of colonial government, which denies the colonised
the &ldquo;recognition respect&rdquo; they deserve by virtue of their
willingness to perform the functions that are needed to support a
legitimate state.</p>

<p>
This way of explaining the value of self-determination does however
raise the question whether groups of all kinds, not only nations, can
claim to be disrespected if they are not granted the right to be
self-governing. Can the colonial case be generalised to apply, for
example, to minority nations living within established states who make
claims to secede? It appears not. Could the Scots, for example, claim
that they were being disrespected if the government of the United
Kingdom turned down their demand for Scotland to become an independent
state? The obvious counterargument is that since Scots are being
treated as equal citizens within the UK, with the same rights and
responsibilities as other citizens, their political capacities are
already being shown appropriate respect. Nor does the refusal to grant
independence communicate the message that the Scots would be incapable
of forming a state of their own. It merely signals they have yet to
provide a good enough reason for creating such a state.</p>

<p>
Nationalists often face the charge that their commitment to political
self-determination opens the door to political turmoil. According to
Canovan,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is of the essence of nationalism&hellip;. to be a revolutionary
doctrine, calling for the destruction of existing states and the
construction of new ones with different boundaries, and thereby
upsetting existing legal frameworks. (1996: 11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no doubt that, in the case of Europe at least, nationalism
has had this corrosive effect at certain historical moments, such as
in the revolutionary period in the mid-nineteenth century, and in the
aftermath of World War One. But these were also moments when
long-established empires were in the process of collapsing. Where
nationalist demands emerge within states that are already constituted
as nation-states, there are options besides secession and
boundary-redrawing that can respond to these demands (for a full
discussion, see Norman 2006).</p>

<p>
One such response is nation-building. Nation-states cannot in any case
help being involved in reproducing the national identity and culture
of their people over time, often in ways that are so banal as to pass
very largely unnoticed (Billig 1995), and so faced with separatist
demands they can make a more conscious attempt to strengthen the
inclusive aspects of national identity, while at the same time
adjusting its content to make it more accessible to members of
minority nations. For example, national histories, which anyway are
continually in process of being rewritten in the light of contemporary
political concerns, can give greater prominence to the role played by
people from these groups in promoting the nation&rsquo;s interests and
contributing to its culture. This need not&mdash;and should
not&mdash;involve outright falsification of the national past (see the
 <a href="#NatIrr">following section (&sect;6)</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A second response is to create institutions that allow national
minorities to be self-determining in areas that are important to
them&nbsp;within the boundaries of the larger nation-state (Kymlicka
1995, esp. ch. 6). This could be done on either a territorial or a
non-territorial basis. If the nationalism of these groups is
predominantly cultural in character, it may be sufficient to give them
control over the relevant cultural institutions. (Gans 2003: ch. 3;
Tamir 1993: ch. 3). More commonly, devolved forms of government can be
created in those parts of the territory where minority nations mainly
live (and which they regard as their homeland), as has occurred in
countries such as Belgium, Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom. These
arrangements are not entirely stable, since the experience of
self-government may give national minorities the confidence to ask for
yet more rights, while experiencing the frustration of having to
operate within broad policy guidelines and budgetary constraints
imposed by central government. Thus there is the risk of a slippery
slope that leads to secession, and for that reason states that attach
great importance to preserving national unity may be very reluctant to
grant minorities political rights in the first place (Kymlicka 2004).
Yet where such anxieties can be allayed, perhaps through inclusive
nation-building policies as outlined above, partial autonomy for
national minorities may produce a better outcome all round than
outright secession.</p>

<p>
One reason to think so is that secession, when it occurs, is rarely
&ldquo;clean&rdquo;, in the sense of establishing a nation-state
virtually all of whose inhabitants endorse the new arrangement.
(Miller 1998). In many cases there will be a minority within the
minority nation who strongly prefer to remain within the larger state,
and whose interests may be put at risk if the secession occurs. There
may be disagreement over where the territorial boundary between the
newly-created state and the rump state should be drawn, about the
division of the spoils in relation to natural resources and other
assets, and about who should be entitled to take part in any proposed
referendum on secession. Although there have been historic examples of
consensual secessions, these are the exceptions to the rule that
secessions are at best politically contested and at worst occasions
for civil war. It is therefore important to underline that believing
in the value of national self-determination does not entail believing
that any group that qualifies as a nation must be granted the right to
form its own independent state.</p>

<h2 id="NatIrr">6. Is Nationalism Irrational?</h2>

<p>
Albert Einstein is said to have described nationalism as an infantile
disease&mdash;&ldquo;the measles of mankind&rdquo; (1929:
117)&mdash;which would therefore pass away once human beings,
together, had reached maturity. As noted earlier, many philosophers
have shared his conviction that it represents a collective mental
aberration of some kind. But if so, in what more specific way is
nationalism claimed to be irrational? This section explores three main
possibilities.</p>

<p>
First, nationalism might be irrational because it requires the
arbitrary privileging of one particular identity out of the many
identities that might matter to a particular person. Buchanan (1998b)
has developed this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in pluralistic societies nationality will be only one source of
identification and allegiance among others, and for some people it
will be of little or no importance relative to other sources of
identification and allegiance, whether these are cultural or
occupational or religious or political or familial. (1998b: 294)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nationalism proclaims that national identity reigns supreme, and this,
he argues,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is an insult to the equal status of every citizen whose primary
identity and allegiance is other than national and to all who have no
single primary identity or allegiance. (1998b: 295)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Defenders of nationality will reply that this seriously misrepresents
their view. They make no claim about the relative importance of
different forms of identity to the person whose identity is in
question. It is not misguided or ethically problematic for someone to
say that their religious identity matters more to them than their
national identity, so that if forced to relinquish one of these, they
would opt to forfeit their national identity (for example by choosing
to go into exile). National identity is privileged only in the sense
that it can form the basis for a stable form of political order. In
certain circumstances, this would provide the justification for
nation-building policies as described above. But the rationale for
such policies is not that national identities are of greater worth
than identities of other kinds, and therefore should be promoted at
their expense, but that in the absence of a sufficient degree&nbsp;of
identification at national level, the society is liable to break down,
or at least be unable to sustain democracy and social justice. Even
those who do not find national identities intrinsically valuable can
therefore have reason to support their promotion.</p>

<p>
Second, some critics will claim that the very act of identifying with
a nation is irrational. This might be because there are in fact no
such things as nations, understood as bodies of people who share the
characteristics, such as a common culture, that are said to mark out
one nation from another. The idea of &ldquo;national character&rdquo;
is illusory, these critics say. A Frenchman will, in general, have no
more in common with another Frenchman than he will with a German or a
Spaniard. So if nationalists claim that nations are like-minded groups
of people among whom special responsibilities and obligations arise,
they are simply deluded.</p>

<p>
One response to this was suggested by David Hume, who conceded however
that national similarities were often exaggerated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the vulgar are apt to carry all <em>national characters</em> to
extremes; and having once established it as a principle, that any
people are knavish, or cowardly, or ignorant, they will admit of no
exception, but comprehend every individual under the same censure. Men
of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgements: Though at the same
time, they allow, that each nation has a peculiar set of manners, and
that some particular qualities are more frequently to be met with
among one people than among their neighbours. (Hume 1748 [1985:
295])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s suggestion might be developed by proposing a family
resemblance view of nationhood, according to which there is no feature
that serves as a necessary condition for belonging to a particular
nation, but instead there is a range of features that are found more
often among the members of one nation than among others (see Moore
2020 for discussion). This view can then allow that one particular
Swede might have a greater number of features in common with a
particular Italian than she does with another individual Swede, while
still maintaining that Swedes overall have many more overlapping
features with one another than they do with Italians. In that sense
nations as bodies of people with cultural and other qualities in
common are not mere illusions.</p>

<p>
Personal identification with a nation may be regarded as irrational
for a different reason. Critics claim is that it allows those who are
personally undistinguished to bask in the reflected glories of their
nation, whose achievements are accordingly greatly exaggerated.
Schopenhauer, for example, thought that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
national pride is transparently a surrogate kind of pride for
individuals who possess no qualities of their own&hellip;.unremarkable
people&mdash;and to him, most people were unremarkable&mdash; tend to
boast of the accomplishments of some greater collective to which they
belong; they grasp after something that will make them seem great and
impressive but find nothing in themselves. (Norberg 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A similar charge was laid by Erich Fromm who, borrowing Freud&rsquo;s
concept of narcissism, claimed that nationalism often functions as a
form of &ldquo;group narcissism&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What should feed the narcissism of a poor man, who has little social
prestige, whose children even tend to look down on him? He is
nothing&mdash;but if he can identify with his nation, and can transfer
his personal narcissism to the nation, then he is
everything&hellip;&ldquo;My nation is the strongest, the most
cultured, the most peace-loving, the most talented of all
nations&rdquo;. (Fromm 1980: 51&ndash;2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The charge being laid here&mdash;that identifying with a nation is
irrational because it is driven by an unacknowledged need to
compensate for a sense of personal worthlessness&mdash;is speculative
and hard to assess (similar claims have been made about religious
belief). More tractable is that part of the critique which says that
nationalists everywhere make claims about the superiority of their
country to others, along relevant dimensions, which for obvious
reasons cannot all be true. Keller goes further, arguing that loyalty
to a country involves a form of &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo;, whereby
belief in the nation&rsquo;s superior qualities is protected by
blocking out evidence that might undermine it. A patriotic person</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is motivated to believe that her country has certain features, and she
marshals the evidence in ways that support this belief; but she cannot
maintain the belief in its full-blooded form if she admits to herself
that it is not grounded in an unbiased assessment of the evidence; so
she does not make this admission. (Keller 2005: 580)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is worth pointing out here that even if these psychological
mechanisms are ubiquitous among those who hold nationalist beliefs,
this would at most show that nationalism as a social phenomenon is
irrational, not that the beliefs themselves are unfounded (showing
that a certain belief is widely held for reasons unrelated to its
truth may suggest, but certainly does not prove, that the belief
itself is false). Moreover the evidence collected by psychologists
suggests that among those who identify with their nation, there is
considerable variation both in the content and level of
&ldquo;national pride&rdquo;&mdash;the features of the country that
are valued by the identifier&mdash;and in the extent to which their
nationalism is critical or uncritical&mdash;whether they endorse the
direction that their country is taking, or on the contrary censure it
and wish it to change course (see Huddy &amp; Khatib 2007; Miller
&amp; Ali 2014). The causal factors that may lead a particular person
to identify with and support their nation are sufficiently varied to
undermine the charge that such commitments must always be
irrational.</p>

<p>
There is, however, one further way in which nationalism might be
judged to be irrational. This has to do with the prevalence of
<em>national myths</em> in the historical narratives that form an
essential part of every national identity&mdash;the &ldquo;rich legacy
of memories&rdquo; that Renan believed every nation must possess (for
discussion see Miller 1995: ch. 2: Archard 1995; Abizadeh 2004) These
memories are of significant events in the nation&rsquo;s
history&mdash;often involving either national triumphs or national
disasters&mdash;and it is undoubtedly the case that the way that these
events are remembered by the general public in the country in question
is likely to diverge significantly from the best scholarly accounts as
provided by historians. Here, however, it is important to distinguish
between two kinds of myth: what we might call <em>pure</em> myths,
such as legends of how the nation was first established by some heroic
figure in the distant past (Aeneas founding Rome, his grandson Brutus
founding Britain) which are a feature of pre-modernity, and cannot
survive the conditions of free enquiry that prevail in liberal
societies; and what we might call <em>partial</em> myths, where
persons who undeniably lived or events that undeniably occurred are
glossed in such a way as to fit into a &ldquo;story of
peoplehood&rdquo; that serves a normative purpose for people now, for
example by reassuring them that they are the legitimate holders of the
territory they occupy, or providing them with ethically inspiring
models of conduct to emulate. But is the omnipresence of such partial
myths sufficient to show that nationalism is irrational?</p>

<p>
There are two points worth making here. First, it is important to note
that someone may endorse a partial myth while recognising that the
story that they are telling, while faithful to the spirit of the
original event it describes, is not accurate in all its details. To
use an American example, we now know that the Liberty Bell was not in
fact rung in Philadelphia on July 4<sup>th</sup> 1776, and that Paul
Revere did not actually ride all the way from Lexington to Concord,
but these stories will continue to be told and retold because they
form part of a wider narrative about an event&mdash;the American
Revolution&mdash;that undoubtedly did occur, and whose significance is
unquestionable. Some may believe these accounts to be literally true,
while others may recognise their partly mythical character, but the
importance of a shared narrative as a source of national unity is such
as to make it reasonable in certain contexts to suspend disbelief.</p>

<p>
Second, the moral value of a national myth will depend upon the ends
that it serves to promote, and in particular whether the story it
tells about the nation&rsquo;s past is one that all of its present
members can identify with. To continue with the same example, the myth
that the American Revolution was an all-American rising against the
oppressive British, and not at the same time an internal conflict
between patriot and loyalist factions within America, also obscures
the role played by Black Americans (many of whom fought on the
loyalist side) in this event. In doing so, it conceals the racial
dimension of the Revolution. The myth does not serve Black Americans
today well, and needs to be recast to carry out the unifying and
motivating functions that national myths, in the best cases, can
perform.</p>

<p>
This section has reviewed reasons of different kinds for holding that
nationalism is irrational, some having to do with what nationalists
believe, and others having to do with the motivation that induces
people to hold these beliefs. The general charge of irrationality
cannot be substantiated, but it remain an open question how far the
version of nationalism that (some) philosophers are willing to defend
is also the version that moves people in different places to act
politically, sometimes with earth-shaking consequences.</p> <!-- bib check -->
