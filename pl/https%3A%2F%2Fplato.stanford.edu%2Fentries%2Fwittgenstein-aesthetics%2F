<h1>Wittgenstein&rsquo;s Aesthetics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jan 26, 2007; substantive revision Tue Apr 22, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Given the extreme importance that Wittgenstein attached to the
aesthetic dimension of life, it is in one sense surprising that he
wrote so little on the subject. It is true that we have the notes
assembled from his lectures on aesthetics given to a small group of
students in private rooms in Cambridge in the summer of 1938
(Wittgenstein 1966, henceforth LA) and we have G. E. Moore&rsquo;s
record of some of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s lectures in the period
1930&ndash;33 (Moore 1972). Of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own writings, we
find remarks on literature, poetry, architecture, the visual arts, and
especially music and the philosophy of culture more broadly scattered
throughout his writings on the philosophies of language, mind,
mathematics, and philosophical method, as well as in his more personal
notebooks; a number of these are collected in <em>Culture and
Value</em> (Wittgenstein 1980a). In another sense, it is not
surprising at all, precisely <em>because</em> of the central position
he gave to the aesthetic: in writing about questions of meaning, as he
did throughout his life from the earliest pre-<em>Tractatus</em>
(Wittgenstein 1921/1922, 1971) writings to the remarks from the last
weeks of his life in <em>On Certainty</em> (Wittgenstein 1969), in
writing about perception, as he did in Part II of <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em> (Wittgenstein 1953, 2009, henceforth PI),
<em>Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology</em>, Volumes I and II
(Wittgenstein 1980b, 1980c), and <em>Last Writings on the Philosophy
of Psychology</em>, volume I (Wittgenstein 1982), and in writing about
the contextual prerequisites to the emergence of sense in his
philosophy of mind and language (in PI as well as his writings on the
philosophy of mathematics), he was writing&mdash;if at one
remove&mdash;about aesthetics. For questions of meaning, of
perception, and of sense are all clearly central to aesthetic
experience, and the writing he undertook on these subjects holds
significance for questions of artistic meaning and interpretation that
are still being explored and articulated (Lewis 2004; Dauber &amp;
Jost [eds] 2003; Gibson &amp; Huemer [eds] 2004; Hagberg 2017).
Wittgenstein placed the aesthetic, not on a distant periphery of
philosophical subjects, but then not at the center of a grouping of
such interests either&mdash;for then it would still be a subject area
unto itself. Rather, Wittgenstein interweaves the subject&rsquo;s
various and variegated strands throughout his writing in a way that in
some cases shows explicitly, and in many more cases suggests
implicitly, the layered interconnections between aesthetic
considerations and every other area of philosophy upon which he wrote.
So this article will primarily look into the details of the record we
have of his lectures on the topic (which, predictably, take up many
connections to extra-aesthetic issues along the way), but throughout
try to offer a reading of them that situates them into the larger
context of his philosophical work. And in his writings on aesthetics,
one can glean a good deal concerning his overall approach to
philosophical problems and issues: while previous work in aesthetics
(and much work since the time of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s writing) often
pursued an essentialist strategy, that is, it tried to identify the
essence of, e.g., beauty or the single defining feature of art, his
approach is rather to assemble particular cases of aesthetic
perception, judgment, understanding, and response, and learn from
those without the kind of reductionism that is endemic to essentialist
methodological presuppositions.</p>

<h2 id="CritTradAest">1. The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics</h2>

<p>
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s opening remark in his lectures on aesthetics (LA)
is double-barreled: he states that the field of aesthetics is both
very big and entirely misunderstood. By &ldquo;very big&rdquo;,
Wittgenstein means both that the aesthetic dimension weaves itself
through all of philosophy in the manner suggested above, and that the
reach of the <em>aesthetic</em> in human affairs is very much greater
than the far more restricted reach of the <em>artistic</em>; the world
is densely packed with manifestations of the aesthetic sense or
aesthetic interest, while the number of works of art is very much
smaller. It is clear throughout these lectures that he means that any
comprehensive account of the aesthetic would acknowledge the former,
and not just&mdash;as a good number of philosophical accounts have so
restricted themselves&mdash;the latter. By &ldquo;entirely
misunderstood&rdquo;, it emerges in these lectures that he means both
(1) that aesthetic questions are of a conceptual type <em>very</em>
distinct from empirical questions and the kind of answer, or
conceptual satisfaction, we want is very unlike what we might get from
an experiment in empirical psychology, and (2) that the
philosophically traditional method of essentialistic
definition&mdash;determining the essence that all members of the class
&ldquo;works of art&rdquo; exhibit and by virtue of which they are so
classified&mdash;will conceal from our view more than it reveals.</p>

<p>
In addition, Wittgenstein does not share the widespread methodological
assumption that the question &ldquo;Why is that a work of art?&rdquo;
will automatically apply to all cases generically, where the answer
would always be to simply name the essence of art and then point out
its presence in that particular case. Such questions do arise, but he
shows that they arise only in particular contexts. He does not mention
these cases, but for us such cases might be found art, driftwood art,
multiple radios playing on a stage, specific-duration silence with a
closed keyboard, nothing but black paint on a canvas, and so forth.
And in those cases, the criteria for their answers will emerge in a
context-specific way, often by revealing connections between the work
in question and previous works in its genre, or by articulating the
significance of the work in question for both works that preceded it
and works that followed it. Similarly, he does not put forth general
claims concerning, for example, the way that music in general is like
language in general; instead, he observes particular cases in which
one piece, or a movement, or a melodic phrase or rhythmic pattern, has
more in common with spoken language than does another. Such analogies,
for him, draw their life from the detailed consideration of particular
cases, not from overarching generalities. In the case of music, any
such aesthetic approach would require as a precondition both a
cultivated grasp of the intricate details of a wide range of musical
examples or cases, and a philosophical sensibility attuned to the
conceptually clarifying role of particularity&mdash;both of which
Wittgenstein himself possessed to an extraordinarily high degree.</p>

<h3 id="PropEsse">1.1 Properties and Essence</h3>

<p>
It is also vividly apparent from the outset of his lectures on
aesthetics that Wittgenstein is urging a heightened vigilance to the
myriad ways in which words that function aesthetically can, on their
grammatical surface, mislead. If, right at the beginning of an inquiry
into the features of a work of music that most captivate us, we see
that we use the word &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; as an adjective, we may
well very shortly find ourselves asking what is the essence of the
<em>property</em> beauty that this particular case exhibits. This, in
microcosm, is indicative of the larger Wittgensteinian approach:
rather than moving from a particular case in front of us to a general
or universal issue believed to be conceptually residing above it, we
turn from the particular to the ever more particular. That is, by
analogy, we move from the magnifying glass not to the telescope, but
to the microscope. This kind of redirection is present throughout his
writings on language, on mind, on perception, and indeed here on
aesthetic perception and understanding. Imagining a book of philosophy
investigating parts of speech (but very many more parts than we find
in an ordinary grammar book) in which we would give very detailed and
nuanced attention to &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;, &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;,
along with other verbs of personal experience, and equally lengthy
studies of &ldquo;all&rdquo;, &ldquo;any&rdquo;, &ldquo;some&rdquo;,
numerals, first person pronoun usages, and so forth, he suggests that
such a book would, with sufficient attention paid to the contextual
intricacies of the grammar of each usage, lay bare the confusions into
which language can lead us&mdash;where the way out of those confusions
is always to move in the direction of detail, not generality. Later,
in his <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (1958, 2009), he will go
on to develop the analogy between tools and language as a way of
breaking the hold of the conceptual picture that words work in one way
(by naming things&mdash;including the naming of properties, as in the
way we too-quickly think of the problem of beauty above), showing the
extensive diversity of <em>kind</em> and of <em>use</em> among the
various things we find in the tool box (e.g., hammer, glue, chisel,
matches). If we redirect our attention, away from the <em lang="fr">id&eacute;e
fixe</em> of the puzzle concerning the common
property named by the word &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; or the description
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, and look to the actual use to which our
aesthetic-critical vocabulary is put, we will see that it is not some
intrinsic meaning carried internally by the linguistic sign (BB:
4&ndash;12) that makes the word in question function as an aesthetic
or critical interjection or expression of approval. We will, rather,
be able to focus our redirected attention on what actually does make
the word in question function aesthetically, i.e., &ldquo;on the
enormously complicated situation in which the aesthetic expression has
a place&rdquo;. And he adds that, with such an enlarged vision, we
will see that &ldquo;the expression itself has almost a negligible
place&rdquo; (BB: 2). He here mentions (seeing aesthetic issues as
interwoven with the rest of philosophy) that if he had to identify the
main mistake made in philosophical work of his generation, it would be
precisely that of, when looking at language, focusing on the form of
words, and not the use made of the form of words. He will go on to
imply, if not quite to directly assert, that the parallel holds to the
work of art: what we need, against contrary and methodologically
entrenched intellectual impulses, is to see that work of art within a
larger frame of reference, to see it in comparison to other works of
the artist in question, and to see it juxtaposed with still other
works from its cultural context. Taken together, this is to see what
role the work of art played in the dialogically unfolding artistic
 &ldquo;language-game&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 of its time and place. In using language, he says next in the
lectures, in understanding each other&mdash;and in mastering a
language initially&mdash;we do not start with a small set of words or
a single word, but rather we start from specific occasions and
activities. Our aesthetic engagements are occasions and activities of
precisely this kind; thus aesthetics, as a field of conceptual
inquiry, should for Wittgenstein start not from a presumption that the
central task is to analyze the determinant properties that are named
by aesthetic predicates, but rather from a full-blooded consideration
of the <em>activities</em> of aesthetic life. It is instructive in
this sense to consider the large number of musical experiences that
are documented in his own remarks as they are woven throughout all of
his life&rsquo;s writings and the frequent mentions of those
experiences in his correspondence with others and in the writings,
diaries, and notebooks of his close friends and companions (Pinsent
1990: passim); taken together, these give a good picture of the deep
well of musical and aesthetic experience from which Wittgenstein was
drawing. Reading these lectures, one can come away with the idea that
they are about, exclusively, his thoughts and remarks on aesthetics as
a sub-discipline of philosophy. They are not: they are, in fact and
beyond what they explicitly say, articulating an entire approach to
the philosophy of culture, our understanding and absorption of it, and
the way we cultivate a sensibility within it.</p>

<h3 id="PredRule">1.2 Predicates and Rules</h3>

<p>
But the adjectival form of many&mdash;not all&mdash;critical
predicates quickly reinforces the &ldquo;property-with-name&rdquo;
model, and against this Wittgenstein places examples from musical and
poetical criticism, where we simply call attention to the rightness of
a transition or to the precision or aptness of an image. And it is
here that Wittgenstein reminds us that descriptions such as
&ldquo;stately&rdquo;, &ldquo;pompous&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;melancholy&rdquo; (where the latter is said of a Schubert
piece) are like giving the work a face (see Shiner 1978), or we could
instead (or in further specification of such descriptions) use
 gestures.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 In cases of re-construing a work (e.g., resituating the emphases in
the meter of a poem as we read it) so that we understand its rhythm
and structure anew, we make gestures, facial expressions, and
non-descriptive-predicate based remarks, where aesthetic adjectives
play a diminished role&mdash;or no role at all. And we show our
approval of a tailor&rsquo;s work not by describing the suit, but by
wearing it. Wittgenstein&rsquo;s fundamental point here is that
occasions and activities are fundamental, descriptive language
secondary. In these lectures Wittgenstein needs more examples than he
gives (although he does give many throughout other writings), but one
could capture the point here by considering the example of a conductor
showing the thematic force of the opening of Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth
Symphony, and being fully understood by the orchestra, without ever
using the word &ldquo;forceful.&rdquo; Similarly, one can imagine
Morandi completing a painting, and that painting&rsquo;s distinctive
atmosphere being comprehended by viewers of it, without anyone ever
using the word &ldquo;timeless.&rdquo; Indeed, one might use those
words later, but the conveyed sense of the work is not invariably
dependent on a &ldquo;word first, then perception&rdquo; model of
aesthetic responsiveness. Aesthetic words can, of course, open avenues
of perception, but the implicit point at this stage in these lectures
is that the relations between words and perceptions are not reducible
to a uniform formula. Always aware of contextual variance,
Wittgenstein is reminding us that some cases, however uniform, do not
predict all cases.</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein turns to the subject of rules, and rule-following, in
aesthetic decision-making. This stems from his reflection on the word
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; in aesthetic discourse, and he mentions the case
of being drilled in harmony and counterpoint. Such rule-learning, he
claims, allows what he calls an interpretation of the rules in
particular cases, where an increasingly refined judgment comes from an
increasingly refined mastery of the rules in question. It is of
particular interest that a qualification is entered here, that such
rules in contexts of artistic creativity and aesthetic judgment,
&ldquo;may be extremely explicit and taught, or not formulated at
all&rdquo; (LA: 5 n. 3). This strongly suggests that, in this way too,
<em>actions</em> come first, where these actions may (to invoke
Kant&rsquo;s famous distinction) either explicitly follow from the
rule, or stand in accordance with them but (for Wittgenstein) in an
inexplicit way. The mastery of a practice can be, but need not be,
characterized as a cognitive matter of rule-following. Here we thus
find one of the points of intersection between Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
work in aesthetics and his work in the philosophy of language: the
rule-following considerations (Holtzman &amp; Leich 1981; McDowell
1998b) and the debate concerning non-cognitivism (McDowell 1998a) link
directly to this discussion. These issues also connect to questions
concerning creativity in language (where such creativity is often
aesthetic in nature) and how that form of creativity can cast light on
artistic creativity (Gr&egrave;ve &amp; M&aacute;cha [eds] 2016). This
in turns opens up another way of seeing the connection between the
arts, particularly music, and language: it is not necessarily only
that a theme must exhibit a linguistically expressive character for
the art-language analogy to hold, but also that the creativity that
occurs within spoken and written language may be parallel to the kinds
of creativity that manifest within the creative aesthetic imagination.
For one example, the creative flair that one finds in some works of
serial or twelve-tone composition (Hagberg 2011) can stand parallel to
the creativity one recognizes in a poet working within the constraints
of a rhyme scheme, or on a broader scale, a novelist finding an
inventive way of putting words together while still working inside the
constraints of coherence-preserving syntax.</p>

<p>
Regrettably, Wittgenstein closes this matter prematurely (somewhat
implausibly claiming that this issue should not come in at this
point); the linkage between rule-following in language and in
aesthetics is still to this day too little investigated. Yet there is
a sense in which Wittgenstein extends the discussion, if only
implicitly. In investigating the kinds of things meant by aesthetic
&ldquo;appreciation&rdquo;, he does say that &ldquo;an appreciator is
not shown by the interjections he uses&rdquo; but rather by his
choices, selections, and his actions on specific occasions. To
describe what appreciation consists in, he claims, would prove an
impossibility, for &ldquo;to describe what it consists in we would
have to describe the whole environment&rdquo; (LA: 7), and he returns
to the case of the tailor&mdash;and thus implicitly to rule-following.
Such rules, as we discern them in action ranging on a continuum from
the cognitively-explicit and linguistically encapsulated to the
non-cognitively implicit and only behaviorally manifested, have a
life&mdash;have an identity as rules&mdash;within, and <em>only</em>
within, those larger contexts of engagement, those &ldquo;whole
environment[s]&rdquo;. And those environments, those contexts, those
language-games, are not reducible to a unitary kind which we then
might analyze for essential properties: &ldquo;correctness&rdquo;, for
example, plays a central role in some cases of aesthetic appreciation
and understanding, and it is irrelevant in others, e.g., in
garment-cutting versus Beethoven symphonies, or in domestic
architecture versus the Gothic cathedral. And he explicitly draws, if
too briefly, the analogy that emerges here between ethics and
aesthetics: he notes the difference between saying of a person that he
behaves well versus saying that a person made a great or profound
impression. Indeed, &ldquo;the entire <em>game</em> is
different&rdquo; (LA: 8). It is important to see here that, for
Wittgenstein, the relation between aesthetics and ethics is not
additive in character, that is, it is not that one first has a
hermetically sealed aesthetic act and then one superadds ethical
content to it, or one layers over it merely superadded ethical
content. Rather, the ethical and the aesthetic are for Wittgenstein
intertwined from the outset, where ethical content may be integral to
the aesthetic act from its inception and inseparable from the context
within which that aesthetic act has its meaning, its life. And so
aesthetic descriptions and the language we use to interact with, to
appreciate, to understand, or to create works of art may intrinsically
house ethical aspects, just as our ethical language may inseparably
interweave aesthetic aspects.</p>

<h3 id="CultComp">1.3 Culture and Complexity</h3>

<p>
The central virtue of these lectures is that Wittgenstein never loses
a sense of the <em>complexity</em> of our aesthetic engagements, our
language attending those engagements, and the contextually embedded
nature of the aesthetic actions he is philosophically working to
elucidate. Nor does he lose a sense of the relation&mdash;a relation
necessary to the meaning of the aesthetic language we
use&mdash;between the aesthetically-descriptive expressions we employ
within highly particularized contexts and the much larger intellectual
and cultural atmosphere surrounding those contexts, &ldquo;what we
call the culture of the period&rdquo; (LA: 8). Of those aesthetic
words, he says, &ldquo;To describe their use or to describe what you
mean by a cultured taste, you have to describe a culture&rdquo; (LA:
8). That is, the one resides within the other. And once again making
the relation between his work in the philosophy of language and his
work in the philosophy of art explicit (if again too briefly), he
adds, &ldquo;What belongs to a language game is a whole culture&rdquo;
(LA: 8). And here the link to the irreducible character of
rule-following is made once again as well: &ldquo;To describe a set of
aesthetic rules fully means really to describe the culture of a
period&rdquo; (LA: 8, n. 3). If our aesthetic engagements and the
interrelated uses of our aesthetic terms are widely divergent and
context-sensitive, so are our aesthetic actions and vocabularies
context-sensitive in a larger sense or within a larger frame as well:
comparing a cultured taste of <em lang="fr">fin-de-siecle</em> Vienna
or early-twentieth-century Cambridge with the Middle Ages, he
says&mdash;implicitly referring to the radically divergent
constellations of meaning-associations from one age to the other,
&ldquo;An entirely different game is played in different ages&rdquo;
(LA: 8). Of a generic claim made about a person that he or she
appreciates a given style or genre of art, Wittgenstein makes it clear
that he would not yet know&mdash;stated in that generic,
case-transcending way&mdash;not merely whether it was true or not, but
more interestingly and more deeply, what it <em>meant</em> to say
this. The word &ldquo;appreciates&rdquo; is, like the rest of our
aesthetic vocabulary, not detachable from the particular context
within which it has its
 life.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 If, against this diversity or context-sensitivity, we seek to find
and then analyze what all such cases of aesthetic engagement have in
common, we might well focus on the <em>word</em>
&ldquo;appreciation&rdquo;. But that word will not have meaning with a
bounded determinacy that is fixed prior to its contextualized
use&mdash;which means that we would find ourselves, because of this
philosophical strategy (recall he claimed that the entire field
&ldquo;is very big and entirely misunderstood&rdquo;), in a double
bind: first, we would not know the meaning of the term upon which we
were focusing; and second, we would, in trying to locate what all
cases of aesthetic engagement have in common, leave out of view what
he calls in this connection &ldquo;an immensely complicated family of
cases&rdquo; (LA: 10), blinding ourselves to nuance and complexity in
the name of a falsifying neatness and overarching generality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In order to get clear about aesthetic words you have to describe ways
of living. We think we have to talk about aesthetic judgments like
&ldquo;This is beautiful&rdquo;, but we find that if we have to talk
about aesthetic judgments, we don&rsquo;t find these words at all, but
a word used something like a gesture, accompanying a complicated
activity. (LA: 11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reference to gesture is illuminating, because a gesture is
relationally constituted, that is, the significance of any given
gesture is determined by the context of its usage. Waving one&rsquo;s
arm, for example, can have a hundred different meanings depending on
what the waving is for, what its pragmatic force is. The idea that all
arm wavings must have the same meaning because they are physically
indistinguishable from context to context is not only obviously and
glaringly false. It is also an idea that would systematically omit
everything of communicative interest. For Wittgenstein, the
innumerable words of aesthetic appreciation and artistic creativity
function in the same deeply contextualized, pragmatic, and
culture-saturated way.</p>

<h2 id="CritScie">2. The Critique of Scientism</h2>

<p>
Wittgenstein turns to the idea of a science of aesthetics, an idea for
which he has precious little sympathy (&ldquo;almost too ridiculous
for words&rdquo; [LA: 11]). But as is often the case in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s philosophical work, it does not follow from this
scornful or dismissive attitude that he has no interest in the
etiology of the idea, or in excavating the hidden steps or components
of thought that have led some to this idea. Often in his philosophical
work, verifying or falsifying an idea is the easier part;
understanding in conceptually-microscopic detail how one might be led
into the idea is for him both far more demanding and far more
interesting. In the ensuing discussion he unearths a picture of
causation that under-girds the very idea of a scientific explanation
of aesthetic judgment or preference. And in working underground in
this way, he reveals the analogies to cases of genuine scientific
explanation, where the &ldquo;tracing of a mechanism&rdquo; just is
the process of giving a causal account, i.e., where the observed
effect is described as the inevitable result of prior links in the
causal chain leading to it. If, to take his example, an architect
designs a door and we find ourselves in a state of discontentment
because the door, within the larger design of the fa&ccedil;ade
(within its stylistic &ldquo;language-game&rdquo;, we might say), is
too low, we are liable to describe this on the model of scientific
explanation. Then, we make a substantive of the discontent, see it as
the causal result of the lowness of the door, and in identifying the
lowness as the cause, think ourselves able to dislodge the inner
entity, the discontent, by raising the door. Some might see this
reduction to a simple cause-and-effect model (indeed many modern
experimental-psychological studies of aesthetic responses are based on
this model) as conceptual clarification, but in truth this only
mischaracterizes our real aesthetic reactions, or what we might call,
by analogy to moral psychology, our actual aesthetic psychology.</p>

<h3 id="AestReac">2.1 Aesthetic Reactions</h3>

<p>
The true aesthetic reaction&mdash;itself rarely described <em>in
situ</em> in terms of a proximate cause (&ldquo;In these cases the
word &lsquo;cause&rsquo; is hardly ever used at all&rdquo; [LA: 14])
is far more immediate, and far more intertwined with, and related to,
what we see
 in<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 the work of art in question. &ldquo;It is a reaction analogous to my
taking my hand away from a hot plate&rdquo; (LA: 14). He thus
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To say: &ldquo;I feel discomfort and know the cause&rdquo;, is
entirely misleading because &ldquo;know the cause&rdquo; normally
means something quite different. How misleading it is depends on
whether when you said: &ldquo;I know the cause&rdquo;, you meant it to
be an explanation or not. &ldquo;I feel discomfort and know the
cause&rdquo; makes it sound as if there were two things going on in my
soul&mdash;discomfort and knowing the cause. (LA: 14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But there is, as he next says, a &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; to such a case of
aesthetic discomfort, if not a cause (on the conventional
simplified-scientific, cause-and-effect model). But both the question
and its multiform answers can take significantly different forms in
different cases. Again, if what he suggested before concerning the
importance of context for the determination of meaning is correct, the
very <em>meaning</em> of the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;-question will vary
case to case. It is important to note that this is not a weaker thesis
concerning variation on the level of inflection, where the underlying
structure of the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;-question is causal. No, here again
that unifying, model-imposing manner of proceeding would leave out a
consideration of the nuances that give the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;-question
its determinate sense in the first place. The meaning of the
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; question, indeed like the meaning of the word
&ldquo;why&rdquo;, is not invariant across differing contexts and
cases of its employment. Similarly, the criteria to which we appeal in
any such particular case will not prove invariant either. And of his
phrase, &ldquo;makes it sound as if there were two things going on in
my soul&rdquo;, the discomfort as one psychic entity, and the
knowledge of the cause as another: that bifurcation does invite the
causal model, and it invites a question about the relation between the
two psychic entities along with a correlative explanatory system that
would try to explain mental states and responses in the way we explain
the interactions of billiard balls. The model, Wittgenstein sees here,
can be inviting for its simplicity and uniformity across
cases&mdash;but it either oversimplifies or falsifies our actual
experienced mental phenomenology.</p>

<p>
But again, Wittgenstein&rsquo;s fundamental concern here is to point
out the great conceptual gulf that separates aesthetic perplexities
from the methodology of empirical psychology. To run studies of
quantified responses to controlled and isolated aesthetic stimuli,
where emergent patterns of preference, response, and judgment are
recorded within a given population&rsquo;s sample, is to pass by the
true character of the aesthetic issue: the actual puzzlement
concerning an aesthetic response or reaction, if we feel such
puzzlement, will be conceptual, not empirical. And so here again we
see a direct link between his lectures on aesthetics and his far more
extensive work in the philosophy of psychology: the penultimate
passage of Part II of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (PI: II,
&sect;xiv), was</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the
means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and
method pass one another by. (PI: II, iv, 232)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He says, near the close of this part of his lectures on
aesthetics,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Aesthetic questions have nothing to do with psychological experiments,
but are answered in an entirely different way. (LA: 17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A stimulus-response model adapted from scientific
psychology&mdash;what we might in our present period call the
naturalizing of aesthetics&mdash;falsifies the genuine complexities of
aesthetic psychology through a methodologically enforced reduction to
one narrow and unitary conception of aesthetic engagement. For
Wittgenstein, it is a nuanced grasp of relevant particularity and
complexity, and not reduction to a presumed unitary essence, that
paves the way to genuine conceptual clarification. Reduction to a
simplified model, by contrast, yields only the illusion of
clarification in the form of conceptual incarceration (&ldquo;a
picture held us
 captive&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ClicCohe">2.2 The &ldquo;Click&rdquo; of Coherence</h3>

<p>
Aesthetic satisfaction, for Wittgenstein, is an experience that is
only possible within a culture and where the reaction that constitutes
aesthetic satisfaction or justification is both more immediate, and
vastly larger and more expansive, than any simple mechanistic account
could accommodate. It is more immediate in that it is not usually
possible to specify in advance the exact conditions required to
produce the satisfaction, or, as he discusses it, the
&ldquo;click&rdquo; when everything falls into place. Such exacting
pre-specifications for satisfaction are possible in narrowly
restricted empirical cases where, for example, we wait for two
pointers in a vision examination to come into a position directly
opposite each other. And this, Wittgenstein says, is the kind of
simile we repeatedly use, but misleadingly, for in truth &ldquo;really
there is nothing that clicks or that fits anything&rdquo; (LA: 19).
The satisfaction is more immediate, then, than the causal-mechanistic
model would imply. And it is much broader than the causal-mechanistic
model implies or could accommodate as well: there is no direct
aesthetic analogue to the matched pointers in the case of a larger and
deeper form of aesthetic gratification. Wittgenstein does, of course,
allow that there are very narrow, isolated circumstances within a work
where we do indeed have such empirical pre-specifiable conditions for
satisfaction (e.g., where in a piece of music we see that we wanted to
hear a minor ninth, and not a minor seventh, chord). But, contrary to
the empirical-causal account, these will not add up, exhaustively or
without significant remainder, to the experience of aesthetic
satisfaction. The problem, to which Wittgenstein repeatedly returns in
these lectures, is with the <em>kind</em> of answer we want to
aesthetic puzzlement as expressed in a question like &ldquo;Why do
these bars give me such a peculiar impression?&rdquo; (LA: 20) In such
cases, statistical results regarding percentages of subjects who
report this peculiar impression rather than another one in precisely
these harmonic, rhythmic, and melodic circumstances are not so much
impossible as just beside the point; the <em>kind</em> of question we
have here is not met by such methods.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The sort of explanation one is looking for when one is puzzled by an
aesthetic impression is not a causal explanation, not one corroborated
by experience or by statistics as to how people react&hellip;. This is
not what one means or what one is driving at by an investigation into
aesthetics. (LA: 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is all too easy to falsify, under the influence of explanatory
models misappropriated from what is itself an oversimplified
conception of science, the many and varied kinds of things that happen
when, aesthetically speaking, everything seems to click or fall into
place. Although this may seem at first glance a fairly circumscribed
point, i.e., that an oversimplifying model of cause-and-effect
relations misappropriated from experimental empirical psychology is
misleading, it is actually a quite large point, for it reorients our
expectations concerning how questions of aesthetic experience and
aesthetic responses should be both asked and answered.</p>

<h3 id="CharRedu">2.3 The Charm of Reduction</h3>

<p>
In the next passages of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s lectures, he turns to a
fairly detailed examination of the distinct charm, for some, of
psycho-analytic explanation, and he interweaves this with the
distinction between scientific-causal explanation of an action versus
motive-based (or personally-generated) explanations of that action. It
is easy, but mistaken, to read these passages as simply
subject-switching anticipations of his lectures on Freud to follow.
But his fundamental interest here lies with the powerful charm, a kind
of conceptual magnetism, of reductive explanations that promise a
brief, compact, and propositionally-encapsulated account of what some
much larger field of thought or action &ldquo;really&rdquo; is. (He
cites the example of boiling Redpath, one of his auditors, down to
ashes, and then saying &ldquo;This is all Redpath really is&rdquo;,
adding the remark &ldquo;Saying this might have a certain charm, but
would be misleading to say the least&rdquo; (LA: 24). &ldquo;To say
the least&rdquo; indeed: the example is striking precisely because one
can feel the attraction of an encapsulating and simplifying reduction
of the bewildering and monumental complexity of a human being, while
at the same time feeling, as a human being, that any such reduction to
a few physical elements would hardly capture the essence of a person.
Rather, it misses everything that is part and parcel of humanity
itself. This, he observes, is an explanation of the &ldquo;This is
only really this&rdquo; form. Reductive causal explanations function
in precisely the same way in aesthetics, and this links directly to
the problems in philosophical methodology that he adumbrated in the
<em>Blue and Brown Books</em> (BB: 17&ndash;19), particularly where he
discusses what he calls &ldquo;the craving for generality&rdquo; and
the attendant &ldquo;contemptuous attitude toward the particular
case&rdquo;. If the paradigm of the sciences (which themselves, as he
observes in passing, carry an imprimatur of epistemic prestige and the
image of incontrovertibility) is Newtonian mechanics, and we then
implant that model under our subsequent thinking about psychology, we
will almost immediately arrive at an idea of a science of the mind,
where that science would progress through the gradual accumulation of
psychological laws. (This would constitute, as he memorably puts it, a
&ldquo;mechanics of the soul&rdquo; [LA: 29]). With this background,
we then dream of a psychological science of aesthetics,
where&mdash;although &ldquo;we&rsquo;d not thereby have solved what we
feel to be aesthetic puzzlement&rdquo; (LA: 29)&mdash;we may find
ourselves able to predict (borrowing the criterion of predictive power
from science) what effect a given line of poetry, or a given musical
phrase, may have on a certain person whose reaction patterns we have
studied. This would be a science of art&rsquo;s power and of aesthetic
responses. But aesthetic puzzlement, again, is of a different
<em>kind</em>, and here he takes a major step forward, from the
critical to the constructive phase of his lectures. He writes,
&ldquo;What we really want, to solve aesthetic puzzlements, is certain
comparisons&mdash;grouping together of certain cases&rdquo; (LA: 29).
Such a method, such an approach, would never so much as occur to us
were we to remain both dazzled by the misappropriated model of
mechanics and contemptuous of the particular case. This too is of
fundamental importance in understanding aesthetic experience, because
the very concept of comparison shifts our attention from one
particular artifact or work to the relations between them; that is,
rather than assuming that everything that is to be seen in a work is
internally contained within that work, we look up and around&mdash;we
look at the work in a comparative-relational context. Properties and
qualities of works of art and music do not invariably display
themselves in an internally-bounded way. Often it is only by
comparative or cross-work consideration that some of those properties
or qualities emerge to a visible or audible degree. To focus our
attention exclusively on a single work unto itself in a bounded way is
often, against strictly formalistic intuitions or presuppositions, not
to see that work for what it is or all that it is.</p>

<h2 id="CompAppr">3. The Comparative Approach</h2>

<p>
Comparison, and the intricate process of grouping together certain
cases&mdash;where such comparative juxtaposition usually casts
significant features of the work or works in question in higher
relief, where it leads to the emergence of an organizational
 gestalt,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 where it shows the evolution of a style, or where it shows what is
strikingly original about a work, among many other things&mdash;also
focuses our attention on the particular case in another way. In
leading our scrutiny to critically and interpretatively relevant
particularities, it leads us away from the aesthetically blinding
presumption that it is the <em>effect</em>, brought about by the
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; of that particular work, that matters (so that any
minuet that gives a certain feeling or awakens certain images would do
as well as any other). Wittgenstein&rsquo;s point here speaks both of
his work in aesthetics and his approach to philosophical problems more
generally as we see it throughout <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em>: by giving sufficient attention to particulars,
the larger question that motivated our selection of the particular
case at hand in the first place begins to evaporate, due to what
gradually reveals itself to be a disorienting over-generality. It is
not so much that the particular case illustrates or answers the
general question, but rather that the focus on the
contextually-specific relevant details of the particular case
seriously challenge the intelligibility of that over-general
question.</p>

<h3 id="CritReas">3.1 Critical Reasoning</h3>

<p>
These foregoing matters taken together lead to what is central to
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thoughts on aesthetics. In observing that on one
hearing of a minuet we may get a lot out of it and on the next hearing
nothing, he is showing how easy it can be to take conceptual missteps
in our aesthetic thought from which it can prove difficult to recover.
From such a difference, against how we can all too easily model the
matter, it does not follow that what we get out of the minuet is
<em>independent</em> of the minuet. That would constitute an
imposition of a Cartesian dualism between the two ontologies of mind
and matter, but in its aesthetic guise. And that would lead in turn to
theories of aesthetic content of a mental kind, where the materials of
the art form (materials we would then call &ldquo;external&rdquo;
materials) only serve to carry the real, internal or non-physical
content. Criticism would thus be a process of arguing inferentially
from outward evidence back to inward content; creation would be a
process of finding outward correlates or carriers for that prior
inward content; and artistic intention would be articulated as a full
mental pre-conception of the contingently finished (or
&ldquo;externalized&rdquo;, as we would then call it) work. It is no
accident that Wittgenstein immediately moves to the analogy to
language and our all-too-easy misconception of linguistic meaning,
where we make &ldquo;the mistake of thinking that the meaning or
thought is just an accompaniment of the word, and the word
doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; (LA: 25). This indeed would prove
sufficient to motivate contempt for the particular case in aesthetic
considerations, by misleadingly modeling a dualistic vision of art
upon an equally misleading dualistic model of language (Hagberg 1995).
&ldquo;The sense of a proposition&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;is very
similar to the business of an appreciation of art&rdquo; (LA: 29).
This might also be called a subtractive model, and Wittgenstein
captures this perfectly with a question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A man may sing a song with expression and without expression. Then why
not leave out the song&mdash;could you have the expression then? (LA:
32 editorial note and footnote.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a model corresponds, again, to mind-matter Cartesian dualism,
which is a conceptual template that also, as we have just seen above,
manifests itself in the philosophy of language where we would picture
the thought as an inner event and the external word or sign to which
it is arbitrarily attached as that inner event&rsquo;s outward
corresponding physicalization. It is no surprise that, in this
lecture, he turns directly to false and imprisoning pictures of this
dualism in linguistic meaning, and then back to the aesthetic case.
When we contemplate the expression of a drawn face, it is deeply
misleading&mdash;or deeply misled, if the dualistic picture of
language stands behind this template-conforming thought&mdash;to ask
for the expression to be given without the face. &ldquo;The
expression&rdquo;&mdash;now linking this discussion back to the
previous causal considerations &mdash; &ldquo;is not an
<em>effect</em> of the face&rdquo;. The template of cause-and-effect,
and of a dualism of material and expressive content (on the
subtractive model), and the construal of the material work of art as a
<em>means</em> to the production of a separately-identifiable
intangible, experiential <em>end,</em> are all out of place here. On
such a model, the materials of art are mere delivery vehicles, with
the valuable content&mdash;of a differing ontological order&mdash;the
abstract target of our aesthetic attention. All of the examples
Wittgenstein gives throughout these lectures combat these false
pictures, each in their own way. And so, this too connects
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thinking in aesthetics to his much larger
philosophical project: examples are not illustrations of
pre-identified philosophical content. Rather, they reveal what we
might have missed on a more abstract level; they possess the power to
direct the inquiry and not merely illustrate it; and they make visible
the practices, the contexts, that give our words meaning and point. In
his lectures here, we see that this is true of our aesthetic words,
our vocabulary of appreciation and interpretation. In his more
expansive philosophical inquiries, we see that this is true of words
concerning the mind, concerning language, concerning
action-description, and concerning philosophical methodology itself.
Each example&mdash;in music, in visual art, in architecture, in music,
and in literature and poetry, serves this purpose, just as do examples
in his writings on language, mind, rule-following, intention,
mathematics, certainty, and so forth.</p>

<p>
But then Wittgenstein&rsquo;s examples in the arts also work in
concert: they together argue against a form of aesthetic reductionism
that would pretend that our reactions to aesthetic objects are
isolable, that they can be isolated as variables within a controlled
experiment, that they can be hermetically sealed as the experienced
effects of isolatable causes. He discusses our aesthetic reactions to
subtle differences between differently drawn faces, and our equally
subtle reactions to the height or design of a door (he is known to
have had the ceiling in an entire room of the house in Vienna he
designed for his sister moved only a few inches when the builders
failed to realize his plan with sufficient exactitude). The enormous
subtlety, and the enormous complexity, of these reactions, are a part
of&mdash;and are as complicated as&mdash;our natural history. He gives
as an example the error, or the crudeness, of someone responding to a
complaint concerning the depiction of a human smile (specifically,
that the smile did not seem genuine), with the reply that, after all,
the lips are only parted one one-thousandths of an inch too much: such
differences, however small in <em>measure</em>, in truth matter
enormously. His architecture for his sister shows this; his intricate
and intimate responsiveness to the arts and especially to music show
this; and his entire philosophy of language shows this.</p>

<h3 id="SeeiConn">3.2 Seeing Connections</h3>

<p>
Beneath Wittgenstein&rsquo;s examples, as developed throughout these
lectures, lies another interest (which presses its way to the surface
and becomes explicit on occasion): he is eager to show the
significance of making connections in our perception and understanding
of art works&mdash;connections between the style of a poet and that of
a composer (e.g., Keller and Brahms), between one musical theme and
another, between one expressive facial depiction and another, between
one period of an artist&rsquo;s work and another. Such
connections&mdash;we might, reviving a term from first-generation
Wittgensteinians, refer to the kind of work undertaken to identify and
articulate such connections as &ldquo;connective
analysis&rdquo;&mdash;are, for Wittgenstein, at the heart of aesthetic
experience and aesthetic contemplation. And they again are of the kind
that reductive causal explanation would systematically miss. In
attempting to describe someone&rsquo;s feelings, could we do better
than to imitate the way the person actually said the phrase we found
emotionally revelatory, Wittgenstein pointedly asks? The
disorientation we would feel in trying to describe the person&rsquo;s
feeling with subtlety and precision <em>without</em> any possibility
of imitating his precise expressive utterance &mdash; &ldquo;the way
he said it&rdquo;&mdash;shows how very far the dualistic or
subtractive conceptual template is from our human experience, our
natural history, our mode and patterns of attention.</p>

<p>
Connections, of the kind alluded to here&mdash;a web of
variously-activated relations between the particular aspect of the
work to which we are presently attending and other aspects, other
parts of the work, or other works, groups of works, or other artists,
genres, styles, or other human experiences in all their
particularity&mdash;may include what we call associations awakened by
the work, but connections are not reducible to them only (and
certainly not to undisciplined, random, highly subjective, or free
 associations).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 The impossibility of the simplifying subtractive template emerges
here as well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose [someone says]: &ldquo;Associations are what
matter&mdash;change it slightly and it no longer has the same
associations&rdquo;. But can you separate the associations from the
picture, and have the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The answer is clearly, again like the case of singing with and then
without expression above, negative:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as good as the other: it
gives me the same associations&rdquo;. (LA: 34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here again, Wittgenstein shows the great gulf that separates what we
actually do with, what we actually say about, works of art, and how we
would speak of them <em>if</em> the conceptual pictures and templates
with which he has been doing battle were correct. To extend one of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s examples, we would very much doubt the aesthetic
discernment, and indeed the sympathetic imagination and the human
connectedness, of a person who said of two poems (each of which
reminded him of death) that either will do as well as the other to a
bereaved friend, that they would do the same thing (where this is
uttered in a manner dismissive of nuance, or as though it is being
said of two detergents). Poetry, Wittgenstein is showing, does not
play that kind of role in our lives, as the nature and character of
our critical verbal interactions about it indicate. And he ascends,
momentarily, to a remark that characterizes his underlying
philosophical methodology (or one dimension of it) in the philosophy
of language that is being put to use here within the context of his
lectures on aesthetics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If someone talks bosh, imagine the case in which it is not bosh. The
moment you imagine it, you see at once it is not like that in our
case. (LA: 34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gulf that separates what we should say if the generalizing
templates were accurate from what we in actual particularized cases do
say could further call into question not only the applicability or
accuracy, but indeed the very intelligibility or coherence, of the
language used to express those templates, those explanatory pictures.
Wittgenstein leaves that more aggressive, and ultimately more
clarifying and conceptually liberating, critique for his work on
language and mind in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> and other
writings, but one can see from these lectures alone how such an
aggressive critique might be undertaken.</p>

<p>
Also, the seeing of connections is often a matter of aspect-seeing, or
seeing-as (as Wittgenstein discusses in in <em>Philosophical
Investigations,</em> Part II, sec. xi). This is a discussion that he
begins with a contrast between two senses of the verb &ldquo;to
see&rdquo;, where in the first sense we see, for example, that a
drawing on the blackboard is of a smiling face. The second sense is
where we see a resemblance between two drawings of smiling faces on
the blackboard. One can point to what one sees in the first case in a
way that one cannot in the second; that is, while the recognition of
the face does not call for connective or relational perception, the
discernment of similarity between the two does. This part of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s work has been discussed at some length (Kemp
&amp; Mras [eds] 2016), and these issues are often rightly taken to be
central to his larger conception of aesthetic perception and
understanding.</p>

<h3 id="AttiTowaWorkArt">3.3 The Attitude Toward the Work of Art</h3>

<p>
Near the end of his lectures Wittgenstein turns to the question of the
attitude we take toward the work of art. He employs the case of seeing
the very slight change (of the kind mentioned above) in the depiction
of a smile within a picture of a monk looking at a vision of the
Virgin Mary. Where the slight and subtle change of line yields a
transformation of the smile of the monk from a kindly to an ironic
one, our attitude in viewing might similarly change from one in which
for some we are almost in prayer to one that would for some be
blasphemous, where we are almost leering. He then gives voice to his
imagined reductive interlocutor, who says, &ldquo;Well there you are.
It is all in the attitude&rdquo; (LA: 35), where we would then focus,
to the exclusion of all of the rest of the intricate, layered, and
complex human dimensions of our reactions to works, solely on an
analysis of the attitude of the spectator and the isolable causal
elements in the work that determine it. But that, again, is only to
give voice to a reductive impulse, and in the brief ensuing discussion
he shows, once again, that in some cases, an attitude of this kind may
emerge as particularly salient. But in other cases, not. And he shows,
here intertwining a number of his themes from these lectures, that the
very idea of &ldquo;a description of an attitude&rdquo; is itself no
simple thing. Full-blooded human beings, and not
stimulus-response-governed automata, have aesthetic experience, and
that experience is as complex a part of our natural history as any
other serious mode of human engagement.</p>

<p>
The complexity of the perceiving mind in aesthetic experience has been
discussed with increasing frequency in recent years (Gibson &amp;
Huemer [eds] 2004; Bru, Huemer, &amp; Steuer [eds] 2013); the emphasis
placed on this by Wittgenstein, across a broad range of individual
comments in his writings, has broken up the simplifying picture of a
monolithic or standardized perceptual experience that we all have in
common in, say, looking at a painting or listening to a piece of music
or reading a poem or novel. For Wittgenstein, the sensibility of the
viewer, listener, or reader is one essential part of what is required
to fully understand the depth and complexity of aesthetic experience
and its role in human life. Just as Wittgenstein said above that what
we might initially think of as an isolated case of aesthetic
perception or experience can only be truly seen within the larger
frame of a culture, so here we see him emphasizing that we can only
describe a moment of aesthetic interpretation by seeing it within the
larger frame of a sensibility.</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein ends the lectures discussing a simple heading: &ldquo;the
craving for simplicity&rdquo; (LA: 36). To such a mind, he says, if an
explanation is complicated, it is disagreeable for that very reason. A
certain kind of mind will insist on seeking out the single, unitary
essence of the matter, where&mdash;much like Russell&rsquo;s atomistic
search for the essence of the logic of language beneath what he
regarded as its misleadingly and distractingly variegated
surface&mdash;the reductive impulse would be given free reign. A
traditional reading of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s early work in the
<em>Tractatus</em> (1921/1922) claims that in that early work he
followed in that reductive/analytic vein (although there has emerged
more recently an alternative interpretation of that early work that
brings out the connections between that and his later work from
<em>The Blue Book</em> forward). In any case, in these lectures,
delivered in 1938, we see a profound philosophical mind that has
worked itself free from oversimplifying templates, from reductive
conceptual pictures. Here, as in all of his work from this point
forward, examples <em>themselves</em> do a good deal of philosophical
work, and their significance is that they <em>give</em>, rather than
merely illustrate, the philosophical point at hand. He said, earlier
in these lectures, that he is trying to teach a new way of thinking
about aesthetics&mdash;and indeed about philosophy itself.</p>

<p>
The subject of aesthetics, as he said in his opening line, is to his
way of seeing both very big and entirely misunderstood. It is very big
in its scope&mdash;in the reach of the aesthetic dimension throughout
human life. But we can now, at the end of his lectures on aesthetics,
see that it is a big subject in other senses too: aesthetics is
conceptually expansive in its important linkages to the philosophy of
language, to the philosophy of mind, to ethics, and to other areas of
philosophy, and it resists encapsulation into a single, unifying
problem. It is a multi-faceted, multi-aspected human cultural
phenomenon where connections, of diverging kinds, are more in play
than causal relations. The form of explanation we find truly
satisfying will thus strikingly diverge from the form of explanation
in science&mdash;the models of explanation in <em lang="de">Naturwissenschaften</em>
are misapplied in <em lang="de">Geisteswissenschaften,</em>
and the viewing of the latter
through the lens of the former will yield reduction, exclusion, and
ultimately distortion. The humanities are thus, for Wittgenstein, in
this sense autonomous.</p>

<h2 id="AestSignLateWrit">4. The Aesthetic Significance of the Later Writings</h2>

<p>
Again, the aesthetic dimension of life was, for Wittgenstein, nothing
less than fundamental to what it means to live the life of a human
being, and throughout his writings that extend far beyond his lectures
explicitly on aesthetics, we see continuous reflections on and
connections to the arts, music, and aesthetic experience. And these
remarks move varyingly in two directions: some move from a
philosophical point or observation concerning linguistic usage, mind,
or meaning, to an example in the arts that shows that point or
observation in aesthetic form; one would naturally expect this. But as
often, or perhaps more often, Wittgenstein perhaps less expectedly
moves in the other direction, employing a case from the arts and our
experience of them to the parallel or related philosophical point;
that is, he learns from an example in the arts first and then applies
that to, or assesses the implications of, that example or case for the
conceptual clarification of philosophical issues concerning language,
mind, and meaning. Then in addition, his later writings often hold
quite deep significance for aesthetics, if not directly stated.</p>

<h3 id="BlueBookMeanArts">4.1 The <em>Blue Book</em>, Meaning, and the Arts</h3>

<p>
This compact book opens with the question, &ldquo;What is the meaning
of a word?&rdquo; (BB: 1), and in it Wittgenstein quickly shows that
he is combatting a reductive impulse that would oversimplify the
conception of meaning and reduce it to a conceptually neat model (one
version of suggests that meaning is reducible to ostensive definition,
to the direct relation between a word as a name the thing to which
that name refers) that would see context-invariance as a virtue (where
Wittgenstein sees it to be a blinding simplification that misses far
more than it captures). What we see here is that it would prove
impossible for Wittgenstein (or for that matter anyone) to both
command the rich, subtle, and perception-shaping vocabulary that we
bring to our engagement with and in the arts and subscribe to any such
reductive model. Wittgenstein repeatedly reminds us of the way words
actually work in contexts of human interaction, and he insists that
the road to conceptual clarity is to accept, and ever further explore,
the true complexity of that rather than proceeding on the assumption
that there must be a hidden essence of word-meaning lying beneath all
the variability on when we then will think of as its surface. One can
see in these pages an excavation and removal of the presuppositions of
positivism, the view that would reduce ethical and aesthetic language
to either meaningless verbiage or mere emotive expressions that are
neither true nor false. Here, indeed, Wittgenstein is moving from the
observable intricacies of our verbal practices&mdash;our life in
language&mdash;to philosophy, and part of that lesson for the broader
philosophy of language of course applies with equal force to our
aesthetic language. What he shows as he progresses here is that the
plausibility of any reductive conception of meaning diminishes as our
grasp of the particularities of actual usage increases.</p>

<p>
One conception that is both implicitly and explicitly critiqued in
this book is that of atomism&mdash;basically the idea that a sentence
is composed of independently-meaningful word-units, and so that the
meaning of a sentence is an additive combination of those
&ldquo;atoms&rdquo; (BB: 2&ndash;7). Here he interweaves his
discussion with the analogous musical case: a coherent melody is quite
evidently not a mere concatenation of notes, no more than a coherent
sentence is a &ldquo;word salad&rdquo; or a mere concatenation of
isolated words. Indeed, the very idea of &ldquo;adding up&rdquo; notes
to see what melody those atom-notes create strains
coherence&mdash;this model is so foreign to our experience of musical
comprehension and melodic sense-making that the concept of adding-up
as applied to thematic sense in music seems like a category mistake.
Simply put, we see here that neither linguistic nor melodic
understanding work like that; the same point could be made concerning
individual brushstrokes and a painting.</p>

<p>
Another aspect of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s work in this book holding
immediate relevance for our understanding of the arts and aesthetic
experience is his discussion of the question of what he here calls the
sign and its life, in effect the word and its meaning. He shows how
powerfully misleading a dualistic schema can become when we structure
questions of meaning upon it, that is, how easily we can misconstrue
what we take to be incontrovertible facts of the case by assuming from
the outset that the &ldquo;life-giving&rdquo; content of a sign, a
word, will be prior mental or intentional content on the part of a
speaker or writer (BB: 4&ndash;7). On that classic mind/matter
dichotomy, the ultimate determinant of meaning would invariably be
pre-verbal cognition, and our model of correct interpretation would
then follow accordingly. That is, ultimately correct or perfect
interpretation would then be an exact recovery of private mental
content, and any movement along a continuum of interpretation ranging
from right to wrong would be determined by that interpretation&rsquo;s
degree of intentional retrieval. Throughout the <em>Blue Book</em>
Wittgenstein carefully dismantles this dualistic model, showing both
the power of its initial intuitive plausibility and its instructive
failure to correspond to the phenomenological experience of working
with and living within language. In that real language words interact
in something analogous to chemical ways, they prove to be inflected
and are in some cases transformed by context, they seem to dissolve
into each other in a way that makes the atomistic model seem strangely
scientistic, they creatively extend what we might have thought of as
the bounds of sense, and they carry ranges of implication that are not
contained within explicit intentional content and yet that are after
the fact acknowledged by a speaker or writer as part of what they
meant. The parallel for the arts is evident: if we construe the work
of an artist in dualistic terms with mind preceding matter, then we
picture the artistic intention as a full prefiguration of the
resultant artwork&mdash;which is then seen as a contingent
materialization of the prior cognitive content. Here again, any
question of meaning will be referred to that content, and any question
of interpretation will be judged by the extent to which it retrieves
work-preceding intentional content (BB: 7&ndash;17). All of this is
deeply misled: as non-dualistic aestheticians have suggested following
the influence of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s work, a great deal of creative
thinking takes place in and with the materials of art, and intentional
content is thus not, or not exclusively, a matter of pre-materiality
cognition. And non-dualistically, two other facts of our practices
emerge as well: (1) artists can suddenly see connections that seem
implicit within the materials that are in a sense
&ldquo;waiting&rdquo; to be discovered by them and integrate those
connections into the work (e.g., the original Mozart scores show this,
where we see his quill return to, for example, measure 14 and cross
out and change that measure at the time he is writing measure 76
because of his sudden discernment of an internal thematic relation
between 14 and 76), and (2) the materials themselves can seem, as we
say in our evolved aesthetic language, to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to
themselves, to indicate to the artist where they &ldquo;want to
go&rdquo;. Conversation, writing, and thinking in words, are all like
this&mdash;and the arts are too. All of this comports with, and is in
a sense within the implication range, of what Wittgenstein is
uncovering in the <em>Blue Book</em>. For him, any theory of
bifurcated mental acts and cognitive content prior to
physical-material embodiment is to be in the grip of a radically
oversimplifying picture. What we do with words, and what we do with
the materials of art, are very different from what any such dualistic
model would predict (Hagberg 2016b, 2016c).</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein considers the example of a water-diviner saying
&ldquo;with this rod I feel in my hands that the water is five feet
below the ground&rdquo; (BB: 9&ndash;11). In terms of
internally-contained sentential elements, we understand every word and
the statement composed of them. And yet, the implications set in
motion by these words are strangely disorienting: at that more broadly
encompassing level, we do not understand. Aesthetic
understanding&mdash;for instance the understanding of the significance
and implications of a musical theme&mdash;functions at that higher,
broader level. A musical theme, a series of brushstrokes, a poetic
phrase, an architectural detail, a scene in film or theater, a
sculptural curvilinear gesture in steel, a frozen moment in
photography, can all exhibit artistic analogues of linguistic
implicature; what we understand is not contained within nor reducible
to those isolated elements. One way to express what Wittgenstein
frequently states throughout this book is that we are to a greater
extent speakers in language rather than speakers of language; that is,
it is the complexly webbed relations of our words that make them what
they are, and we can see much the same when considering both works of
art, our reactions to them, and our lives with them.</p>

<p>
Throughout the <em>Blue Book</em>, Wittgenstein identifies, and
unearths the presuppositions in support of, what he calls the
&ldquo;contemptuous attitude toward the particular case.&rdquo;
Mistakenly believing that attitude to be methodologically appropriate
for a philosophical analysis aiming, for example, at a
trans-historical and universalized account of linguistic meaning, we
find ourselves blinded to the specificities of particular linguistic
contexts&mdash;from the level of a culture all the way down to an
individual, that determine how meaning functions in that time, in that
place, with those persons. An over-general account of meaning
throughout the arts would make the parallel mistake. By contrast, an
enriched comprehension of the nuanced particular, as it displays
meaning-generating internal and external relations, will capture
meaning <em>in situ</em>&mdash;for Wittgenstein, the only place that
meaning exists (BB: 27&ndash;44).</p>

<h3 id="PhilInveMindArts">4.2 <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, the Mind, and the Arts</h3>

<p>
For Wittgenstein, philosophy is an activity, and he shows this perhaps
most fully in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> than anywhere else
in his writings. This activity is carried out for him in a
self-interrogative manner, sustaining a heightened vigilance
concerning the misleading powers of hidden presuppositions, conceptual
&ldquo;pictures&rdquo; or simplifying templates, the intellectual
impulses that would lead us into polarized theories, false
dichotomies, and, as we&rsquo;ve seen in the <em>Blue Book</em>,
overgeneralizations and the &ldquo;contemptuous attitude.&rdquo; These
all manifest themselves in our answers to philosophical questions (as
one sees throughout his writings), but it is in <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em> that we see him most acutely assessing how these
misleading habits of the philosophical mind can manifest themselves
within the formulations of the questions themselves. Referring to
&ldquo;the multiplicity of language games&rdquo; (PI: sec. 24) that we
must keep in view (in this case concerning the practice of
questioning), Wittgenstein suggests that without the multiplicity of
our practices in view, we can be quickly motivated to ask questions
such as &ldquo;What is a question?&rdquo;, where the answer on that
level would apply to all particular cases. And without the parallel
mindfulness concerning the multiplicity of our artistic practices, we
can be quickly motivated to ask questions such as &ldquo;What is a
work of art?&rdquo;, where that answer is then expected to apply with
full explanatory power to narrower questions such as, &ldquo;What is a
work of music?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is a work of literature?&rdquo;.
His point, itself made in a multiplicity of ways that actually resist
reduction to a singular philosophical methodology, is that from this
altitude we cannot see the kinds of meaning-determining relations of
the kind mentioned just above in the <em>Blue Book</em>, and so like
understanding each word of the water-diviner but not understanding the
water-diviner, we can hear the words of these trans-contextual
questions, but whether we richly understand them is another issue.
Wittgenstein said that only aesthetic questions really gripped him;
whether this was true, given his work on language, the mind,
mathematics, certainty, and philosophical methodology, his point
concerned highly particularized aesthetic questions with a granny
particularity. To invent one such example, we might ask,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Why does that shaping of this four-measure melody, with the ascent
emphasized with a crescendo, have a slightly emerging quality of
smiling-through-tears that the same melody, emphasizing its descent,
does not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And for him, like questions of meaning in language, it is on this
level of specificity that we will experience aesthetic understanding
of a kind that is, indeed, gripping.</p>

<p>
Also, throughout this book we see a sustained engagement with the
intellectual impulses that would lead us into a mind/matter dualism
that, in the case of language, would lead us to see language as the
embodiment of cognitively prior and ontologically separable mental
content that is only contingently externalized. Actual language, by
contrast, is as much a part of our natural history as &ldquo;walking,
eating, drinking, playing&rdquo; (PI: sec. 25). One way to express
this point might be to say that many philosophers have treated
language as though we are in the first instance disembodied, and so
our language too comes from an immaterial, ghostly place that stands
prior to, and again separable from, any living breathing person or
groups of persons. The aesthetic parallel is evident: we would think
of artistic creativity in dualistic terms where pre-creative
ratiocination is the content, that is then only contingently made
manifest&mdash;and so the sole criterion for accurate interpretation
would be an attempt to get inside the head of the artist. But of the
mind-in-action, he shows that we can only understand cases of meaning
something, of willing, of intending, by situating those events into
actual contexts of their manifestations&mdash;and in such contexts we
do not &ldquo;read&rdquo; the manifestations as evidence for those
hidden mental acts (PI: secs. 1, 9, 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 41, 43, 120,
138, 139, 247, 532). Our perception and understanding of them do not
comport with a dualistic model (Hagberg 1986). And artistic acts of
creativity, of performance, of interpretation, do not conform to that
model either. Like being in language rather than being in a sense
behind it or using it as an externalizing tool from an inward
distance, so artists are in the materials of art, in a dialogical
creative interaction with those materials. And like words interacting,
opening lines of implication that may have been preconceived and may
not have been, so the materials of art have a life in the same way.
Unearthing dualistic models of the mind and of language, as
Wittgenstein does throughout <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>,
holds immediate significance for our understanding of what we might
call, emphasizing these parallels, the language of art.</p>

<p>
However, calling it that should not desensitize us to the fact that
one can see many places in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em> (and other writings) where the arts, and for him
particularly music, cast light onto our understanding of language (PI:
secs. 295, 401, 518, 520, 523, 527; Pt II, 35, 38, 45&ndash;49, 51,
168, 195, 209&ndash;210, 260, 267, 367). The street travels both ways.
Wittgenstein sees that what we might, from a higher perceptual
altitude, say that we have the same melody used by different
composers. That is, the same intervallic structure may be used, in the
same rhythmic figure. But he sees that there is not really a bounded
musical entity that is trans-contextually transplanted, because that
musical &ldquo;sentence&rdquo;, although internally structurally
identical, will have a different function, it will imply different
harmony, it will suggest different variations beyond it, and it will
thus convey a different sense. This is what he sees in music as
casting light on language: what we might call &ldquo;the same
sentence&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really that. Rather, the same sequence of
words may recur, but those words in differing contexts perform
different functions and deliver different services. The meaning of the
melody will invariably and inseparably be context-bound; the same is
true of (what we might call) the same sentence. The roles that they
play is the question; atomistic word-meaning or phrase-meaning is
instructively tone-deaf in both cases. Like a phrase in music, a
phrase in language can do many different things, and
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s sustained attentiveness to the inflection-power
of context brings this out in high relief in both art and language.
Melodies can assert, proclaim, question, answer, reinforce, look back,
promise, represent, motivate, show a way, develop an idea, establish a
mood, inflect a mood, change a mood, redirect attention, summarize,
expand upon, quietly close, and countless other things. All of the
arts develop variations on these, and taken <em lang="la">in toto</em>
they hold a great lesson for our understanding of what language is and
how it functions. In possession of a culturally refined sensibility
and the way that works of art &ldquo;speak to each other&rdquo;,
Wittgenstein sees this everywhere.</p>

<p>
In concert with the foregoing considerations, Wittgenstein in
<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> looks into the notion, the
concept, the idea, of thinking itself (PI: secs. 92&ndash;97, 110,
327&ndash;332, 339, 361, 383, 361, 574, 598, 686&ndash;690; Pt. II,
246, 248, 280, 281, 316&ndash;322). There is much to reflect upon in
connection with aesthetics in these remarks, but in brief on can say
that, consistent with his family-resemblance metaphor for general
classes (e.g., knowledge, truth, meaning, and we can add here art,
interpretation, and creativity), thinking does not have a single
essence that all cases of thinking share. And, again in concert with
the foregoing, just as speakers may think of what they are going to
say but they do so in language and not, as we have seen, before it, so
artists think in the materials of their artform and not before it.
Thinking is thus, in a doubled sense, embodied from the outset: it is
the thinking of a person in a context of inquiry, and it is a thinker
thinking in the materials of thought, that is, language. And so again,
the direct parallel in art presents itself: the thinking creator of
art, the thinking performer, the thinking poet, the thinking
conductor, etc., thinks in the materials that will manifest that
thought. So as language comes first, so the materials of art come
first in tandem. Wittgenstein speaks of the strength of Brahms&rsquo;s
melodic thought: this is a remark about the profundity of the thinking
Brahms undertook in both imagined sound and in actual sound at the
piano&mdash;that is, as imagined musical materials. And that is
evident in his work&mdash;and nowhere else. This connects directly to
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s critique of the idea of a metaphysically private
language, a language created wholly in a solipsistic interior, again
prior to and separate from any (what we then call) external expression
(PI: secs. 243&ndash;315). Language, he said, is the vehicle of
thought; the same is true in the arts. The privacy of mind, viewed as
sealed metaphysical interior, is for Wittgenstein (and after his work
on the mind and on the private language considerations, many others) a
philosophical myth. The artistic mind is no different. And so, what we
might call the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of a work of art is never
discoverable in isolation.</p>

<h3 id="PhilCult">4.3 The Philosophy of Culture</h3>

<p>
Wittgenstein sees a new word in a discussion, a conversation, and
exchange, or a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; with oneself, as a fresh
seed sown on the ground of that discussion. That is, it quickly
becomes a new &ldquo;plant&rdquo; with root, stalk, and branches
growing out through ever-expanding webs of association (Hagberg,
2015). He saw creativity in music and the arts in parallel terms, and
this image of the new seed provides the clue to the way he saw both
the &ldquo;soil&rdquo; in which new work in the arts grows, and the
way a work&rsquo;s &ldquo;roots&rdquo; reach into, and draw
nourishment from, a culture. Thus, for Wittgenstein the way to
understand the significance of a work of art is to historically
imagine our way into the culture in which it grew and in which it has
its original meaning-determining relations and
 comparisons.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 And he speaks of the way in which a work of art can then live beyond
its original context and reach out into new webs of relations,
comparisons, and associations&mdash;but where some of the
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of that original culture will nevertheless come
with it (Wittgenstein 1980a, passim). This makes the work like a word
that is a new seed and yet that carries, however submerged or
invisible to a superficial glance, its etymological origin and
evolution with it. And Wittgenstein sees that the multiple
perspectives, multiple standpoints, from which we can
&ldquo;view&rdquo; a word is itself an aesthetic phenomenon&mdash;that
is, that we can see both word and work in varying frames of reference,
varying contexts, and ultimately differing cultures (see Szabados
2014). It is for this reason that Wittgenstein takes similes in the
philosophy of language so seriously; to articulate a likeness is to
specify and demarcate meaning. And articulating a simile, be it
linguistic or aesthetic, is a way of specifying how it is that we see
both words and works in the contexts of their discourses. One might
inquire, in the spirit of ordinary-language philosophy, into the
occasion or particular instance of the employment of a word or phrase
in order to specify or more deeply comprehend its meaning-content;
works of art, for Wittgenstein, have occasions of their
&ldquo;utterance&rdquo; as well. He sees that parallels of linguistic
life are woven through our aesthetic practices; sense-making in one is
very like sense-making in the other (Hagberg 2019a). To understand
words at greater depth is to see them within the culture in which
those words have their life; works of art are the same.</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s extensive work of aspect-perception or seeing-as
(PI: Pt. II, sec. xi) must also take an important place in considering
his broader philosophy of culture: to see one thing in light of
another is not the same as seeing that one thing (Hagberg 2010 and
2016a). For example, to hear a melody as a variation of another is
very different from hearing simply that melody. One could insist that
the sonic experience is identical&mdash;and in a reductive way it is.
But the point is that these two hearings are dramatically different
phenomenologically if not sonically: the variation is situated into
what one might call an imagination-supported
&ldquo;double-hearing&rdquo;. We hear what it is, and we
&ldquo;hear&rdquo; its origin-melody behind it. Blown up to the
grander scale of a culture-wide mode of perception, this is how
Wittgenstein sees aesthetic understanding: it is imagination-assisted
perception informed by cultural awareness. This case of hearing the
melody as a variation is like an auditory simile; the visual arts and
literature work in the same
 way.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 And so: to strip any work of art down to its internally-contained,
non-relational, non-contextual qualities would be the aesthetic
parallel of the atomistic, invariant, and transcontextual conception
of word-meaning discussed above. Of course, to view or experience any
work of art in a manner wholly focused on its internal properties and
the internal relations between its parts is possible&mdash;but that
exclusionary focus, once completed, will itself then reach out beyond
its internal boundaries into the culture within which that
internal-property analysis is contained (for example, the formalistic
musical aesthetics of Eduard Hanslick, arguing for internal analysis,
itself becomes more comprehensible when seen in the light of the
broader intellectual impulses of Viennese culture at that time). For
Wittgenstein, like words in the context of a culture&rsquo;s
linguistic practices, the richer qualities of a work will emerge when
we see that work in the light of the culture that served as its
soil.</p>

<h2 id="N5Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Everything covered here concerning the impoverishing and blinding
superimposition of conceptual models, templates, and pictures onto the
extraordinarily rich world of aesthetic engagement gives further
content to what Wittgenstein meant at the beginning of his lectures on
aesthetics with the words &ldquo;entirely misunderstood&rdquo;.
Throughout Wittgenstein&rsquo;s development, culminating in the
complexity-exploring project of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>
and other work on certainty and on the philosophy of psychology,
Wittgenstein is unearthing the philosophical presuppositions of
simplification-seeking philosophical undertakings. And throughout this
work it is, as we have seen, examples themselves that have priority as
indispensable instruments in the struggle to free ourselves of
misconception in the aesthetic realm in particular and more broadly in
philosophy taken as a whole. Such examples, given due and detailed
attention, will exhibit a context-sensitive particularity that makes
generalized pronouncements hovering high above the ground of that
detail look otiose, inattentive, or, more bluntly, merely a
theoretically-motivated falsification of cultural experience. What
remains after such investigation is not, then&mdash;and this is an
idea Wittgenstein&rsquo;s auditors must themselves have struggled with
in those rooms in Cambridge, as many still do today&mdash;another
theory built upon now stronger foundations, but rather a clear view of
our multiform aesthetic practices. Wittgenstein, in his distinctive
work and his original approach to philosophy and its problems, did not
generate a theory of language, of mind, or of mathematics. He
generated, rather, a vast body of work perhaps united only in its
therapeutic and intricately labored search for conceptual
clarification. One sees the same philosophical aspiration driving his
forays, distributed across the full range of his writings, into
aesthetics.</p>
