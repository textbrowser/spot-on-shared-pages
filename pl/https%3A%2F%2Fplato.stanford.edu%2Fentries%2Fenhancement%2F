<h1>Human Enhancement</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Apr 7, 2015; substantive revision Thu Nov 13, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
At first glance there does not seem to be anything philosophically
problematic about human enhancement. Activities such as physical
fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and
meditation are routinely utilized for the goal of enhancing human
capacities. But there are a cluster of debates in practical ethics,
conventionally labeled as &ldquo;the ethics of human
enhancement&rdquo;, that do raise philosophical questions. These
debates include clinicians&rsquo; concerns about the limits of
legitimate health care, parents&rsquo; worries about their
reproductive and rearing obligations, and the fairness of competitive
practices like sports and war, and the possibility of improving human
moral agency itself. They also involve more general questions about
distributive justice, science policy, and the public regulation of
medical technologies.</p>

<p>
As usual in practical ethics, an adequate discussion of any specific
debate under this heading quickly requires orientation to the science
and the social and political practices of specific enhancement
interventions. At each turn in these discussions, wide vistas of
background philosophical topics also appear for exploration. Rather
than providing a detailed account of this whole landscape, we trace a
path of core concerns that winds through the current debates on the
ethics of human enhancement, as a guide for those interested in
exploring further.</p>

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="TerHumEnh">1.1 Terminology: &lsquo;Human&rsquo; and &lsquo;Enhancement&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
As our preface suggests, the ordinary use of &lsquo;human
enhancement&rsquo; refers to a wide range of practices, many of which
are not explored in the enhancement ethics literature. To orient our
tour, it is important to note that usage of the terms
&lsquo;human&rsquo; and &lsquo;enhancement&rsquo; in the literature
merit some initial clarification.</p>

<p>
In order to avoid equivocating terms in these debates, it is useful to
distinguish different uses of the term &lsquo;human&rsquo;. On the one
hand, there are biological uses of &lsquo;human&rsquo; to refer to
members of the species <em>homo sapiens</em>. On the other hand, there
are moral uses of &lsquo;human&rsquo; to refer to <em>persons</em> or
<em>members of the moral community</em>. The biological and moral uses
of &lsquo;human&rsquo; are familiar in the abortion debate, where
there is disagreement about the personhood or moral standing of
prenatal human life, and one must be careful in that context to
distinguish biological and ethical/moral uses of the term
&lsquo;human&rsquo; when defending one&rsquo;s stance. As it will
become clear in the following sections, in the enhancement debate
equivocations between biological and ethical senses of the term
&lsquo;human&rsquo; are sources of many apparent disagreements. Is
there anything special about being a member of the biological species
<em>homo sapiens</em> that enhancements could threaten? Or do
enhancements somehow threaten being human in an ethical sense, e.g.,
being a subject who has moral rights and duties and is deserving of
respect? Are those who criticize enhancements as dehumanizing really
thinking about the loss of other markers of the moral standing that is
commonly attributed to persons? At this preliminary stage in the
discussion, we are foreclosing neither the biological nor the
evaluative senses of &lsquo;human&rsquo; from the start but will stay
alert to both until it becomes important to distinguish and relate
them.</p>

<p>
With the term &lsquo;enhancement&rsquo;, on the other hand, it is
helpful to specify a working definition from the start. One might
simply use &lsquo;enhancement&rsquo; as a synonym for
&lsquo;improvement&rsquo;: to enhance is to improve. This definition
has the virtue of being aligned with ordinary usage. However, in the
context of debates about human enhancement, not all improvements to
human capacities are on par (Agar 2024). If I take corticosteroids for
my allergies, that is a <em>therapeutic improvement</em>, which
restores my breathing to normal levels of functioning and health.
(Agar 2024) There is not much room for reasonable debate about whether
it would be wrong to take safe and low-cost medications for
therapeutic improvements (Kamm 2005). However, in the enhancement
literature, &lsquo;enhancements&rsquo; standardly refer to
<em>biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form or
functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain
health</em>. This broad definition flows from and reflects the
foundational literature in this area (Parens 1995, Juengst 1998). and
it also has several implications that are sometimes forgotten.</p>

<p>
First, it means that simple line-drawing exercises aimed at isolating
enhancement technologies from other biomedical interventions for
special precautionary regulation or oversight are destined to be
ineffective (<em>pace</em> Anderson 1989). This is because there are
no enhancement technologies <em>per se</em>. Whether a given
biomedical intervention counts as an enhancement depends on how it is
used. When ankle-strengthening surgery is used to improve a
bicyclist&rsquo;s competitive edge, it might raise enhancement
concerns, but as a treatment for a bicyclist&rsquo;s ankle injury, it
does not. This means that the developers of even the most outr&eacute;
enhancement interventions will almost always be able to appeal to some
correlative therapeutic uses to justify their research, testing, and
release into the market (Mehlman 1999; Juengst, et al. 2024). On the
other hand, simply pointing out that biomedical technologies can have
both therapeutic and enhancement uses does nothing to collapse the
logical distinction between those uses, or to defeat the claim that
those distinguishable uses might warrant different ethical responses
(Buchanan 2011). Although the logical distinction between treatment
and enhancement is clear, as we show in Section 2, understanding
exactly how to use the distinction and its moral significance are
matters of debate.</p>

<p>
Second, the term &lsquo;enhancement&rsquo; as it is standardly used in
these debates restricts its scope to biomedical interventions, even
though other methods of increasing normal human capacities raise
ethical issues as well. Electronic and robotic tools that enable us to
listen, observe, help or harm at a distance, training designed to
maximize particular talents, and social practices that foster new
forms of human relationship all come with their own trade-offs and
moral concerns. But the focus of the enhancement ethics literature is
overwhelmingly on interventions that make biological changes in human
bodies and brains, using pharmaceutical, surgical, nanotechnological,
robotics or genetic techniques (Clarke, et al. 2016, Agar 2013).
Standard examples include:</p>

<ul>

<li>cosmetic surgery (Miller, Brody and Chung, 2000; Little,
1998),</li>

<li>the use of performance enhancing drugs to improve athletic
endurance and strength (Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer 2013; Devine
2023),</li>

<li>psychopharmaceutical approaches to increasing memory, elevating
mood, and improving cognitive capacities (Elliott 1998; Whitehouse, et
al. 1997; Savulescu, et al. 2011; Glannon 2011; Levy, Douglas,
Kahane, et al. 2014a; Duncan 2016; Earp 2018, May 2023), and</li>

<li>genetic and neurological interventions to increase the human life
span, acquire new sensory-motor abilities, and, through &ldquo;moral
enhancement&rdquo;, live together in more peaceable, generous, and
just ways (cf. Savulescu, ter Meulen and Kahane 2011; Harris 2016;
Wiseman 2016; Johnson, Bishop and Toner 2019; May 2023).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, our definition implies that enhancement interventions attempt
to improve specific human capacities and traits, rather than whole
persons. Unlike such comprehensive personal-improvement strategies
such as psychoanalysis or &ldquo;the power of positive
thinking&rdquo;, biomedical enhancements offer a piecemeal approach to
human perfectibility. As a result, biomedical enhancements involve
trade-offs. Comparative thinking about the value of enhancements along
different dimensions of desirability is unavoidable and is usually
more of an exercise in optimization than idealization (Brennan and
Moseley 2013). If extended life span comes with prolonged frailty, or
if enhanced altruism compromises survival skills, the overall value of
the enhancement can be called into question.</p>

<h3 id="BriHisBac">1.2 Brief Historical Background</h3>

<p>
An important part of the orientation for those new to thinking about
enhancement ethics is the ways in which current debates are shaped by
the history of earlier efforts at perfecting people. At one level,
perfectionist and meliorist impulses have deep roots in Western
philosophical and religious thinking, which both modern science and
medicine have inherited (Roduit 2016; Rothman and Rothman 2004) Most
advocates and critics of biomedical enhancement share these
commitments to the value of human excellence and the use of human
effort to improve well-being and reducing suffering in the world, but
have disagreeing visions of the ideal (Roduit, Baumann, and Heilinger
2013; Parens 2005). Other scholars, recalling the historical
imposition of hegemonic religious and political visions of salvation
and citizenship, fear the elevation of any canonical account of
existing human virtues, in favor of visions that prize people&rsquo;s
capacity to shape their own ideals through reason, autonomy, and
democratic deliberation (Sparrow 2014; Buchanan 2011). Others,
pointing to the consequences of modern individualism for the common
good (Persson and Savelescu 2012), feel confident about being able to
name the constellation of existing human traits that should either be
preserved (Kass 1997; Annas 1998; Agar 2013) or enhanced (Bostrom
2003). However, almost no one in this literature eschews the
development and use of new medical tools for healing purposes (Kamm
2005; Kass 2003). Because of this, a first step in our discussion is
to scrutinize the distinction between treatment and enhancement, to
see if it can help demarcate where different melioristic ideals
diverge.</p>

<p>
Another, perhaps more visible, backdrop for the enhancement ethics
literature is the history of the 20th century eugenics movement, which
attempted to &ldquo;breed better people&rdquo; and &ldquo;improve the
human gene pool&rdquo; through socially biased reproductive controls
and inducements (Wikler 1999; Buchanan, et al. 2000; Lombardo 2022).
This background prompts questions about the cultural authority of
science and the social values it can perpetuate, and it raises fears
of slippery slopes that can lead to egregious forms of oppression, by
providing a vivid recent counter-narrative to endorsements of
enhancement as a way to fulfill our obligations to future generations
(Sparrow 2011; Selgelid 2013; Iltis 2016). The eugenics backdrop tends
to skew the burden of proof the other way in the debate, towards a
more &ldquo;precautionary&rdquo; stance that gives advocates of
enhancement the burden of distinguishing their proposals from old
style eugenics in order to defend the parts of that ideology that they
share (Kitcher 1997; Harris, 2007; Agar 2004).</p>

<p>
Finally, in the historical foreground for enhancement ethics are
contemporary critiques of the commercialization (and homogenization)
of beauty through &ldquo;aesthetic medicine&rdquo; (Bordo 1993), the
evolving history of pharmaceutical performance enhancement in sports
(Hoberman 1992), and the scientific career of human gene transfer and
&lsquo;genetic engineering&rsquo; (Friedman 1998). Each of these
stories supports a literature of its own, which has contributed
important insights to the broader discussion of enhancement ethics.
From feminist and disability studies come critiques of the
medicalization of human beauty, focusing on complicity with unjust
social norms that can turn ordinary welfare meliorism on its head to
prioritize the enhancement uses of biomedicine over standard
therapeutic applications (Silvers 1998). Meanwhile, discussions of
&ldquo;doping&rdquo; in sport have illuminated the ways in which
enhancement interventions can undermine communal social practices that
depend on presumptions of equality, lifting the discussion above the
level of individual choices and transactions (Murray 1987; Murray
2009). Similarly, the checkered career of human gene therapy and the
emergence of human gene editing has kept on the table the need to
anticipate the physical risks of putative improvements, and how
daunting they would make the foreseeable prospect of any
intergenerational &ldquo;germ line&rdquo; enhancement intervention
(Walters and Palmer 1997; Kimmelman 2009; NASEM 2017).</p>

<p>
All of these contextual &ldquo;back-stories&rdquo; to the contemporary
enhancement debates are worth exploring further. They have shaped
contemporary thinking about and reactions to enhancement proposals and
provide important cautionary tales to keep in mind when evaluating
those proposals. At the same time, these back-stories bring their own
assumptions and biases into the discussion and can thereby complicate
a fresh philosophical assessment.</p>

<h2 id="WhaProLimHeaCar">2. What are the Proper Limits of Health Care?</h2>

<p>
While much of the enhancement ethics literature leans towards thought
experiments set in the future, it is grounded in a set of important
debates about how health care should be defined today. In these
debates, the claim is often made that the distinction between using
biomedical tools to combat human disease and attempting to use them to
enhance healthy human traits can provide practical guidance on a range
of issues, including the limits of health professionals&rsquo;
obligations (Miller, Brody and Chung 2000), the scope of health care
payment plans (Daniels and Sabin 1994), and the prioritization of
biomedical research protocols (Mehlman, Berg, Juengst and Kodish
2011). In each of these cases, the line between treatment and
enhancement is drawn to mark an upper boundary of professional and
social obligations. Just as the concept of futile treatment is used to
indicate the limits of a doctor&rsquo;s obligations when further
intervention no longer can achieve therapeutic goals, enhancement
interventions are thought to fall outside health care&rsquo;s proper
domain of practice by going &ldquo;beyond therapy&rdquo; in pursuit of
other non-medical goals (Kass 2003). This means that patients have no
role-related right to demand such services from health professionals,
fair insurance coverage plans may exclude them, and those who do
provide them bear a burden of justification for doing so that does not
apply to &ldquo;medically necessary&rdquo; interventions.</p>

<p>
As a biomedical boundary marker, the distinction between treatment and
enhancement has been enshrined in policies at both professional and
governmental levels and continues to inform much of the public
discussion of new biomedical advances. However, this distinction is
explicated in several different ways, which have different merits as
boundary markers for biomedical research and practice. In fact, with
philosophical scrutiny, the distinction often seems in danger of
collapsing entirely under conceptual critiques even before the
question of its moral merits is entertained.</p>

<p>
When it is used as a medical boundary concept, enhancement, like
futility, plays both descriptive and ethical roles. To use these
concepts, we need to be able to identify our efforts as either futile
or enhancing and we need to know what the boundary means for going
further. Part of the practical challenge for policymakers is that for
enhancement interventions, these descriptive and moral implications
seem to be at cross-purposes. While futile treatments do no good,
enhancements are by definition and description <em>improvements</em>
in personal welfare. Yet, the boundary function of calling them
&ldquo;enhancements&rdquo; in health policy settings is to place them
outside of sanctioned interventions. For a field dedicated to pursuing
improved welfare for its patients, the fact that enhancements often
look just like all the other improvements that health care strives to
achieve makes it difficult to discern when an intervention
transgresses the normative boundary that the concept purports to
mark.</p>

<p>
This has provoked three major ways of operationalizing the enhancement
concept, each of which seeks to redress the weaknesses of its
predecessor.</p>

<h3 id="ProDomAcc">2.1 Professional Domain Accounts</h3>

<p>
The first approach to defining the line between treatment and
enhancement appeals to the health professions&rsquo; conventional
vision of their proper domain. Accordingly, &ldquo;treatments&rdquo;
are any interventions that the professional standards of care endorse,
while &ldquo;enhancements&rdquo; are any interventions that the
professions declare to be beyond their purview. Attempts by
professional societies to police their own frontiers by discouraging
particular practices as &ldquo;enhancement&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;treatment&rdquo; reflect this approach, as do appeals to
&ldquo;community standards&rdquo; by health care payers seeking to
distinguish &ldquo;elective&rdquo; from &ldquo;medically
necessary&rdquo; interventions for payment.</p>

<p>
For those committed to a particular account of the goals of health
care, this approach can offer normative guidance for internal
criticism of suspect professional practices (Kass 1985). But of
course, there are numerous competing philosophies of health care, none
of which command universal allegiance within the health professions.
In fact, this approach also resonates well with those who argue that
the health professions have no intrinsic domain of practice, beyond
that which they can negotiate with patients (Good 1994). For those
influenced by this libertarian view of professional autonomy, the
normative lesson for professionals concerned about their obligations
in specific cases can be simple: whatever interventions their patients
will accept can be considered &ldquo;treatments&rdquo;, while
&ldquo;enhancements&rdquo; are simply those interventions which
individual health professionals refuse to provide (Engelhardt 1990).
Unfortunately, medical historians and sociologists point out that the
health professions have always been adept at adapting to the cultural
beliefs and social values of the institutions and communities they
serve. This is done by &lsquo;medicalizing&rsquo; new problems so that
they come to be seen as a legitimate part of medicine&rsquo;s
jurisdiction (Conrad 2007). Given the health professions&rsquo;
philosophical pluralism and political autonomy, their own conventions
seem to provide no principled way to exclude new interventions from
their domain. To the extent that useful &ldquo;upper boundary&rdquo;
concepts are required at the policy level (e.g., for societies making
health care allocation decisions) this impotence is an important
failing for this approach to drawing the distinction.</p>

<h3 id="NorFunAcc">2.2 Normal Function Accounts</h3>

<p>
There is another approach to interpreting the treatment/enhancement
distinction that seeks to provide a firmer theoretical foundation for
delimiting legitimate health care needs. On this approach, to be
healthy is to be able to do all that appropriately matched members of
one&rsquo;s own species can do, in our case what human beings of
similar age and gender can do. Legitimate health care needs or
&ldquo;health problems&rdquo; or &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; or
&ldquo;maladies&rdquo; are all characterized by a fall from that level
of functional capacity. All proper health care services, therefore,
should be aimed at getting people back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, e.g.,
restoring an individual&rsquo;s functional capability to the
species-typical range for their reference class, and within that range
to the particular capability level which was the patient&rsquo;s
genetic birthright. Interventions which take people to the top of
their personal potential (like athletic training) or beyond their own
birth range (like growth hormone), or to the top of the range of their
reference class, or to the top of the species-typical range, or beyond
(!), are all to be counted as enhancements and fall successively
further beyond the responsibility of medicine or health care.</p>

<p>
The advantage of the normal function account is that it provides a
single (relatively) unified goal for health care, towards which the
burdens and benefits of various interventions can be compared,
measured, balanced, and integrated. Normal functionalists can use
physiology to determine when they&rsquo;ve achieved the species
typical range and clinical histories to determine when they&rsquo;ve
brought a patient up to the baseline of his or her personal capability
range.</p>

<p>
Some critics of the normal function approach take issue with its focus
on the &ldquo;species-typical range&rdquo;, arguing that it is
insensitive to the diversity of ways in which human beings can
flourish in life. They point out that those born with disabilities may
be wary of biomedicine&rsquo;s &ldquo;fatal attraction to
normalizing&rdquo; (Silvers 1998; Asch and Block 2011). Moreover, even
when no amount of treatment can give someone &ldquo;species
typical&rdquo; functioning, there may be compensatory technologies
that can actually expand their range of opportunities beyond the norm
(Silvers 1998). Should powered wheelchairs be designed to slow and
stop at the same distance that walking humans would succumb to
fatigue, in order to keep them from &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; their
users&rsquo; abilities? By the same token, the naturally gifted may
find that they have no claim to treatment for injuries or accidents
that merely bring them down into the &ldquo;normal range&rdquo;. If
our champion thinkers, athletes and saints can legitimately claim
treatment for problems that impair their species-optimal functioning,
bringing the rest of us up to their levels should count as proper
health care as well. But that leaves only the most extreme
improvements on the other side of the &ldquo;enhancement&rdquo;
boundary: if our species champions are the benchmark, only
interventions that create capacities no human has had before would
fall beyond medicine&rsquo;s proper domain. Individualizing the
optimal functional range to individual genomic potentials will not
resolve this problem, of course, to the extent that our genomes
themselves become biomedically malleable. Establishing the
&ldquo;species-typical norm&rdquo; for a particular human function is
a difficult enough task, even where descriptive statistics can help.
But when the boundary is &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; not
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; functioning, the evidentiary foundations of the
approach begin to come apart (Sculley and Rehman-Sutter 2008).</p>

<p>
The second serious problem for the normal function approach is the
challenge of prevention. While some efforts at health promotion, such
as exercise, straddle the border of medical responsibility, many
preventive interventions (i.e., vaccines) are widely accepted as
legitimate parts of medicine&rsquo;s mission and are located squarely
on the treatment side of the enhancement boundary. One of the ways to
prevent disease is to strengthen the body&rsquo;s ability to resist
pathological changes before any diagnosable problem appears. But to
the extent that prevention attempts to elevate bodily functions above
the normal range for the individual (and, in some cases, even the
species typical range), it seems to slide into what the normal
function approach would call enhancement. If the normal function
account is taken seriously as a biomedical boundary marker, how does
one defend this kind of prevention? Conversely, if preventive
interventions like these are acceptable in medicine, what can it mean
to claim that researchers and clinicians should be &ldquo;drawing the
line&rdquo; at enhancement? (Juengst, et al. 2024)</p>

<h3 id="DisBasAcc">2.3 Disease-Based Accounts</h3>

<p>
Probably the most common rejoinder to the problem of prevention is to
distinguish the problems to which they respond. Treatments are
interventions that address the health problems created by diagnosable
diseases and disabilities: <em>maladies</em> in the helpful language
of Gert, Culver and Clouser (2006). Enhancements, on the other hand,
are interventions aimed at healthy systems and traits. Thus,
prescribing biosynthetic growth hormone to rectify a diagnosable
growth hormone deficiency is legitimate treatment, while prescribing
it for patients with normal growth hormone levels would be an attempt
at positive genetic engineering or enhancement (Berger and Gert 1991).
On this account, to justify an intervention as appropriate medicine
means to be able to identify a malady in the patient. If no medically
recognizable malady can be diagnosed, the intervention cannot be
medically necessary and is thus suspect as an enhancement. This would
clear the way for safe and effective genetic &ldquo;vaccines&rdquo;
against predictable muscle damage (even if they provided better than
normal damage resistance) but would screen out as enhancements efforts
to improve traits that were at no diagnosable risk of deterioration
(Juengst 1997).</p>

<p>
These accounts have the advantage of being simple, intuitively
appealing, and consistent with a lot of biomedical behavior. Maladies
are objectively observable phenomena and the traditional target of
medical intervention. We can know maladies through diagnosis, and we
can tell that we have gone beyond medicine when no pathology can be
identified. Thus, pediatric endocrinologists discourage enhancement
uses of biosynthetic growth hormone by citing the old adage &ldquo;If
it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;. This interpretation
is also at work in the efforts of professionals working at the
boundary, like cosmetic surgeons, to justify their services. They
claim to be relieving diagnosable psychological suffering (mental
maladies) rather than satisfying the aesthetic tastes of their
clients, and insurance companies insist on being provided with that
diagnosis before providing coverage for such surgeries.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, disease-based accounts also face at least two
objections. The first is one they share with the Professional Domain
account: the problem of biomedicine&rsquo;s infamous nosological
elasticity. It is not hard to coin new maladies for the purposes of
justifying the use of enhancement interventions (Carey, Melvin and
Ranney 2008). Unless some specific (and usually contentious) theory of
disease is employed to give this approach its teeth, it puts the power
for drawing the boundary back into the profession&rsquo;s hands and
raises the same worries about the social domain accounts (Parens
2013). The more important practical problem is that no matter how the
line is drawn, most biotechnological interventions that could be seen
as problematic if used as enhancements will not need to be justified
as enhancements in order to be developed and approved for clinical
use. This is because most such interventions will also have legitimate
therapeutic applications. Indeed, most biomedical tools with potential
for enhancement uses will first emerge as therapeutic agents. For
example, general cognitive enhancement interventions are likely to be
approved for use only in patients with neurological diseases. However,
to the extent that they are in high demand by individuals suffering
the effects of normal aging, the risk of unapproved or
&ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses will be high (Whitehouse, et al.
1997).</p>

<p>
This last point is critical for policy purposes, because it suggests
that, in countries like the USA, the real challenge may not be
regulation of the development of enhancement interventions, but rather
the regulation of downstream &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses of
therapeutic interventions for non-medical, enhancement purposes.
(However, c.f., Moseley and Fr&ouml;hlich (2025) discuss cases of
non-invasive brain stimulation technology that was first developed and
tested on healthy subjects to evaluate boosts in creativity and was
later utilized for therapeutic purposes.) The policy problems then
become problems about controlling access and use of certain
interventions, rather than their development. Of course, the fact that
a certain type of intervention is declared illegal for physicians to
dispense, does not immediately imply that it is morally wrong for
anyone to pursue or for other competent professionals to provide.
These realities have pressed those who would use the
treatment/enhancement distinction for policy purposes to articulate
the moral dangers of biomedical enhancement more clearly. Even if
doctors eschew such use on professional ethical grounds, are there
independent moral reasons why individual athletes, parents, students
or other &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; of enhancement interventions, should
turn away from their availability?</p>

<h2 id="ItUnfUseEnh">3. Is it Unfair to Use Enhancements?</h2>

<p>
One type of human enhancement that has received extensive
philosophical attention is the use of biomedical interventions to
improve the physical performance of athletes in the context of sports
(Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer, et al. 2013; Devine 2023). One
reason athletic performance enhancement garners so much attention is
because of its currency, given the epidemic of doping scandals in
contemporary sport. Another reason, however, is that it serves as a
paradigm case for teasing out important dimensions of the problem: it
involves measurable improvements in biological capacities in a social
context that is both well outside health care and defined by clear
rules of engagement.</p>

<p>
At first impression, the ethical problem with performance enhancement
in sport would seem to be simply a problem of cheating (Schermer,
2008a). If the rules of sport forbid the use of performance
enhancements, then their illicit use confers an advantage to users
against other athletes (who either accept the rules of the game or do
not have access to the enhancement interventions). That advantage, in
turn, can create pressure for more athletes to cheat in the same way,
undermining the basis for the competitions at stake and exacerbating
the gap between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot
(Murray 1987, Sparrow 2015, Devine 2023).</p>

<p>
Extrapolating from sports to a broader competitive view of society at
large, critics argue that the widespread social acceptance of
enhancement interventions would exacerbate inequalities and create
unfair advantages for privileged individuals. That situation is likely
to result in the development of sharp divides between enhanced and
unenhanced populations, or between an elite class of
&ldquo;genobility&rdquo; and an underprivileged class of
&ldquo;genpoor&rdquo;, raising distributive justice and human rights
concerns (Mehlman 2003, 2009; Buchanan, et al. 2000; Sparrow
2011).</p>

<p>
Much of the rhetoric about &ldquo;doping&rdquo; assumes the very claim
that needs to be established by argument: that the rules of sport (or
the norms of social advancement) ought to ban the use of biomedical
enhancement. The rules of a sport can be changed. Novel performance
enhancing technologies and training methods are regularly integrated
in sports. Thus, whether it is morally permissible to introduce
specific biomedical enhancements in sports, in general and in
particular sports, depends on considerations about fairness,
distributive justice, and the goals of sport itself (or the goals of
particular sports). Fairness issues around equitable access to
enhancements can sometimes be addressed directly, such as the
International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s decision to provide all teams
with &ldquo;FastSkin&rdquo; swimming suits at the Sydney Olympics. In
other cases, inequalities may come to be accepted as unfortunate but
not unjust. For example, when an equatorial country&rsquo;s ski team
did not have access to artificial snow and so could not compete evenly
with the ski teams of northern countries.</p>

<p>
If enhancement interventions can either be distributed fairly or the
inequities they create can be written into the rules of the particular
sport in question as part of the given advantages of the more
fortunate, then participants no longer face a fairness problem. For
those who can afford it, for example, what would be ethically suspect
about mounting a mirror image of the &ldquo;Special Olympics&rdquo;
for athletes with disabilities: a &ldquo;Super Olympics&rdquo;,
featuring athletes universally equipped with the latest modifications
and enhancements? (Munthe 2000)</p>

<p>
For answers to that challenge, the critics of biomedical enhancement
need to dig beyond concerns about the fair governance of sports to a
deeper and broader sense of &ldquo;cheating&rdquo;, in terms of the
corrosive effects of enhancement on the integrity of admirable human
practices (Loland 2002; Schermer 2008a). On this view, to the extent
that biomedical shortcuts allow specific accomplishments to be
divorced from the admirable practices they were designed to reflect,
the social value of those accomplishments will be undermined. If
one&rsquo;s good grades are gained by drug fueled
&ldquo;cramming&rdquo; rather than disciplined study, their value as
evidence of learning diminish. This means that for institutions
interested in continuing to foster the social values for which they
have traditionally been the guardians, choices will have to be made.
Either they must redesign their sports to find new ways to evaluate
excellence in the admirable practices that are not affected by
available enhancements, or they must prohibit the use of the enhancing
shortcuts. However, knowing which way to go suggests that one has a
theory of the social practice at risk and of the values that animate
it. The case of sport again leads the way down this path in the
literature, perhaps because, unlike most important social practices
that might be susceptible to enhancement shortcuts (like
child-rearing, education, love, politics, and spiritual growth), the
stakes are low enough to allow for some deliberate policymaking at the
international level.</p>

<p>
For example, one prominent theory that has influenced the work of The
World Anti-Doping Association (WADA), the international organization
committed to policing performance enhancement in elite sport, is the
view that &ldquo;just as healing is the point or goal or end of
surgery, so the virtuous perfection of natural talents is the point or
goal or end of sport&rdquo; (Murray 2009). This statement has several
important features for the enhancement debate. Sport is concerned with
celebrating differences in natural talents and the virtues that can be
displayed in attempts to differentiate one&rsquo;s own talents even
further. The virtues that sport celebrates are socially admirable
habits and traits in and of themselves, and their promotion is what
gives sport social value as a practice. However, within the practice,
the virtues are instrumental (as either side-constraints or
facilitators) to the perfection of the athlete&rsquo;s natural
talents&mdash;i.e., to their differentiation from other people&rsquo;s
talents. Although the key role of hierarchical ranking in sport is
often ignored in the rhetoric of sports organizations, philosophers of
sport acknowledge that fixation with hierarchical ranking&mdash;with
competition, contest, score-keeping, record-breaking, championship,
victory and defeat&mdash;is pervasive in the everyday practice of
sport (Coakley 1998) and that &ldquo;comparing and ranking two or more
competitors&hellip;defines sports characteristic social
structure&rdquo; (Loland 2002, 10). Sport exemplifies a system of
values, virtues, and practices explicitly designed to rank people
hierarchically based on their naturally inherited and virtuously
perfected traits, celebrating the best specimens as champions. What is
unfair about biomedical enhancement, on this view, is that
enhancements undermine the traditional role of sport, and its ideals
of virtue and personal effort: enhancements obscure the distinction
between to distinguish individuals who naturally inherited their
talents from their progenitors from those who artificially acquired
them from their physicians (Sandel 2004).</p>

<p>
But this outcome seems to display the very problem that the fairness
critique of enhancement was meant to combat: the danger of fomenting
distributive injustice by creating social hierarchies of advantage on
arbitrary grounds (T&auml;nnsj&ouml; 2000; T&auml;nnsj&ouml; 2005). On
the one hand, of the many ways humans use inherited traits to create
interpersonal hierarchies, athletic competition is amongst the most
benign. When it is &ldquo;just a game&rdquo;, comparative
interpersonal ranking in terms of genetic identity in sports is a
welcome substitute for blood feuds, racism, and genocide. But when
sport becomes a matter of national pride and a source of economic
opportunity, athletic losers risk more than simply admiration and
social status: like insurance applicants with genetic
susceptibilities, less naturally talented athletes risk access to
important social benefits and potential life plans. In this regard,
the challenge that performance enhancement poses to sport is its
indictment of the accepted social practice itself rather than its
threat to undermine it. The availability of biomedical abilities to
undermine competition simply raises the question: are there ways to
enjoy, appreciate and even show off our bodies and abilities without
requiring someone else to lose social standing on genetic grounds?</p>

<p>
Enhancements might reveal inherent injustices within traditional
hierarchies in sports, rather than merely create unfair advantages
that reward inherited genetic traits and penalize athletes who,
through no fault of their own, lack them. In this way, enhancements
could promote fairness in sports rather than diminish it. We will
examine below whether fairness arguments have a similar impact in
discussions of enhancement within the domain of other social
practices, such as parenting, education, or military service.</p>

<h2 id="ShoWePurMorEnh">4. Should We Pursue Moral Enhancements?</h2>

<h3 id="WhaMorEnh">4.1 What are Moral Enhancements?</h3>

<p>
When discussing the notion of <em>moral enhancement</em>, two salient
questions arise: (1) What does &lsquo;moral&rsquo; refer to in this
context? and (2) How do we distinguish moral enhancement from other
types of enhancement? (Moseley 2025) Regarding the first question, it
is crucial to distinguish moral enhancements from technologically
induced improvements in mood, emotion, cognition, creativity, or
imagination, even though such capacities are usually involved in moral
improvement.</p>

<p>
Mark Rowlands argues that most discussions of moral enhancement fail
to address these preliminary questions and contends that a substantive
conception of morality is necessary to develop an intelligible and
consistent account of moral improvement (Rowlands 2018). To determine
whether our moral capacities are improved by enhancing certain human
abilities, we must first clarify what constitutes a moral improvement.
For example, a Kantian might understand moral enhancement as
strengthening our capacity to evaluate motives and act from the maxim
of the categorical imperative. An Aristotelian virtue theorist would
emphasize improving capacities that foster practical wisdom. A Humean
sentimentalist might contend that moral improvements involve
strengthening capacities for empathy or sympathy. (Rowlands 2018)
These examples simplify the complexity of each metaphysical theory,
but they show the difficulty of assuming a single, straightforward
sense of &ldquo;moral improvement&rdquo; (Moseley 2025).</p>

<p>
These rival philosophical stances also complicate the notion of a
common moral baseline, i.e., a standard of normal human moral
functioning from which any improvement above that threshold would
count as an enhancement. The Kantian, Aristotelian, and Humean
accounts diverge on this point. Rowlands offers a sketch of how each
framework might be used to specify what counts as a moral enhancement.
(2018)</p>

<p>
An alternative strategy for avoiding definitional complexity is to
examine particular cases that clearly involve the relevant moral
issues. Douglas (2008), for instance, examines biomedical
interventions that target specific moral failings, such as strong
aversions to certain racial groups or impulsive aggression. These
cases sharply raise the ethical question: is it morally permissible,
or even obligatory, to use biomedical interventions (e.g.,
psychopharmacology, psychedelic drugs, non-invasive neuromodulation,
electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation) to make someone
less racist or less prone to violent acts?</p>

<h3 id="WeUnfForFut">4.2 Are We Unfit for the Future?</h3>

<p>
Interest in moral enhancement has surged over the past decade. Much of
this attention to the topic is in direct response to the influential
work of Igmar Persson and Julian Savulescu (2012), who argue that the
survival of our species depends on the urgent development and
widespread adoption of moral enhancement technologies. They argue that
global collective-action problems cannot be solved by traditional
means or by cognitive enhancement alone. Worried that an unregulated
expansion of cognitive enhancements might amplify injustice and social
harm, they argue that widespread access to cognitive enhancement
should be preceded, or accompanied, by enhancement of our moral
faculties. Improved moral discernment and reasoning, keener senses of
empathy and fairness, and deeper sense of solidarity, they contend,
would help mitigate the potential social harms by ensuring that the
users of enhancement technologies are equipped to do so responsibly
(Tennison 2012; Persson and Savulescu 2012). They further argue that
moral enhancements will be required to establish enough cooperation
among societies to solve the problems of war, overpopulation, climate
change, pandemics, and other global crises that may drive human beings
into extinction. On broadly welfarist/utilitarian grounds, they
contend that there is a moral duty to develop and deploy moral
enhancement technologies to preserve human life on Earth.</p>

<p>
Critics argue that achieving the moral upgrades in the manner
suggested by Persson and Savulescu would require intrusive and
draconian social mechanisms: the very kinds of social control that
these moral enhancements were intended to render unnecessary (Sparrow
2014b; Harris 2016; Azevedo 2016). Others question the criteria by
which moral upgrades would be defined or measured (Joyce 2013; Craigie
2014; Wiseman 2016; Hauskeller and Coyne 2018; Johnson, Bishop and
Toner 2019; Paulo and Bublitz 2019). Would the morally enhanced still
be permitted to regard certain actions as supererogatory rather than
obligatory, or would more be expected of them? We need not aspire to
require superhuman virtues, such as angels might possess, but should
the morally enhanced at least be regarded as saints? If so, by whose
conception of sainthood? Once again, a panorama of alternative
philosophical traditions opens for exploration down this road,
offering no quick resolution for policy.</p>

<p>
It is also worth remembering that specific biomedical enhancements
will never yield comprehensive improvements in moral character, if
only because moral character is not reducible to the biological
substrates of brains and genes. At best, moral enhancement can modify
specific biological functions in ways that increase the chances that
acting in one manner (e.g. telling the truth) while decreasing the
chances of acting in another (like lying) which in certain contexts
may actually be the more virtuous thing to do. This double-edged
feature of biomedical enhancement means that every morally enhancing
intervention risks being, at the same time, a morally disabling
one.</p>

<p>
This observation suggests that, despite the claims of its defenders,
biomedical enhancement is not always well suited to a melioristic
ethic aimed at improving human welfare. Often a step forward for some
purposes is also a step back in other contexts. Many enhanced people
are, in corresponding ways, disabled &ndash; and the same may hold for their
teams, families, or communities. For example, an enhancement that
accelerates reflexes might benefit military pilots in combat but
significantly increase the risk of errors among commercial airline
pilots. This illustrates how enhancements involve context-dependent
trade-offs that are beneficial in one situation yet harmful or unfair
in others. If we focus our policies on recognizing that most
enhancements come with trade-offs, we might be able to orient our
public policy away from abstract regulatory or compensatory models of
&ldquo;enhancement&rdquo; and toward a focus on the specific social and
institutional contexts in which particular interventions might prove
too risky or unjust.</p>

<h2 id="DoEnhUndAut">5. Do Enhancements Undermine Authenticity?</h2>

<p>
Critics of biomedical enhancements often express concerns about
enhancements undermining authenticity. These concerns often express
the fear that enhancements could deprive persons of characteristics
essential to their sense of self &ndash; such as endurance, determination,
growth, faith, or luck &ndash; by substituting &ldquo;hollow victories&rdquo;
for authentic achievements. Critics argue that this loss of
authenticity diminishes personal character (Sandel 2007), alienates
humans from themselves and their communities (Agar 2013), and weakens
bonds of solidarity with those who choose not to enhance themselves
(Sparrow 2014). To translate these intuitive concerns into more
rigorous philosophical arguments, we must attend carefully to the
particular contexts in which the enhancements occur. For instance, the
authenticity concerns that arise when parents choose to enhance their
children differ markedly from those that emerge when adults choose to
enhance themselves. Likewise, therapeutic uses of the same
technologies may invite different authenticity considerations.
(Elliott 2011). In this section, we identify several central arguments
within this broader literature.</p>

<h3 id="AutAch">5.1 Authentic Achievements</h3>

<p>
One influential line of argument claims that biomedical enhancements
undermine authenticity because individuals cannot rightly claim
personal credit for accomplishments produced through such
interventions. According to this view, the biomedical interventions
that caused improvements in our capacities would supersede our own
agency in authoring the achievement (Kass 2003; Sandel 2007).
Defenders of this perspective argue that, whereas education, training,
and practice proceed through &ldquo;speech and deeds&rdquo; that are
comprehensible by those who are learning a new skill, biomedical
enhancements exert their effects on a subject who &ldquo;is not merely
passive but who plays no role at all. In addition, he can at best feel
their effects without understanding their meaning in human
terms&rdquo; (Kass 2003).</p>

<p>
One common reply to this argument is that when someone freely choses
to use an enhancement on the basis of reflection and deliberation, by
means of the &ldquo;speech and deeds&rdquo; that guide ordinary self-improvement,
it is unclear why the enhancement should be considered passive or
inauthentic (Kamm 2005). As Joshua May observes, &ldquo;mind-altering
drugs have likely proliferated throughout human cultures because they
promote meaningful and authentic improvements in creativity, bonding,
collaboration and group solidarity&rdquo; (May 2023). Moreover, just
as we hold those with enhanced abilities to higher standards of
responsibility for negligence and harm (Mehlman 2003), our
expectations for enhanced achievements may be correspondingly high
(Carter and Pritchard 2019). In both cases, however, the enhanced
agent&rsquo;s authorship of their achievements and agency in
self-improvement remain intact (Cole-Turner 1998).</p>

<p>
Critics of biomedical enhancements that appeal to considerations of
authenticity often acknowledge that enhanced individuals do author
their accomplishments, but they question whether those successes carry
the same value as &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;, unenhanced achievements
(Habermas 2003; Sandel 2007; Bublitz and Merkel 2009). They argue that
when a marathon runner gains endurance chemically rather than through
training, or when a mystic attains Nirvana through psychedelic therapy
rather than meditation, each misses something essential to the value
of the accomplishment. As Schermer (2008a) and Spitzley (2018) note,
the outcomes of such activities cannot be separated from the
activities themselves: their values lie in the processes they reward
as much as in the results they yield. For discussion of three &ldquo;easy
shortcut&rdquo; arguments of this kind, see Schermer 20008a and Moseley and
Murray 2023 for critical evaluation.</p>

<p>
Even if these criticisms show that unenhanced achievements are
valuable for reasons that are not shared by enhanced ones, they do not
establish that the unenhanced route is, overall, superior. They merely
establish that the two forms of achievement are valued differently.
Enhanced achievements may have their own distinctive worth.
Historically, the character-building struggles we admire seem adept at
keeping pace with our tools. From this perspective, biomedical
enhancements may serve as important new tools for self-creation that
we should consider embracing (DeGrazia 2000; Agar 2004). For a
detailed philosophical study of the nature and value of achievement,
see Bradford (2015).</p>

<h3 id="BeiTruOne">5.2 Being True to Oneself</h3>

<p>
In addition to these types of authenticity concerns, critics of human
enhancement argue that biomedical enhancements can, and often do,
threaten the authenticity or identity of individuals. Do enhancements
undermine the authentic self-authorship or personal identity?
Authenticity is widely understood to be a matter of being &ldquo;true
to oneself.&rdquo; Yet many contributors to these debates neglect to
clarify their assumptions about the nature of the self and what it
takes to be true to it &ndash; or to author oneself. As Lionel Trilling
(1971), Charles Taylor (2991) and Charles Guignon (2004) have
observed, it is no simple task to characterize the self to which
authentic individuals are true.</p>

<p>
These questions raise two broad categories of philosophical problems
typically classified as philosophical questions about personal
identity: metaphysical and practical problems (Schechtman 2007).
Metaphysical problems concern the criteria for being a person either
at a given time (synchronic identification questions) or over time
(diachronic identification questions). In contrast with metaphysical
questions about <em>what</em> it is to be a person, the practical
problems of personal identity that are primarily concerned with
<em>who</em> a person is (Schechtman 2007; Moseley 2012). The
practical questions of personal identity often emerge from the
first-person perspective, when one seriously asks, &ldquo;Who am
I?&rdquo;, and tend to surface in times of reflection on one&rsquo;s
deepest commitments. This type of reflection is often not an exercise
in philosophy: more often, it is an attempt to understand one&rsquo;s
own character and core commitments (Korsgaard 1996). The decisions and
choices that result from this kind of reflection are essential to the
processes of <em>self-discovery</em> and <em>self-creation</em>.</p>

<p>
This form of self-discovery is a creative and ongoing process of
reflecting on our moral experience and sharpening and re-valuating our
commitments. The concept of self-creation may seem paradoxical or
incoherent if it is understood as a metaphysical explanation of
one&rsquo;s relation to oneself. How can a person create, author, or
constitute themselves unless there is a self that already exists to do
the creating? The paradox is resolved if we understand
&lsquo;self&rsquo; in this context as referring to one&rsquo;s
<em>practical identity</em> (Korsgaard 1996; 2008). A practical
identify is &ldquo;a description under which you value yourself, a
description under which you find your life to be worth living and your
actions to be worth undertaking.&rdquo; (Korsgaard 1996) This
conception of personal identity is agnostic about the metaphysics of
personhood: it can apply equally to an immaterial soul or to a hard
deterministic vision of the activity of the human brain.</p>

<p>
Practical identities are both discovered and created by individuals.
Do biomedical enhancements undermine one&rsquo;s capacity to forge a
practical identity? One would need to look at each specific
enhancement technology to determine whether it would undermine that
capacity. For instance, if a &ldquo;pro-social enhancement&rdquo; were
to make someone more conformist, unreflective, or susceptible to
manipulation by advertising or political propaganda, it would clearly
compromise authenticity. Authentic persons usually reflectively affirm
their practical identities, their relationships to others, and to the
world that they inhabit (Moseley 2012). Enhancements that diminish or
eliminate those capacities would thereby undermine authenticity. These
considerations intersect with our earlier discussion of moral
enhancements in Section 4.2.</p>

<p>
Given the complexity of these debates, and the frequent conflation of
metaphysical and practical questions about personal identity and
self-creation, it is no surprise that little consensus exists
regarding whether enhancements undermine authenticity of the self. It
is also worth noting that some participants in these debates have
moved away from framing these issues as debates about personal
identity, since that terminology presupposes that we are essentially
persons. Animalists, who hold that we are fundamentally biological
organisms (<em>Homo sapiens</em>), reject that assumption. For those
sympathetic to the Animalist perspective, the arguments about moral
standing and status discussed in Section 6.2 offer an alternative
framework for addressing central ethical issues about the self in the
enhancement literature.</p>

<h2 id="EnhDeh">6. Are Enhancements Dehumanizing?</h2>

<h3 id="EnhThrHumNat">6.1 Enhancement Threats to Human Nature</h3>

<p>
In the background of the debates over the boundaries of medicine and
the ethics of self-improvement is a set of philosophical concerns
about what new biomedical enhancement technologies imply for our
shared understanding of human nature and the future of our species.
Critics often invoke &ldquo;dystopian nightmares,&rdquo; and worry
that enhancement interventions may rob us of central normative
features of our identity as human beings (Mehlman 2012). Francis
Fukuyama influentially argues that biomedical, especially genetic,
enhancements threaten our very humanity (Fukuyama 2002). Other
bioconservative critics, such as George Annas, go further and argue
that the use of genetic enhancements would be a crime against humanity
and demand the creation of a &ldquo;human species protection
treaty.&rdquo; (Annas 2005) They also contend that by taking human
evolution into our own hands and directing it towards the emergence of
a new species, we risk altering &ldquo;the essence of humanity
itself&rdquo; and thereby changing &ldquo;the foundation of human
rights.&rdquo; (Annas, et al. 2002)</p>

<p>
These concerns are supported by the language in the <em>Universal
Declaration of Human Rights</em>, which recognizes the inherent
dignity and &ldquo;equal and inalienable rights of all members of the
human family&rdquo; as the basis for &ldquo;freedom, justice and peace
in the world&rdquo; (United Nations General Assembly 1948). These
authors fear that genetic enhancement is likely to lead to the
emergence of post-humans who are more powerful than us and might
perpetrate crimes against humanity, such as enslavement or genocide.
Others, such as Habermas (2003), argue that the &ldquo;ethical
self-understanding of the species&rdquo; is jeopardized by genetic
selection or editing practices that parents might use in conceiving
and raising their children. These bioconservative arguments focus on
the concerns that enhancements will threaten moral equality, human
dignity, and human rights.</p>

<p>
By contrast, enhancement enthusiasts, often described as
<em>transhumanists</em>, welcome the possibility that biomedical
interventions might transform human nature for the better. Some even
look forward to the emergence of trans-humans or post-persons as the
next step in intentionally directed human evolution (Hughes 2004;
Harris 2007; Savulescu 2009). At stake in these debates is whether, or
how much, normative weight to assign to features of human nature that
have traditionally been taken as given (e.g., the families into which
we are born and our natural talents and abilities) or inevitable (such
as, pain and ageing), and whether those features of human nature place
morally significant limits on enhancement.</p>

<p>
Moral philosophy has a long history of making normative appeals to
human nature. Stevenson, et al. (2017) survey thirteen influential
accounts of human nature across Eastern and Western intellectual
traditions. There are thorny philosophical issues about whether such
appeals are ever legitimate. Ever since David Hume warned us to not
derive an &ldquo;ought&rdquo; from an &ldquo;is&rdquo;, moral
philosophers have been skeptical of making strong inferences about
what ought to be done directly from empirical claims about human
nature. However, virtue ethicists have been more comfortable with
adopting an empirical and naturalistic approach to human nature as the
basis for understanding what constitutes human well-being and
flourishing (Hursthouse 1999, Foot 2001). Explaining what is worth
cherishing about being human is an intuitive starting point for making
sense of ourselves, our relationships with other human beings, and our
place in the world. The task of getting clear about what we do and
should value about being human has important implications for the
ethics of human enhancements.</p>

<p>
Defenders of bioconservatism often emphasize three features of human
nature as especially worth preserving. The first feature is human
vulnerability. According to one prominent bioconservative view, human
beings are creatures that suffer, age and die, and our struggle to
deal with this vulnerability is a central aspect of what makes human
life valuable (Parens 1995, Habermas 2003). Within this camp, several
subgroups can be distinguished. &ldquo;Life cycle traditionalists&rdquo;
criticize ambitions to control the human ageing process or extend the
human life span (Callahan 1995). &ldquo;Personalists&rdquo; valorize the
ways in which human limitations are humbling and encourage modesty
(Fitzgerald 2008). &ldquo;Psychopharmaceutical Calvinists&rdquo; caution
against quick pharmacological fixes for melancholy or sadness (Elliot
1998). They warn that &ldquo;easy shortcuts&rdquo; corrode character,
diminish the inherent value of suffering, and diminish the complexity
and richness of human practices (Shermer 2008a; Moseley and Murray
2023). The second (set of) cherished features are embodiment and
species membership. Species preservationists and environmentalists
emphasize our biological embeddedness in nature and our place within a
particular evolutionary lineage. They contend that enhancements that
blur or bend &ldquo;species boundaries&rdquo; by attempting to direct evolution
endanger the integrity of both humanity and its ecological relations.
(McKibben 2004). The third feature is sociality. Human beings are
inherently social creatures that relate to one another through a
complex nexus of interpersonal relationships, commitments, and
hierarchical structures (Liao 2006a; Liao 2006b).</p>

<p>
Critics of bioconservatism argue that efforts to protect these
cherished human traits by trying to insulate human nature from
enhancement interventions are flawed in several ways. First, there is
little reason to believe that enhanced humans would lose their senses
of vulnerability, embodiment, connection with nature, or sociality.
These traits may manifest differently among post-humans, just as they
have evolved across human history. Indeed, transhumanists argue, there
are no static features of the human condition: human vulnerabilities
to our environment have steadily decreased over history, our moral
kinship communities have expanded, and our tolerance for oppressive
forms of social organization has dwindled (Savulescu 2009).
Accordingly, appeals to &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; in abstraction offer limited
guidance in deciding which vulnerabilities to preserve, which
loyalties to honor and respect, and which social structures to defend
and develop. Where a biomedical intervention alters one of these
dimensions of human nature, it signals that the moral stakes are high.
But those stakes are not always about what might be lost from the
human experience, but also what may be preserved or perpetuated.</p>

<p>
Second, even if preserving human nature in its current form were
desirable, banning enhancements cannot achieve this goal. As Juengst
observes, &ldquo;species are not static collections of organisms that
can be &lsquo;preserved&rsquo; against change like a can of fruit;
they wax and wane with every birth and death and their genetic
complexions shift across time and space&rdquo; (Juengst 2017). In our
case, almost everything we do influences this evolutionary process. To
argue that everyone has the right to inherit an &ldquo;untampered genome&rdquo;
only makes sense if one were to take a snapshot of the human gene pool
at a given instant and reify it as the sacred &ldquo;genetic patrimony
of humankind&rdquo;&mdash;an approach that some critics nearly adopt.
(Juengst 2009)</p>

<h3 id="MorStaMorSta">6.2 Moral Standing and Moral Status</h3>

<p>
As noted in Section 1.1, there is a persistent risk in enhancement
debates of conflating the biological and ethical senses of the term
&lsquo;human&rsquo;. In this debate, the risks are even greater, given
that the dispute rests on how to best understand being human. In the
biological sense, &lsquo;human&rsquo; refers to members of the species
<em>Homo sapiens</em>; to be human in this sense is to be a member of
that species. In the evaluative sense or moral sense,
&lsquo;human&rsquo; refers to being a member of the moral community
and having the accompanying moral rights that are owed to members of
that community. Buchanan (2013) discusses these conceptual issues as
part of an in-depth examination of the moral foundations of the
international legal human rights system (Buchanan 2013).</p>

<p>
One type of general objection to this debate, often from
post-modernist quarters, is that discussing human nature at all is an
intellectual faux pas, and that we are beyond this sort of
&ldquo;essentializing&rdquo; discussion (DeGrazia 2012). This
objection is weak. Even if there are no essential human properties, we
can still articulate a conception of human nature that identifies
characteristics most human beings share that are recalcitrant to being
removed or are significantly altered by education, training, or
indoctrination, and that play significant explanatory roles in both
widespread human behavior and differences between humans and other
animals (Buchanan 2011, DeGrazia 2012).</p>

<p>
It is also crucial to distinguish two possibilities that often become
conflated in these debates: (1) the emergence of new traits that are
the outcomes of genetic interventions that could produce a new
biological species, and (2) the emergence of individuals who would
constitute a new and superior kind of moral agent. The former would be
<em>Homo maximus</em>, whose qualitative difference from <em>Homo
sapiens</em> is vast (Degrazia 2012, 82). The latter would
yield <em>post-persons &ndash; </em>beings with higher moral status than
current moral agents. Buchanan (2011) and DeGrazia (2012) provide
careful treatments of these distinctions and their implications.</p>

<p>
In the context of debates about transhumanism, it is useful to
distinguish between moral standing and moral status, following Alan
Buchanan&rsquo;s influential framework (Buchanan 2011; 2013).
Individuals who have moral standing count morally in their own right.
For example, on hedonistic utilitarian grounds, sentient beings have
moral standing because they can experience pleasure and pain; for
Kantians, moral standing is conferred by the capacity for practical
reason. Whereas moral standing is a non-comparative notion, <em>moral
status</em> is comparative. It concerns the degree to which
individuals&rsquo; interests matter morally. Thus, both chickens and
humans possess moral standing as sentient creatures, but humans have
higher moral status because they possess greater capacities for
experiencing pleasure and pain and agency.</p>

<p>
We typically assume that human beings occupy the highest moral status
among earthly creatures. The possible emergence of post-humans or
post-persons could challenge our position in the hierarchy of moral
status. If post-humans have a higher moral status than current human
beings while retaining the same moral standing, what moral objections,
if any, could we raise? (Here it may be helpful to return to the
discussion of moral enhancement in Section 4.) The more troubling
possibility is that post-persons might have higher moral standing than
we do, thereby violating the widely held <em>moral equality
assumption:</em> the view that all moral agents share equal moral
status.</p>

<p>
Some transhumanists, such as James Hughes (2004), argue that we should
adopt a more optimistic and inclusive stance towards recognizing the
political and moral rights of cyborgs and post-humans in future
liberal democracies. Critics acknowledge that post-humans might
rightfully claim the same natural rights as current humans by virtue
of their capacities but argue that creating post-humans would
undermine the link between being human and human rights, much as the
discovery of rational extraterrestrials might. This shift could have
the effect of potentially disenfranchising some existing humans, such
as infants or persons with severe neurological disabilities, who
cannot demonstrate the functional capacities associated with moral
agency.</p>

<p>
At the same time, if the post-humans actually have enhanced cognitive
and moral capacities, they might claim expanded rights proportional to
those capacities, thereby entitling them to a broader range of
opportunities and freedoms than ordinary humans. This prospect risks
creating the very kinds of oppressive hierarchical societies that the
human rights tradition was designed to prevent, potentially paving the
way for new forms of coercive eugenics and even the eventual
extinction of the human species (Mehlman 2012; DeGrazia 2012).</p>

<p>
Susan Levin (2021) offers perhaps the most systematic analysis and
trenchant critique of transhumanism in the literature to date. She
challenges its core assumptions about the nature of the mind and
brain, its utilitarian commitments, its conception of liberal
democracy, and its rather crude scientism. Drawing on scientific and
philosophical arguments to make her case, she contends that we should
not devote our limited scientific and technological resources to the
enhancement project, which, she contends, is based on outdated and
empirically unsupported assumptions about cognitive psychology,
biology, and neuroscience.</p>

<h3 id="RevEug">6.3 Revisiting Eugenics</h3>

<p>
Just as it is metaphysically impossible to preserve our species from
further evolution, it is likewise impossible to control that process
&ldquo;from the inside out.&rdquo; The genetic constitution of our
species is continually shaped by environmental forces of selection
that lie beyond human abilities to control or even, as the phenomenon
of emerging epidemics continues to illustrate, anticipate. Moreover,
as disability-studies scholars observe, humanity is in no better
position today to decide which human traits deserve promotion than it
was during the heyday of the eugenics movement, even if society were
willing to tolerate the reproductive policies required to manage even
the human portion of evolutionary change (De Melo-Martin 2023).</p>

<p>
The unsettling resemblance between the aspirations of early
eugenicists and certain proposals advanced by contemporary
transhumanists, unfortunately, provides some evidence to support this
claim (Sparrow 2011, Levin 2021). Such proposals often assume that
some genotypes represent &ldquo;jewels in the genome&rdquo; (Sikela
2006) while others constitute costly &ldquo;toxic waste&rdquo; to be
cleansed from the gene pool (Buchanan, Brock, Wikler, and Daniels
2000). Critics argue that this way of thinking reduces persons to
their genotypes and undermines our commitment to moral equality amid
biological diversity (Asch and Block 2011).</p>

<p>
However difficult these arguments may be to reconstruct, it is
important to take seriously the concern that certain biomedical
interventions may violate human nature, even in public discussions of
policy within a pluralistic society. Whether the concern involves the
alteration of a constant of the human condition, like senescence; a
&ldquo;species altering&rdquo; threat to our collective gene pool; or
the corruption of practices designed to celebrate the inherited human
traits we value most, these appeals all signal that the intervention
in question has deep implications for who we want to become in light
of who we have been.</p>

<p>
Respecting what we have, or have not, inherited from our parents does
not, in itself, meet the need to decide which promises we want to make
to our children. Invocations of particular vulnerabilities, loyalties,
or forms of sociality drawn from the past can provide fodder for
positive visions of human nature to guide those promises. Yet in
communities that recognize a pluralism of such visions, these appeals
should also prompt another policy-making response: the obligation to
protect the interests of those excluded from prevailing ideals, even
while we debate their merits.</p>

<p>
The natural human gene pool has no top, bottom, edge, or direction: it
cannot be &ldquo;used up&rdquo;, &ldquo;diverted&rdquo;,
&ldquo;purified&rdquo; or &ldquo;polluted&rdquo;. The reservoir of
human mutual respect, good will and tolerance for difference, however,
seems perennially in danger of running dry. Those who emphasize the
fragility of human nature and its need for protection should remember
that not every aspect of our nature is admirable or worth
preserving.</p>

<h2 id="ConcMiliEnha">7. Conclusion: Military Enhancements</h2>

<p>
We shall conclude with a brief case study that illustrates many of the
ethical considerations discussed throughout this entry. Although we
have differentiated various conceptual and ethical issues raised by
enhancement, in practice these considerations are entangled to varying
degrees. Reflecting on whether military forces should use enhancement
technologies to achieve their goals engages with multiple dimensions
of the debate, including the treatment/enhancement distinction,
questions of fairness, moral enhancement, authenticity, and
dehumanization.</p>

<h3 id="ContMiliEnha">7.1 The Context of Military Enhancements</h3>

<p>
In recent years, the ethics of enhancement in military contexts has
attracted growing attention. Popular fascination with the topic of
super-soldiers is hardly new &ndash; dating back at least half a century to
<em>Captain America</em> comics, which themselves have inspired
philosophical reflection on virtue ethics and character (White 2014).
Outside of the lessons learned from pulp science fiction, there is a
longstanding history of military attempts to biologically enhance
soldiers&rsquo; combat effectiveness and chances of survival. The
history of warfare itself can be viewed as a history of enhancing
soldiers (Puscas 2020).</p>

<p>
Throughout this section, we use the terms &lsquo;soldier&rsquo;,
&lsquo;warfighter&rsquo; and &lsquo;military service-member&rsquo;
interchangeably, much to the chagrin of those who use these terms more
precisely within military institutions. In the United States, for
example, the term &lsquo;soldier&rsquo; refers specifically to members
of the Army, whereas in Europe it refers to all military personnel.
Here, we are deploying these terms in a broad and inclusive sense.</p>

<p>
Historical examples reveal the enduring tension between moral efficacy
and moral restraint. Legend has it that Celtic warriors eschewed body
armor (and sometimes even clothing!) in battle, thinking that it
diminished the glory of a true victory. By contrast, medieval knights
wore full suits of armor that emboldened them to charge into combat.
Indigenous peoples of the Orinoco basin (in present-day Brazil and
Venezuela) fought under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs that
played both ritual and psychological roles in combat, enhancing
courage and aggression (Puscas 2020). In modern times, pharmacological
enhancement has been common: methamphetamine use was widespread during
World War II, and as many as 70 percent of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam
reportedly used psychostimulants to boost endurance, strength, and
combat fatigue (Puscas 2020). Advances in vaccination and battlefield
medicine have also served to enhance soldiers&rsquo; resilience and
survival (Eagan 2020).</p>

<p>
Contemporary and near-future military enhancement efforts, however,
are more invasive than earlier technological or pharmacological
methods. The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) has been explicit about its interest in using biomedical
technologies to augment soldiers&rsquo; physical and cognitive
capacities. In a 2016 press release, DARPA announced a program on
&ldquo;Boosting Synaptic Plasticity to Accelerate Learning,&rdquo; noting
that &ldquo;unlike many of DARPA&rsquo;s previous neuroscience and
neurotechnology endeavors, <em>it will aim not just to restore lost
function but to advance capabilities beyond normal levels</em>.&rdquo;
(DARPA, 2016, <em>our italics</em>). Similarly, in 2017 DARPA invested
$100 million in gene-editing research with the hope of enabling
soldiers to &ldquo;run at super-human speeds, carry enormous weight,
live off their fat stores, and go without sleep.&rdquo; (Eagan
2020)</p>

<p>
These types of genetic and neurological enhancements, rather than
robotic or drone technologies, are the subject of this discussion.
While autonomous systems raise their own pressing ethical questions,
we focus here on bodily enhancements of human soldiers, or what we
shall call <em>military enhancements</em>.</p>

<h3 id="EthMilEnh">7.2 The Ethics of Military Enhancements</h3>

<p>
Military personnel operate within hierarchical institutions in which
individual autonomy and genuinely informed consent are constrained.
Soldiers often face institutional, social, or economic pressures to
accept enhancement interventions, effectively diminishing their
voluntary consent (Mehlman, et al. 2013). Autonomy is further limited
in contexts where refusal of an enhancement risks career setbacks or
loss of operational status (Lin, et al. 2013; Pfaff 2019). Beyond
explicit coercion, service members are embedded in a military ethos
that valorizes strength, sacrifice, and peak performance, making it
difficult to refuse enhancement even when participation appears
voluntary. Voluntary consent in these contexts is limited not only by
rank and command but also by internalized values and socialized
expectations to be the best warrior possible (Eagan 2020). This
pressure can be especially intense within elite units, where refusal
of a biomedical enhancement may be perceived as a lack of commitment
or even as a liability to the team. These dynamics contribute to the
emergence of a &ldquo;performance caste&rdquo; within the ranks
(Chneiweiss 2012). Moreover, the military&rsquo;s cultural framing of
the body as &ldquo;government-issued&rdquo;, reflected both in lore
and in disciplinary actions such as treating sunburn as the
&ldquo;destruction of government property&rdquo;, further undermines
bodily autonomy and complicates ethical assessments of consent. Even
in the absence of overt coercion, the structural, cultural, and
psychological dimensions of military life render true informed consent
highly suspect in enhancement contexts.</p>

<p>
Military enhancements also pose risks and side effects that may occur
during active service or long after discharge. Commonly used cognitive
enhancements, e.g., modafinil or psychostimulants, can impair
judgment, impulse control, and long-term psychological health (Lin, et
al. 2012) The neurological enhancements suggested by DARPA may pose
unknown and potentially irreversible harms on soldiers. These concerns
support arguments that military institutions have a duty of care to
protect soldiers from foreseeable biomedical risks (Moreno 2012).</p>

<p>
Military enhancements raise special concerns about fairness, both
within and between military forces. These concerns may arise between
enhanced and unenhanced soldiers within the same military institutions
or between military institutions, e.g., between one nation that has
enhanced soldiers and another nation that does not. Within a single
military organization, unequal access to enhancement technologies may
create unjust advantages for enhanced personnel (Lin, et al. 2013).
Enhanced soldiers might also face greater operational demands, such as
increased deployment tempo, leading to higher rates of trauma and
fatigue. Additional fairness issues arise from prospective genetic
screening in recruitment, which could exclude individuals based on
perceived disadvantage, reinforcing inequalities of &ldquo;the genetic
lottery&rdquo; (L&aacute;zaro-Mu&ntilde;oz, G., and E. Juengst,
2015). Beyond the service period, enhanced soldiers may face unique
challenges reintegrating into civilian life. While non-enhanced
veterans already confront difficulties transitioning to civilian
society (Shay 2011), reintegration may be especially complex for those
who are genetically, neurologically or robotically enhanced (Eagan
2022; Eagan and Moseley 2025). Traditionally, soldiers are standardly
required to return their government-issued firearms and gear upon
discharge. How could they, and should they, return their enhanced
brains or robotic limbs? The question of post-service ownership raises
new concerns about bodily integrity, medical autonomy, and the
potential for the continued state authority over persons&rsquo;
bodies. If military institutions retain control over enhancements,
dis-enhancement may be required at discharge: a practice that may
inflict medical and psychological harm.</p>

<p>
Military enhancements, especially pharmacological ones, also present
dual-use risks, which raise broader ethical concerns about unintended
outcomes on civilians. Technologies developed for combat applications
could be adapted by non-military forces for coercive purposes, e.g.,
interrogation (Moreno 2012). On an international scale, the
deployment of enhanced soldiers by one nation could trigger an
enhancement arms race, destabilizing norms governing permissible
warfare (DCDC, 2020; Mehlman, et al. 2013).</p>

<p>
Military enhancements that alter cognition or emotion could disrupt
the moral responsibility of soldiers who make decisions in combat.
Cognitive enhancements can alter judgment and decision-making
capacity, which may complicate attributions of moral responsibility in
warfare (Levy 2007). Intuitively, we are aware that people who stay
awake too long have diminished decision-making capacity. Soldiers who
have been enhanced to stay awake for vastly longer than normal periods
may thereby experience impaired decision-making capacities. As
Wolfendale (2008) argues, military personnel need to be morally
responsible agents and moral responsibility is necessary for integrity
and the moral emotions of guilt and remorse, which are central to
moral growth and psychological well-being. She contends that military
enhancements that diminish soldiers&rsquo; capacity to experience
these emotions would undermine the moral standing of the military and
harm the well-being of warfighters. Relatedly, military enhancements
that alter mood, memory, or empathy raise concerns about their impact
on personal identity, personality and authenticity. Some argue that
heavily enhanced soldiers may no longer be the same persons after
receiving the enhancements (Moreno 2012), or that the enhancements may
lead soldiers to doubt whether their achievements and actions are
genuinely their own (Mehlman, et al. 2013). Addressing such questions
requires greater conceptual precision in distinguishing among
philosophical notions of identity, selfhood, and authenticity, as
discussed earlier in this entry.</p>

<p>
Finally, like the treatment/enhancement distinction in medicine,
military enhancements face a slippery conceptual distinction with
important ethical consequences. Traditionally, the Just War theories
that undergird military ethics have eschewed the use of
disproportionately destructive offensive innovations, from crossbows
in the medieval period to carpet bombing and chemical weapons in
modern warfare, while generally accepting defensive innovations such
as stronger armor and more effective anti-missile systems. How, then,
should we assess a project like DARPA&rsquo;s PREPARE (PRemptive
Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements) [Other
Internet Resources], which seeks to develop gene-editing interventions
to confer soldiers with resistance to radiation and chemical agents
beyond the normal human range? These innovations would be enhancements
by most criteria and raise many of the moral and philosophical issues
surveyed throughout this entry.</p>
