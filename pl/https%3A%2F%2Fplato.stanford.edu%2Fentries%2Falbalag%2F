<h1>Isaac Albalag</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Aug 20, 2020; substantive revision Wed Jul 2, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Isaac Albalag stands out as one of the most rigorous representatives
of the Jewish Averroism school which flourished in Western Europe in
the thirteenth century and continued until the Renaissance. This
school contained notable figures such as Ibn Kaspi, Shem Tov Ibn
Falaquera, Moses Narboni, Isaac Polqar, Gersonides, and Elijah
Delmedigo who regarded Averroes&rsquo; philosophical writings,
particularly his commentaries on Aristotle, as the primary sources for
studying science and philosophy. Averroes&rsquo; influence on these
philosophers extended to the question of the relationship between
religion and philosophy. Many Jewish philosophers, drawing on
Averroes&rsquo; religious epistemology, which established a
theoretical basis for reading Scripture and demonstrative sciences as
different representations of the same truth rather than conflicting
truths, sought to interpret Judaism as a philosophical religion, a
philosophical-theological approach that was arguably championed by the
prominent Jewish philosopher Maimonides (d.1204). Characteristically,
Albalag displays unreserved admiration and fidelity to Aristotle whose
teachings, as interpreted by Averroes, he considers synonymous with
the truth. Restoring Aristotelianism and establishing it among Jewish
students of philosophy are central goals of Albalag&rsquo;s
philosophical project. Within this framework, Albalag addresses the
critical question of the relationship between Judaism and philosophy,
uniquely advocating the doctrine of double truth.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Little is known about Isaac Albalag. All we know about him is that he
lived in the second half of the thirteenth century either in Catalonia
or Provence (Sirat 1985: 238). References to Albalag in
fifteenth-century Spanish Jewish literature suggest that he did not
enjoy a good reputation, as his name appears in some sources
associated with critiques and accusations of heresy. For example, the
Kabbalist Shem Tov Ibn Shem Tov (d.1440) accuses Albalag of espousing
a heretical view regarding the fate of the soul after death (<em>Sefer
ha &#702;emunot</em> [the Book of Beliefs], I:1). Similarly, in
<em>Sefer Neveh Shalom</em> (Indwelling of Peace), the
fifteenth-century Spanish thinker Abraham Shalom condemns
Albalag&rsquo;s account of celestial motion, which he believes
radically undermines the doctrine of creation (Vajda 1960: 271).
Albalag&rsquo;s worth as a philosopher did not go unappreciated,
notwithstanding. His younger contemporary Isaac Polqar
(14<sup>th</sup> century), the author of <em>&#703;Ezer ha-dat</em>
(The Support of Faith), holds Albalag in great esteem, citing him
approvingly in his treatment of the controversial issue of the origin
of the world (<em>&#703;Ezer ha-dat</em>: part II: p.46. For
Polqar&rsquo;s treatment of the origin of the world see Haliva 2018
).</p>

<p>
Albalag wrote only one treatise, <em>Sefer Tiqqun ha de&#703;ot</em>
(The Emendation of the Opinions)&mdash; using Manekin&rsquo;s
translation of the title (Manekin 2007: 140). This treatise is a
translation, accompanied by a commentary, of Abu Hamid
al-Ghazali&rsquo;s encyclopedic treatise <em>kit&#257;b
Maq&#257;&#7779;id al-Fal&#257;sifah</em> (The Aims of the
Philosophers), specifically the sections on Logic and Metaphysics. The
third part on Natural Philosophy was completed by Isaac Polqar (Vajda
1960: 268).</p>

<p>
The composition of the <em>Tiqqun</em> was driven by two goals. As the
title (Emendation of the Opinions) suggests, the main goal was to
offer philosophical corrections. Albalag believed that most errors in
philosophical discourse stemmed from deviation from or
misunderstanding of the teachings of Aristotle. He particularly
regarded Avicenna as a major source of such errors, and thus developed
several anti-Avicennian critiques. Although Avicenna is central to
Albalag&rsquo;s corrective enterprise, criticism is extended also to
other figures such as al-Farabi, Maimonides, and al-Ghazali. It is
likely that Albalag, like Medieval Latin philosophers, considered
<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id al-Fal&#257;sifah</em> a genuine representation
of al-Ghazali&rsquo;s philosophical opinions (for al-Ghazali&rsquo;s
philosophical image in Latin literature, see Shihadeh 2011).
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Since <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id al-Fal&#257;sifah</em> offered a concise
presentation of the opinions of the philosophers, it furnished Albalag
with an ideal framework for pursuing the announced process of
&ldquo;emendation&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em>). In most of his
discussions, critiques, and corrections Albalag derived what he
considered the correct understanding of Aristotle from Averroes&rsquo;
writings. </p>

<p>
The second goal of the <em>Tiqqun</em> is pedagogical. Once again,
al-Ghazali&rsquo;s <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id al-Fal&#257;sifah</em>
serves as an adequate vehicle for this purpose. Al-Ghazali&rsquo;s
clear and accessible style, which resonates with &ldquo;popular
beliefs&rdquo;, makes the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em> a suitable
medium for instructing students with limited philosophical background
(<em>Tiqqun</em> preface: 4). By translating and commenting on
al-Ghazali&rsquo;s <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, Albalag aims to offer
a step-by-step instruction in philosophy, starting with a presentation
of Ghazali&rsquo;s summary of the doctrines of the philosophers and
progressing towards the establishment of Aristotelian demonstrative
doctrines. Overall, the <em>Tiqqun</em> follows the structure of the
<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, although Albalag occasionally diverges
into extensive digressions.</p>

<h2 id="Logi">2. Logic</h2>

<p>
The first part of the <em>Tiqqun</em> (Logic) is a mostly faithful
translation of the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id.</em> While this part
section is generally unoriginal, it can be credited with a specific
contribution. The manuscripts of the <em>Tiqqun</em> include a
sympathetic discussion of the fourth figure of syllogism. This figure
was attributed by most Medieval logicians to Galen, although this
attribution remains disputed in modern scholarship (Rescher 1965;
Sabra 1965), and was dismissed as lacking utility and
&ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; by Averroes (see Gersonides <em>Sefer
ha-heqqesh ha-Yashar </em> [The Book of the Correct Syllogism]: 147).
However, it is unclear whether Albalag himself wrote this discussion
or it was authored by Abner of Burgos, a thirteenth-century
Jewish-convert-to-Christianity philosopher, as suggested by some
textual evidence (Vajda 1960: 275&ndash;276). If Albalag himself
included this interpolation in the <em>Tiqqun</em>, without any
explicit criticism, that would indicate that Albalag agreed with its
positive assessment of the fourth figure of the syllogism.</p>

<p>
According to Aristotle, syllogisms are composed of two predicative
sentences sharing a common (middle) term and two distinct terms (minor
and major). He arranges the premises in three figures as follows: </p>

<ul>

<li> in the first figure, the middle term is subject in one premise
and predicate in the other, </li>

<li> in the second, it is subject in both premises, and </li>

<li> in the third, it is predicate in both (Manekin 1996: 50).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some later logicians distinguished the order of the major and minor
premises with the result that the first figure was divided into two
figures: </p>

<ul>

<li>in the first, the middle term is the subject in the minor and
predicate in the major premises, and </li>

<li> in the second, it is the subject in the major and the predicate
in the minor premises (<em>ibid</em>, 1996: 50). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The additional fourth figure &ldquo;is sometimes placed after the
first figure, rather than the third&rdquo; (<em>ibid</em>, 1996:
50).</p>

<p>
The <em>Tiqqun</em> provides a quasi-defense of the fourth figure as a
&ldquo;valuable&rdquo; form of reasoning (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.5:12).
This interrupts Albalag&rsquo;s overall adherence to Averroes who,
like the majority of Medieval logicians, rejects the fourth figure due
to concerns about its &ldquo;naturalness.&rdquo; According to
Averroes, &ldquo;the form of reasoning embodied in the fourth figure
of syllogism does not exist in us by nature&rdquo; and involves
&ldquo;absurd self-predication&rdquo; (Manekin 1996: 56). In Hebrew
logical writings, limited attempts were advanced to support that
figure, most notably by Gersonides. The discussion in the
<em>Tiqqun</em> represents another effort in this direction, where the
author subjects even Aristotle to criticism for omitting this form of
reasoning (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.5: 12).</p>

<h2 id="Epis">3. Epistemology</h2>

<h3 id="KnowBeliIntePerf">3.1 Knowledge, Belief and Intellectual Perfection</h3>

<p>
Like most Medieval Aristotelians, Albalag understands the ultimate
goal of man in terms of intellectual perfection (<em>Tiqqun</em>
preface: 2&ndash;3, n.30: 42; cf. Maimonides, <em>Guide</em> III:54;
Farabi, <em>Selected Aphorisms</em>: 61; Averroes, <em>Epistle on the
Possibility of Conjunction</em>: 103). Achieving this goal requires
acquiring knowledge of existents in a manner &ldquo;that dispels
doubt&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em> preface: 3). The phrase
&ldquo;dispelling doubt&rdquo; points to the conception of certainty
(<em>yaq&#299;n)</em>, which, in the Arab Aristotelian tradition, is
defined as a cognitive state in which the cognizer acquiesces that
what she perceived is necessarily true and cannot be otherwise (see
Black 2006: 15&ndash;25). In line with this tradition, Albalag
specifies the logical tool of demonstration as <em>the</em> means to
the fulfilment of the criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e., attaining
certainty) (<em>Tiqqun</em> preface: 3&ndash;4). This implies that
achieving the ultimate goal of man is exclusively tied to philosophy,
whereas religion, which generally conveys knowledge via
non-demonstrative methods, plays no substantial role in this regard.
This implication becomes evident from a dichotomy that Albalag draws
between <em>&#702;emunah</em> (belief) and <em>yedi&#703;ah</em>
(scientific knowledge), confining the former to religion/Scripture.
Whether <em>&#702;emunah</em> qualifies to parallel or substitute
philosophy in fulfilling the epistemic requirement for intellectual
perfection is a complex question (for a detailed discussion of this
point, see Abdalla 2025, 53&ndash;68). One factor to consider is that
the conception of <em>&#702;emunah</em> in the <em>Tiqqun</em> varies
from the philosophical conception of belief (for which
<em>&#702;i&#703;tiq&#257;d</em> and <em>ta&#7779;d&#299;q</em> were
the technical terms) espoused by many Jewish and Muslim philosophers
and theologians (see, for instance, al-Farabi <em>Book of
Demonstration</em>: 63&ndash;4; Saadya Gaon <em> The Book of Doctrines
and Beliefs</em>: 34; Maimonides <em>Guide</em> I:50). The latter
conception involves a judgment or affirmation, derived from cognitive
processes and syllogistic reasoning, that a given perceived object is
true. Belief in this sense is associated with certainty or
approximation of certainty depending on the form of reasoning.</p>

<p>
The <em>Tiqqun</em>, in contrast, points to a traditional conception
of belief; one that involves the simple acceptance of a given
scriptural doctrine or set of doctrines as true, without prior
rational justification (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 51; for background on
the traditional conception of belief in Jewish thought see Wolfson
1942: 213&ndash;261; Kellner 1986; Rosenberg 1984: 273&ndash;307),).
While it might be argued that simple belief can serve as a source of
certainty due to prophetic authority, and thus can contribute to
fulfilling the epistemological requirements for intellectual
perfection, Albalag displays a skeptical stance toward prophetic
knowledge that ultimately challenges this view. In the
<em>Tiqqun</em>, we come across remarks stressing the inaccessibility
of the Torah&rsquo;s prophetic secrets to non-prophets &mdash;we will
see below that the Torah has two layers of esoteric knowledge, one of
which is prophetic and the other is philosophical. Only philosophical
knowledge is accessible to non-prophets through allegorical
interpretation of Scripture in terms of what they learned from
demonstrative sciences (see below). The assent evoked by Scripture in
someone proficient in demonstrative sciences (i.e., a philosopher)
amounts to reason-based, namely demonstrative, assent (cf. Averroes
<em>Decisive Treatise</em>: 17&ndash;18). Therefore, associating
Scripture solely with simple belief (<em>&#702;emunah
peshu&#7789;ah</em>) would be incomprehensible, unless we grant that
belief pertains only to the surface layer of Scripture to which assent
requires no extra interpretive or rational effort. However, this would
imply that belief has little epistemic value, since it is linked to a
scriptural layer that, as Albalag maintains, addresses the multitude
of people who, &ldquo;like animals&rdquo;, lack reason
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 45).</p>

<h3 id="HumaKnowMeanLimi">3.2 Human Knowledge: Means and Limits</h3>

<p>
Although Albalag does not devote a specific discussion to the theory
of knowledge, the <em>Tiqqun</em> include remarks about human
knowledge, its features and limits, and the means to it, most of which
show indebtedness to Aristotelian epistemological theories as
developed by Arab Aristotelians, in particular Averroes. Following the
standard definition of knowledge within the framework of Arabic
Aristotelianism, Albalag divides knowledge into representation and
assent. The former, which is a prerequisite for the latter, is
acquired by definition, while assent is acquired through proof
(<em>Tiqqun</em> [Logic]: 98; cf. <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 12). As
noted previously, Albalag assigns a primary significance to
demonstrative syllogisms in evoking certain assent. Moreover, like
Averroes, Albalag highlights the empirical foundation of human
knowledge (for Averroes&rsquo; epistemology see Black 2019). As he
explains, intelligible thoughts arise in the soul through the
cognitive processes of abstraction and syllogistic reasoning. Without
external images, the soul cannot apprehend intelligible forms, just as
a person deprived of visual data cannot apprehend the quiddity of
colors (<em>Tiqqun</em>, n.11: 16, n.44: 71; cf. Aristotle <em>De
Anima</em> III, 7, 431a, 14&ndash;17).</p>

<p>
Although the <em>Tiqqun</em> is generally characterized by confident
rationalism, it involves skeptical elements that echo
Maimonides&rsquo; critiques of the limitation of the human intellect
with respect to metaphysical knowledge (for these critiques in
Maimonides see Pines 1979; Stern 2013). Albalag admits, like
Maimonides, that attaining <em>complete</em> knowledge of immaterial
beings lies beyond the capacity of the human intellect. This
limitation is primarily due to the material component of human beings
(<em>&#7717;omer</em>), which serves as both a constant impediment to
the pursuit of knowledge and a cause of intellectual deficiency
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.11: 16, n.38: 58; cf. <em>Guide</em> III:9).</p>

<h2 id="ConcBeinGodsExis">4. Conception of Being and God&rsquo;s Existence</h2>

<p>
Avicenna&rsquo;s proof of God&rsquo;s existence, famously known as
&ldquo;<em>Burh&#257;n al-&#7779;idiqin</em>&rdquo; (Demonstration of
the Truthful (Mayer 2001)) occupies a significant portion of
Albalag&rsquo;s critical discussion. Avicenna presents this proof as a
metaphysical argument for the existence of God, emphasizing its
inclusion within the science of metaphysics and reliance on analyses
of the conception of existence qua existence. He divides
&ldquo;actual&rdquo; beings into those that are necessary in
themselves and those that are possible in themselves but necessary
through another (Davidson 1987: 292&ndash;3; McGinnis 2010:
159&ndash;164). The necessary in itself is that which has existence as
part of its essence and an impossibility arises if it is assumed not
to exist. The possible in itself but necessary through another is that
which &ldquo;has no existence in essence&rdquo; and &ldquo;no
impossibility&rdquo; arises whether it is assumed to exist or not
(Avicenna <em>al-Naj&#257;t</em>: 2:77; cf.
<em>al-&#702;ishar&#257;t</em>: 122; cf. al-Ghazali
<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 100&ndash;101); both existence and
non-existence are equal states with respect to it. Accordingly, an
external cause must act to preponderate the state of existence over
non-existence in a possible thing. Let us consider all possible things
as an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; (<em>jumlah)</em>. This raises two
assumptions: (1) the aggregate is self-caused, or (2) the aggregate is
caused by an external cause (Avicenna, <em>al-Naj&#257;t</em>: 2: 89).
Avicenna excludes the former assumption, explaining that the nature of
what is possible in itself cannot change without a cause. Hence, an
aggregate of possible things remains possible in itself; it must be
caused by another cause to become necessary. Given that the series of
causes and effects cannot progress <em>ad infinitum</em>, we must
conclude that the existence of an aggregate of possible things relies
on a cause that is necessary in itself, that is, a cause that requires
no cause for its existence, but on whose existence all other existents
ultimately depend. The trait of &ldquo;necessary existence&rdquo;
entails a number of divine attributes such as oneness, simplicity and
goodness, which permits identifying the Necessary Existent with the
deity (Adamson 2013: 172).</p>

<p>
Albalag finds Avicenna&rsquo;s proof of God as Necessary Existent open
to criticism due to its deviation from Aristotle on some crucial
points. Firstly, Albalag argues that Avicenna&rsquo;s method for
establishing the existence of the First Principle in the science of
metaphysics is incorrect (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.8: 13&ndash;14). In
contrast to Avicenna, Albalag contends that the existence of the Prime
Mover must be accepted from natural philosophy. However, the
metaphysician should not accept the Prime Mover as the deity outright;
rather, he must devote further effort to examine its states and
attributes to determine whether the Prime Mover is indeed the deity.
The theoretical basis for Albalag&rsquo;s objection to Avicenna is
Aristotle&rsquo;s rule that &ldquo;no master of any art can
demonstrate the proper principles of his art&rdquo;
(<em>Metaphysics</em> IV 1003a21&ndash;22). According to Averroes,
this rule suggests that a given science does not demonstrate the
existence of its subject, but must concede to its existence either as
something which is &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; or as &ldquo;something
that has been demonstrated in another science&rdquo; (Wolfson
1950&ndash;1 : 691). Since the First Principle is the subject matter
of metaphysics, its existence cannot be established in this
science.</p>

<p>
Secondly, Avicenna breaks away from Aristotle as he proceeds in
establishing the existence of the First Principle through an analysis
of the conception of being, rather than motion and moved objects, as
Aristotle does (for Aristotle&rsquo;s argument see <em>Physics</em> 7
&amp; 8). To establish the Necessary Existent, Avicenna proceeds from
a conception of being that Albalag dismisses as spurious (cf.
Averroes, <em>al-kashf</em>: 14). Albalag&rsquo;s discomfort with this
approach primarily stems from the fact that it deviates from
Aristotle&rsquo;s method. Moreover, Albalag points out errors and
implications, particularly in the science of metaphysics, that arise
from Avicenna&rsquo;s method of distinguishing two types of necessary
existents: that which is necessary in itself and that which is
necessary by another. For instance, Albalag argues that if we accept
Avicenna&rsquo;s view that anything not necessary in itself involves
both necessity and possibility, then separate intellects would also
involve both necessity and possibility. However, since possibility
resides in a substratum, this would absurdly undermine the nature of
separate intellects as essentially immaterial beings (<em>Tiqqun</em>
n.8: 14, n.29: 27).</p>

<p>
These deviations from Aristotle provided Albalag with sufficient
reason to reject the metaphysical proof of God. Moreover, from
Albalag&rsquo;s perspective, Avicenna&rsquo;s supplementary arguments,
reproduced by al-Ghazali in the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, that the
Necessary Existent is one, simple and incorporeal fall short of
satisfying the epistemic criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e.,
certainty). In contrast, Aristotle&rsquo;s argument from motion which,
as Albalag asserts, &ldquo;dispels doubt&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.33:
53. For further discussion of Albalag&rsquo;s criticism of these
argument, see Abdalla 2024). However, although Albalag only trusts
Aristotle&rsquo;s argument, he points to a subtle problem rooted in
ancient commentaries on Aristotle: the problem of the relation of the
Prime Mover to the deity (for this problem see Avicenna
<em>Shif&#257;&#702;</em> [<em>Metaphysics</em>]: 13).
Aristotle&rsquo;s argument from motion leads to the existence of a
mover that is not a body or a force in a body. But whether that mover
is the First Principle/Cause, i.e., the deity, or a first effect
remained an open question to philosophers (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.8: 14,
n.38: 61). While Avicenna concludes that the deity is ontologically
superior to the Prime Mover known from Aristotle&rsquo;s analyses of
motion (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.38: 61), Averroes identifies the Prime Mover
with the deity in his writings (see for instance <em>Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s
Metaphysics </em>: 172)&mdash;the exception being, as Albalag
correctly notes, the <em>Epitome of Metaphysics</em> (see
<em>Talkh&#299;&#7779; m&#257; ba&#703;d al-&#7789;abi&#703;ah</em>:
149) where Averroes follows Avicenna&rsquo;s standpoint
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.69: 96).</p>

<p>
Curiously, Albalag does not immediately align himself with either
camp. However, his discussion of the relation of the Prime Mover to
the celestial and sublunary realms ultimately supports Averroes&rsquo;
standpoint, since it establishes the primacy of the Prime Mover as the
cause of all sublunary and celestial entities, and its absolute unity
and simplicity&mdash;the most essential specifications of the deity
(see below).</p>

<h2 id="GodWorlRela">5. God-world Relationship</h2>

<p>
To reconstruct a rough picture of Albalag&rsquo;s understanding of the
God-world relationship, we consider three themes: the origin of the
world, divine will, and divine wisdom.</p>

<h3 id="OrigWorl">5.1 The Origin of the World</h3>

<p>
On philosophical grounds, Albalag dismisses the doctrine of temporal
origination as &ldquo;defective&rdquo; and accepts the eternal
existence of the universe as an indisputable truth (interestingly, he
still accepts the former on the authority of Scripture, as will be
shown later). However, Albalag attempts to present the Aristotelian
theory of eternity and its fundamental premises in a theologically
appealing fashion. Instead of describing the world as eternally
existent, Albalag introduces the theory of &ldquo;eternal
origination&rdquo; (<em>&#7717;id&#363;sh ni&#7779;i&#7717;i</em>),
explaining that &ldquo;there was no time at which the universe was not
originated&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 30). As can be seen, this
theory combines two seemingly inconsistent assumptions about the
universe: (1) That the universe has no temporal beginning, and (2)
that the universe is originated. Albalag accepts the former based on
Aristotle&rsquo;s demonstration of the perpetual existence of
celestial spheres and their motion (see for instance <em>Tiqqun</em>,
n.30: 30, 60:84&ndash;97; cf. <em>De Caelo</em> I: 2&ndash;3). To
verify the latter, he devotes an entire chapter in which he explains
that the universe is not self-sufficient and that it necessarily
relies for its eternal existence and continuation on a cause. In
addition to philosophical explanation he offers scriptural exegesis
showing that the theory of eternal origination is compatible with the
esoteric meaning of Scripture (for this exegesis, see Feldman 2000:
19&ndash;30). These philosophical and interpretive notes enable
Albalag to ultimately redress what he considers a common mix-up of the
philosophical doctrine of eternity with the Epicurean view that
&ldquo;the universe exists without a cause&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em>
n.30: 45), and to defend the philosophers against charges of heresy
leveled against them on the assumption that they deny the
universe&rsquo;s dependence on a divine cause that creates it and
sustains its existence. </p>

<p>
Albalag&rsquo;s discussion of the eternal origination of the universe
alludes to elements of al-Ghazali&rsquo;s refutation of the
philosophers in <em>Tah&#257;fut al-Fal&#257;sifah</em>. Al-Ghazali
contends that the philosopher&rsquo; exposition of the relation of God
to the universe is based on two contradictory assumptions: that the
universe is eternal and that it has a Maker (see <em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Fal&#257;sifah</em> third and tenth discussions). As seen, Albalag
maintains, contrary to al-Ghazali, that these premises are consistent,
and thus the philosophers&rsquo; adherence to the theory of eternal
origination is immune to criticism. Indeed, Albalag insists that the
theory of eternal origination constitutes a more adequate way for
articulating divine causation than the doctrine of temporal
origination, the &ldquo;defective&rdquo; doctrine of the multitude.
This temporal view confines God&rsquo;s creation of the world to a
specific time in the past, which is incompatible with the
characteristics of divine perfection. If perfection implies
absoluteness, the Creator&rsquo;s action must be free from temporal
limitations. Accordingly, His act of creation can only be eternal,
rather than temporal. </p>

<p>
In explaining the mechanism of eternal origination, Albalag introduces
a conception of the universe as a moving entity in which the
cause-effect relationship is a relation between a mover and a moved
object (see <em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 29; cf. <em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Tah&#257;fut</em>: third discussion, 101). In the natural realm,
all processes of generation and corruption consist in motion&mdash;for
instance the movement from potential to actual existence&mdash;and
occurs through motion. All natural changes depend on the movements of
the celestial spheres, which in turn depend on the mover of the
outermost sphere, the Prime Mover (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 29, n.39:
62).</p>

<p>
Beyond this well-known Aristotelian conception of the Prime Mover as
the ultimate cause of motion, Albalag seeks to establish the idea of
the creator, without compromising his faithfulness to Aristotelian
principles. To this end, he argues that the very act of producing
motion is sufficient to make the Prime Mover a cause/creator of the
universe. Albalag differentiates between two classes of existents:
</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>existents whose subsistence requires motion, and </li>

<li> existents whose subsistence <em>does not</em> require motion;
only their generation requires motion. </li>
</ol>

<p>
The key difference between the two classes of existents lies in the
duration of their dependence on the cause of motion. The latter class
depends on the cause of motion only for their generation, but they can
continue to exist after the cause has perished &mdash;for instance, a
house continues to exist after the death of its builder. In contrast,
existents in the former class are intrinsically linked to motion and
vanish as soon as motion stops&mdash;for instance wind ceases to exist
as soon as the air becomes still (<em>Tiqqun</em> 30: 30; cf. Averroes
<em>Tah&#257;fut al-Tah&#257;fut</em>, fourth discussion:
156&ndash;8). Given their essential association with motion, such
existents are said to need a cause more than any others, for if the
cause of motion disappears from existence &ldquo;for a twinkling of an
eye&rdquo;, they will perish (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 30). Albalag
maintains that the universe as a whole belongs to the class of
existents whose continued existence depends on motion, concluding that
the Mover that perpetuates its motion is its Cause of existence
(<em>Tiqqun</em>, n.30: 30. For further discussion of the details of
the theory of eternal generation and the causal role of the Prime
Mover, see Abdalla 2025, 215&ndash;224). </p>

<h3 id="DiviWill">5.2 Divine Will</h3>

<p>
Albalag addresses the contentious issue of the nature of divine will
within the framework of the theory of eternal generation. This
discussion also bears elements reminiscent of al-Ghazali&rsquo;s
critique of the philosopher&rsquo;s opinions in <em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Fal&#257;sifah</em>, where the main point of contention is the
nature of divine causation. Al-Ghazali considers volition a
fundamental characteristic of any acting cause. In his opinion, an
acting cause, or an agent, must be willing, in the sense of knowing
and choosing &ldquo;what is willed&rdquo; (<em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Fal&#257;sifah</em>, third discussion: 135). A cause that acts by
necessity, that is, without willing, falls into the category of
natural, involuntary causes. With this conception of agency in mind,
al-Ghazali accuses the philosophers of denying divine will,
particularly due to their support of the eternity scheme, which
entails the idea of causal necessity. According to al-Ghazali, the
philosophers maintain that the universe perpetually proceeds from God
by necessity in the same manner that light proceeds from sun by
necessity (<em>Tah&#257;fut</em>, third discussion: 135; cf.
<em>Tiqqun</em> n.23: 24). Unlike al-Ghazali, Albalag sees no conflict
between ascribing volition to God and upholding the the eternity
scheme. This perspective is evident in the way Albalag responds to a
question about causality in his discussion of the theory of eternal
generation: Are natural and involuntary causes the actual doers of
effects? In this context, Albalag broadens the conception of agency to
include both involuntary/natural and voluntary causes. However, he
emphasizes that natural/involuntary causes are not autonomous
producers of effects, as their casual efficacy is primarily indebted
to close or remote voluntary causes. For example, a sword can kill a
person. However, it does not kill that person on its own, as it is
primarily employed by a voluntary cause for this purpose. Yet both the
sword and the voluntary cause are considered actual agents in the act
of killing. In light of this understanding of causal relations,
Albalag states that the Prime Mover, being the prime cause of all
movements taking place in the natural and celestial realms, is the
First Maker of all effects. In its context, this statement aims to
confirm, contrary to the accusations of al-Ghazali, that the Prime
Mover is the ultimate voluntary cause of the universe. Nonetheless,
apart from this brief explanation of the God-world causal relationship
in terms of motion, Albalag barely ascribes any active role to divine
will in the perpetual generation of the world.</p>

<p>
In other contexts, Albalag offers some reflections on the nature of
divine causation, rejecting associating God with natural and voluntary
actions. In his view, God&rsquo;s actions are neither natural not
voluntary but belong to a unique, intermediary class of actions that
lies beyond human understanding. This does not mean, however, that God
is deprived of volition; rather God has a capacity analogous to what
will constitutes for human beings. The exact nature of this capacity,
which human beings call will, is obscure, though demonstration
establishes its existence. Nonetheless, considering the defining
criteria of divine perfection, Albalag infers that this capacity
shares no features with empirical will. Unlike empirical will which is
driven by external incentives and seeks to fulfill desires, divine
will is self-sufficient. While empirical will is temporal and perishes
as soon as the desired outcome is achieved, divine will is eternal and
immutable, being characterized as a benevolent and immutable capacity
to eternally &ldquo;choose&rdquo; the best of two opposite options:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Even though He possesses power over everything, His will constantly
attaches itself to a single object, the best among two opposites.
Certainly, if He willed evil He would be capable of doing it, but His
will desires nothing but the good only. (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.23: 24 [my
translation]; cf. <em>Guide</em> III:25 where Maimonides states that
God acts in the best way; cf. Averroes, <em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Tah&#257;fut</em>, first discussion: 22) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this basis, the universe maintains a fixed natural order such that
&ldquo;nothing can be added to or reduced from it&rdquo;
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 39), since God&rsquo;s will continuously and
immutably chooses this order.</p>

<h3 id="DiviKnow">5.3 Divine Knowledge</h3>

<p>
The possession of will by God presupposes His possession of knowledge,
as choosing among alternatives requires knowing them. When discussing
the nature of divine knowledge, Albalag emphasizes the importance of
meeting the criteria for divine perfection. For this reason, he
distinguishes divine knowledge from human knowledge, categorizing them
as distinct types rather than mere ranks. This distinction precludes
any comparison between divine and human knowledge, thus preventing
inference about God&rsquo;s mode of apprehension and knowledge from
the characteristics of human cognition. Echoing Maimonides, Albalag
employs the theory of equivocation to explicate these ideas. According
to Maimonides, terms like wisdom, power, and will are predicated of
both God and creatures equivocally (<em>Guide</em> I:56; cf.
<em>Tiqqun</em> n.23: 24; for further discussion of the theory of
equivocation in the context of the <em>Tiqqun</em>, which can also be
linked to Averroes&rsquo; emphasis on the distinction between divine
and human knowledge, see Abdalla 2025, 182&ndash;189). Such terms
possess distinct semantic content when applied to God and creatures,
sharing only nominal similarity. Furthermore, when attributed to God,
these terms offer limited informational value, constituting an
artificial language necessitated by our incapacity to comprehend and
express His true nature (Benor 1995; Stern 2013: 198&ndash;204).</p>

<p>
Albalag&rsquo;s discussion of divine knowledge critically engages with
Avicenna&rsquo;s theory of divine knowledge, as relayed by al-Ghazali
in the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, according to which &ldquo;God
knows particulars in a universal way &rdquo;
(<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 118). Avicenna&rsquo;s theory of divine
knowledge has been subject to different interpretations (Marmura 1962:
299&ndash;312; Adamson 2005: 257&ndash;278; Belo 2006: 177&ndash;199).
As understood by Albalag, it associates God with a type of knowledge
that is particular to human beings: universal knowledge. Due to the
improper similarity between God and humans that Avicenna&rsquo;s
theory of divine knowledge entails, Albalag dismisses it as
inappropriate, and scolds al-Ghazali for diffusing false doctrines
about God. In opposition to both Avicenna and al-Ghazali, Albalag
contends that divine knowledge surpasses human knowledge
qualitatively, not merely in rank, involving entirely distinct
characteristics. Unlike human knowledge, it is neither particular nor
universal, transcends time, is indivisible, absolutely actual and
independent, and exclusively grounded in a unique mode of
self-intellection inherent to God and separate intellects
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.42: 76).</p>

<p>
Given this idea of transcendence, it seems that the scope of divine
knowledge would be so limited; neither the celestial realm nor
sublunary species and individuals would be known to God. Nonetheless,
Albalag insists that God&rsquo;s knowledge is all-encompassing. To
substantiate this, he adopts Averroes&rsquo; conception of the divine
essence as a unified form encompassing the forms of all existents
(<em>Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em>: 197), explaining that by
apprehending His own essence God knows all existents, including those
within the sublunary realm (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.42: 66). While
attributing knowledge of all existents to God might seem to compromise
His perfection and transcendence, Albalag endeavors to circumvent this
implication by affirming that forms within the essence of God do not
exactly mirror the forms of sublunary entities as material objects.
Rather, they exist in the divine essence in their purest form, being
absolutely simple, indivisible, and independent of accidents.</p>

<h3 id="ProbDete">5.4 The Problem of Determinism</h3>

<p>
In the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, al-Ghazali reiterates the
deterministic implications of Avicenna&rsquo;s understanding of the
scope of God&rsquo;s knowledge as containing future events. According
to al-Ghazali, all possible beings are necessitated by their causes;
when a cause exists, its effect necessarily follows. This necessary
cause-effect relationship entails the predictability of future events.
In particular, since God possesses complete knowledge of the patterns
of causes operating in the world and their hierarchy, all future
events are foreknown to Him (<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 118; cf.
Avicenna <em>al-Naj&#257;t</em>: 2: 103&ndash;105)</p>

<p>
In Albalag&rsquo;s opinion, this deterministic implication stems from
a focus on a narrow scope of cause-effect relationship, which he
challenges by delineating distinct patterns of causal operations. As
he explains, possible things are actualized by either material or
efficient causes, or both. Efficient causes are either volitional or
natural. The efficacy of volitional causes &ldquo;hinges solely on the
power of the chooser&rdquo;, meaning that their effects are neither
necessary nor predictable. Effects produced by natural causes are
necessary only when the natural causes are necessary, that is, when
they maintain a fixed order and cannot be hindered by other accidental
or voluntary causes. An example of this is a solar eclipse.
Foreknowledge of this and similar events is correspondingly necessary
with respect to the knower. In contrast, some natural causes, despite
having an order, can be impeded by voluntary or accidental causes. In
these cases, the effects are not necessary, and thus it is not
possible to make predictions about their occurrence with certainty.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I maintain that for any possible thing, if all its proximate an remote
causes succeed each other essentially and maintain order in their
actions, and no hindrance can prevent any of them, then it is to be
judged the same as a necessary thing with respect to knower. However,
regarding other possible things one cannot know with certain knowledge
the fact or the time of their occurrence before their occurrence.
(trans. Manekin 2007: 141)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Albalag is aware that this note entails a denial of God&rsquo;s
knowledge of every future event. For this reason, he clarifies that
his intention is not to propose that God is ignorant of future events,
for, indeed, he thinks that God knows them, but in a manner that is
different from human knowledge.</p>

<p>
Overall, Albalag is critical of al-Ghazali&rsquo;s account of
God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, and although he appreciates the easy style
with which al-Ghazali articulates the subject, which makes it
accessible to those who are not well-trained in philosophy, he
eventually condemns its religious implications, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When you examine al-Ghazali&rsquo;s statements carefully you will find
that they entail the annulment of man&rsquo;s choice and the
conclusion that his actions are compelled, as well as the annulment of
the nature of the possible altogether. These opinions not only
constitute repudiation of philosophy but also heresy with respect the
Torah. (trans. Manekin 2007: 142)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="Cosm">6. Cosmology</h2>

<p>
In discussing the fundamental traits of the Necessary Existent,
al-Ghazali considers the implications of Its absolute simplicity to
the conception of the universe. Al-Ghazali explains, following
Avicenna, that from what is one and simple (i.e., the Necessary
Existent) only one thing proceeds (<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 157;
cf. <em>al-Shif&#257;&#702;</em> [Metaphysics]: 326&ndash;334).
Underlying this viewpoint is a conception of the relationship between
cause and effect as one of correspondence, which entails the
consistency of an action with the essential nature of its cause (Kogan
1984: 249). Accordingly, a simple cause has one act and produces only
a single effect. In keeping with this conception, and considering the
absolute simplicity of the First Principle, al-Ghazali describes a
cosmological scheme in terms of emanation, where the First Principle
causes multiplicity of effects <em>not</em> directly, but through a
series of emanative intermediary causes proceeding from one another.
The First Principle produces only one entity, the first intellect, by
thinking Itself. In turn, the first intellect produces the second
intellect and the first celestial sphere (<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>:
157). This multiplicity stems from the conceptual multiplicity of the
first emanated intellect, for in addition to thinking its Principle,
it thinks itself insofar as it is possible and insofar as it is
necessary by virtue of the First Principle. The emanation continues in
a descending manner, ending with the Active Intellect, the intellect
of the sphere of the moon, the immediate source of the forms of
sublunary existents.</p>

<p>
Convinced that the scheme of emanation is an unsatisfactory deviation
from Aristotle, Albalag devotes an extensive discussion to elucidating
its inconsistency and to alternatively establishing what he considers
the correct Aristotelian scheme. Unlike the scheme of emanation, this
scheme posits that simplicity does not restrict the causal domain of
God to singularity and that God effectively remains the cause of the
universe&rsquo;s manifold existents. As Albalag asserts, from the One,
a multiplicity of existents come to be (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.96:
 69).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 The explanation of this notion of divine causation is carried out
through outlining a hierarchical cosmological scheme of separate
intellects and celestial spheres in which each separate intellect
relates to the corresponding sphere as a cause of motion, while the
First Principle/Intellect relates to all separate intellects as a
formal
 cause.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Two theories underlie this cosmological scheme: </p>

<ol type="1">

<li>the theory of divine knowledge, which, as illustrated formerly,
maintains that the First Intellect apprehends the forms of all
existents by thinking Its essence, and </li>

<li> the Aristotelian theory of cognitive identity, according to which
the knowing subject, the known object and thinking are identical in
actual thinking (for further details about this theory see Black
1999). </li>
</ol>

<p>
As understood by Albalag, separate intellects are intellects <em>in
actu</em> whose substantiation <em>is</em> the very act of thinking.
Without knowledge, the essence of the separate intellect would be
nullified. Thus, separate intellects, just like the First Intellect,
possess actual knowledge of the forms of all existents. In actual
thinking, the knower, the known, and knowledge are identical
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.42: 65), the relationship of identity being
particularly formal as Aristotle&rsquo;s dictum of cognitive identity
establishes (<em>De Anima</em> 3.8 431b21). This means that in
separate intellects &ldquo;essence/form&rdquo;, the known object, and
thinking are the same. The First Intellect is said to be &ldquo;the
formal cause&rdquo; of the separate intellects on the grounds that It
provides them with &ldquo;their forms&rdquo;, i.e., the intelligible
forms which they apprehend and by means of which they are what they
are, intellects <em>in actu</em> (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.69:
 98).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This cosmological account, however, presents a challenge for
explaining how separate intellects are differentiated. After all,
separate intellects share the feature of immateriality, which
precludes their openness to differentiation. In the
Avicennian-cosmological scheme, each intellect is differentiated by
its causal relation to the effect emanating from it (Wolfson 1958 :
244). Given his rejection of the emanation scheme, Albalag cannot
speak of a distinction among the separate intellects in terms of
respective causal relations to emanated effects. Alternatively, he
follows Averroes in positing ontological hierarchy as the
differentiating factor (<em>Tah&#257;fut al-Tah&#257;fut</em>, fifth
discussion: 173). While each separate intellect derives its knowledge
directly from the First Intellect, each stands in a different
hierarchical relation to the First Intellect, the ranking of each
intellect being in accordance with the extent of its mode of
apprehension&rsquo;s simplicity; the simpler the mode of apprehension
the closer the intellect in rank to the First Intellect. Overlap
between these modes is not possible, which is why the separate
intellects remain differentiated.</p>

<p>
Beyond this cosmological account, Albalag indicates that multiplicity
in the sublunary realm also comes forth from the deity; the First is
said to be the cause of multiplicity inasmuch as It is the ultimate
cause of the cosmic unity. Were it not for the unifying force that
holds the parts together, the universe as a totality and its
parts&mdash;each of which comes to be by virtue of a unifying force
that conjoins its constituent parts like matter and form and the
elements&mdash;would not exist (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.69: 97; cf. Averroes
<em>Tah&#257;fut al-Tah&#257;fut</em>, third discussion: 108).</p>

<h2 id="CeleMoti">7. Celestial Motion</h2>

<p>
According to Albalag, the Avicennian-cosmological scheme ascribes
celestial motion to two principles: </p>

<ol type="1">

<li> the internal souls of the spheres, and </li>

<li> the separate intellects corresponding to the spheres. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Whereas celestial souls function as the efficient causes of motion,
the separate movers, insofar as they represent objects of love and
desire, function as the final causes of motion. As Albalag explains,
both principles contribute to the production of celestial motion, but
its perpetual continuation is particularly ascribed to the separate
intellect. Celestial souls are corporeal and finite, which is why they
cannot carry on the spheres&rsquo; perpetual activities. The
perpetuation of celestial motion is made possible by the incorruptible
separate intellects, of which the mover of the outermost spheres is
the highest in rank (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.64:91; cf. Avicenna
<em>Shif&#257;&#702;</em> [Metaphysics]: 308; cf.
<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>: 149).</p>

<p>
As with many of Avicenna&rsquo;s theories, Albalag raises a number of
objections to this account of celestial motion. Firstly, he rejects
the idea of complementary efficient-final causation because it
absurdly implies that a final cause can continue the activity of a
perished efficient cause. Secondly, Albalag rejects the theory of the
spheres&rsquo; animation by souls (For background on this theory see
Wolfson 1962: 65&ndash; 93; Freudenthal 2002: 111&ndash;137). His
argument against that theory proceeds from the eternity premise as
follows. Any force inherent in a body is finite, and thus cannot
infinitely move the body in which it resides. However, since
demonstration proves that celestial motion is eternal, such that it
has no beginning or end, it follows that it cannot be attributed to
forces inherent in celestial bodies. Possessing internal souls would
thus be superfluous for celestial bodies, since such souls would play
no essential role in perpetuating their motion. Since Nature does
nothing in vain (cf. Aristotle <em>Politics</em>
1252b30&ndash;1253a1), the assumption that celestial spheres possess
internal forces, souls, must be rejected (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.61: 87);
cf. <em>Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em>: 178). Although the basic
lines of this argument are derived from Averroes, Albalag seems to
adopt a firmer position than Averroes in denying that the spheres are
animated by souls. While Averroes rejects Avicenna&rsquo;s twofold
account of celestial motion and argues in some of his works
(especially <em>De Substantia Orbis</em>: 71; cf. <em>Ibn
Rushd&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em>: 164) that celestial motion could
hardly be dependent on finite forces inherent in celestial bodies, he
uses the term soul interchangeably with form as he refers to the
principles of motion in celestial spheres: the immaterial separate
intellects. Furthermore, other works incorporate indications that
celestial spheres are ensouled (e.g., <em>Tah&#257;fut
al-Tah&#257;fut</em>, fourth discussion). These variations have given
rise to different interpretations of Averroes&rsquo; celestial physics
in modern scholarship (see Donati 2015; Kogan 1984:
190&ndash;201).</p>

<p>
As for Albalag, his account of celestial motion consistently
attributes celestial motion to the efficient, formal, and final
causation of separate intellects. Relying on Averroes while crediting
Aristotle, Albalag argues that these modes of causation are unified in
the divine realm (cf. Averroes <em>Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em>:
149). While separate intellects are themselves invariable, they
produce motion in the spheres in three different manners
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.64: 92).</p>

<h2 id="RelaBetwReliPhil">8. The Relationship Between Religion and Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Albalag has acquired attention in modern scholarship mostly due to his
view of the relationship between religion and philosophy, which
presents a unique acknowledgement of the presence of instances of
tension between philosophy and Scripture. Thus, his name is usually
associated with the doctrine of the &ldquo;double truth&rdquo;, which
maintains that the truth of prophecy and the truth of philosophy may
contradict each other while at the same time remaining simultaneously
true (Sirat 1985: 238; Zinberg 1973: 107]; Vajda 1960: 264&ndash;265).
The origin of this doctrine had long been attributed to Averroes and
Latin Averroists until recent studies challenged this attribution.
Some scholars have argued that the double truth doctrine never existed
as an actual dogma (Dales 1984). Similarly, some scholars question
associating the double truth doctrine with Albalag, particularly as a
genuine dogma rather than a rhetorical device (Guttmann 1966:
227&ndash;229; Abdalla 2022; Sadik 2024:204), and Elijah Delmedigo,
another Jewish Averroist whose treatment of the question under
discussion involves elements that can be understood in light of the
double truth doctrine (for Delmedigo, see Fraenkel 2013).</p>

<p>
Discussion of the question of the relationship between religion and
philosophy in the <em>Tiqqun</em> is complex and spans a number of
contexts. On the one hand, Albalag states in the preface to the
<em>Tiqqun</em> that there is no essential distinction between
philosophy and the Torah, except that the former, addressing the
select few, conveys the truth in a demonstrative manner, while the
latter, addressing the multitude, conveys the truth in a figurative
language that suits their limited comprehension. This aligns with the
view of religion as an imitation of philosophy, which was founded by
al-Farabi and adopted by many Muslim and Jewish philosophers, most
significantly Averroes and arguably Maimonides (see al-Farabi <em>The
Book of Letters</em>: 19&ndash;26; Maimonides <em>Guide</em>: preface;
Averroes <em>Decisive Treatise</em>: 1&ndash;3, 7&ndash;10). Both
Averroes and Maimonides maintain that religion and philosophy are
compatible. Additionally, given this compatibility, they assign to
philosophy a crucial role in arriving at the true, inner meaning of
Scripture, particularity by suitably employing it in figurative
interpretations of Scripture (Maimonides <em>Guide</em>: preface;
Averroes <em>Decisive Treatise</em>: 1&ndash;3, 7&ndash;10).
Furthermore, Averroes advances a religious epistemology, proceeding
from the assumption that &ldquo;truth does not oppose truth; rather,
it agrees with and bears witness to it&rdquo; (<em>Decisive</em>: 9).
In light of this assumption, contradictions between
<em>al-Shari&#703;ah</em> (Religious Law) and philosophy are viewed as
mere seeming, rather than essential, contradictions that result from
the literary form of Scripture&mdash; which involves similes,
metaphors, and stories. Since <em>al-Shari&#703;ah</em> cares for all
people, &ldquo;the red and black&rdquo;, it conveys the truth in
distinct methods in accordance with the types of assent for which
people of different intellectual capacities are fit (<em>ibid</em>,
8). Only those who are adept in science (<em>al-rasikhuna fi
al-&#703;ilm</em>) can have access to the internal meaning of
Scripture, which is designed according to the truth as it is, thereby
attaining certain, demonstrative, assent to Scripture. Drawing on
Averroes&rsquo; religious epistemology, post-Maimonidean philosophers,
continuing Maimonides&rsquo; philosophical-theological
 enterprise,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 undertook to interpret Judaism as &ldquo;a philosophical
religion&rdquo; by giving principles of Judaism that appeared to them
to be in conflict with philosophy naturalistic interpretations (for
the concept of philosophical religion see Fraenkel 2012: 5). In a
similar vein, Albalag engages in allegorical interpretations of some
elements of the Account of the Beginning, stating that &ldquo;it is
possible to extract the philosophical doctrine of eternal generation
from the Torah&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30, 33). </p>

<p>
On the other hand, Albalag reveals ambivalence about the feasibility
of the philosophical approach to religion, as he points to the
difficulty of accessing the true meaning of Scripture. Importantly,
prophetic secrets enclosed in Scripture remain exclusive to the
understanding of the prophet. Even the ablest philosopher can hardly
understand them or have access to the &ldquo;intention&rdquo; of the
prophet. Accordingly, when a philosopher assigns a philosophical
meaning to a verse he may just be deviating from its actual, concealed
meaning. </p>

<p>
Furthermore, the philosophical approach to religion poses implications
for both religion and philosophy to which Albalag points through his
critique and description of Maimonides as one of the
&ldquo;hasty&rdquo; people who did harm to both faith and wisdom
(<em>Tiqqun</em> n.1: 5; <em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 44). From
Albalag&rsquo;s perspective, the attempts of Maimonides and his
followers to rationally support religious doctrines drove them to act
&ldquo;with ignorance&rdquo;: </p>

<ol type="1">

<li> They denied demonstrative philosophical doctrines, advocating,
instead, weak speculative arguments, and </li>

<li> They ascribed meanings to Scripture in terms of these arguments
and based on their own understanding of Scripture. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Two considerations underlie Albalag&rsquo;s critique. The first is
that Maimonides and those who followed in his footsteps were pushed to
compromise philosophy to satisfy their theological commitments. The
second is that philosophers confidently interpreted Scripture
allegorically on the assumption that they correctly understood the
internal meaning of Scripture, whereas, in fact, the true intention of
the prophet cannot be accessible. Given these implications, Albalag
offers what may be characterized as a restrictive scheme of scriptural
interpretation in terms of philosophy (for a discussion of
Albalag&rsquo;s approach to Scripture in light of skeptical
considerations, see Lemler 2019). This scheme specifies demonstration
as the proper method for attaining the truth by natural means and
Scripture as a divine source of the truth. Scripture contains two
layers of secrets: philosophical and prophetic. A philosopher may have
the ability to arrive at the former layer by engaging in allegorical
interpretation after having obtained true knowledge by natural means,
i.e. through demonstration: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for one who seeks the truth, it is not proper [for him] to seek its
premises from what he apprehends from Scripture by his own effort
without primarily [engaging in] demonstrative reasoning. Rather, he
has to learn the truth first through demonstration and thereafter seek
support from Scripture. (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 37; cf. Averroes
<em>Decisive Treatise</em>: 7) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a Scriptural doctrine conflicts with a demonstrative conclusion,
one is led to assuming the presence of a deeper layer of secrets,
prophetic secrets to which only a prophet has access. In this
occasion, it is recommended that one accepts the former based on
simple faith, while at the same time maintaining adherence to the
latter based on demonstration. Both doctrines remain
&ldquo;true&rdquo; (<em>&#702;emet</em>) for the
philosopher-believer.</p>

<p>
These claims have led to the ascription of the double truth doctrine
to Albalag in modern scholarship. It should be noted, however, that
the double truth is meagerly applied throughout <em>Tiqqun</em>; only
within the context of the tension between religion and philosophy
about the origin of the world. Towards the end of his discussion of
this issue Albalag states that he accepts as &ldquo;true&rdquo; both
the philosophical doctrine of eternal generation and the biblical
doctrine of temporal creation, the former based on
&ldquo;nature&rdquo; and by means of &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; and
the latter based on &ldquo; prophetic authority and by way of
miracle&rdquo; (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 52). This peculiar way of
treating the question of the relationship between religion and
philosophy separates Albalag, at least partially, from the tradition
of Jewish Averroism in which religion and philosophy are held to be
different representations of the same truth. </p>

<h2 id="TheoProp">9. Theory of Prophecy</h2>

<p>
Underlying the double truth doctrine is a unique theory of prophecy.
Departing from the widely adopted conception of prophecy in medieval
Jewish and Islamic philosophy, which views prophets as accomplished
philosophers, Albalag associates prophets with the realm of separate
intellects. According to Albalag, prophets are extraordinary
individuals endowed with a special mode of apprehension that grants
them access to knowledge distinct from philosophical knowledge in both
content and type. Prophets not only arrive at answers to questions
that lie beyond the capacity of human reason, but they also grasp the
truth in a transcendent manner, independently of physical tools and
the cognitive processes required for rational knowledge (Guttmann
1945: 86; &#7778;adik 2015; Abdalla 2022: 677).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Their [the philosopher&rsquo;s and prophet&rsquo;s] modes of
apprehension are distinct. In fact, they are opposite [one another]:
[the philosopher] perceives the intelligible through sensory objects,
while the latter [the prophet] perceives sensory objects through the
intelligible. (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 44 [my translation])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Albalag suggests that the prophetic mode of apprehension
parallels that of the separate intellects, which is described in the
<em>Tiqqun</em> in similar terms, as &ldquo; opposite &rdquo; to the
human intellect in that it obtains knowledge independently of physical
tools (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.11: 16; cf. n.42: 67). This distinction
entails differences in the characteristics of the perceived knowledge.
While human knowledge transitions from potentiality to actuality, is
universal and particular, pertains to time, and involves features of
multiplicity, and compositeness, divine knowledge is transcendent,
being neither particular nor universal, constantly actual,
indivisible, simple, and atemporal (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.42: 67). From
this perspective, prophetic knowledge is said to harbor qualitative
distinctions from philosophical knowledge, which is why conflict
between them arises on some occasions </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as they [the philosopher and the prophet] apprehend things in
distinct ways, their respective understandings are so distinct that it
is possible for the former to perceive from below [based on natural
means] the opposite (<em>hefekh</em>) of what the latter perceives
from above. (<em>Tiqqun</em> n.30: 45 [my translation])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrasting the realms of prophecy and philosophy, Albalag&rsquo;s
theory of prophecy diverges from the prevailing view in his
intellectual milieu, which saw prophets as accomplished philosophers,
distinguished from philosophers only by their possession of a strong
imaginative faculty. This faculty enabled prophets, unlike
philosophers, to carry out the crucial political role of establishing
laws conducive to the welfare of society and reformulate theoretical
knowledge in a way that the general public could easily understand.
Whatever theoretical knowledge a prophet attains through emanation
from the Active Intellect&mdash;the intellect of the sphere of the
moon to which philosophers ascribed epistemological and ontological
roles in the sublunary realm&mdash;aligns with philosophical
knowledge, with the difference being particularly quantitative (Macy
1986; Rahman 1958). Even the Avicennian theory of prophecy, which
links the prophetic mind to the divine realm, does not attribute any
qualitative superiority to prophetic knowledge over philosophical
knowledge. Instead, prophets are thought to apprehend the principles
of all existents, the middle term of every syllogism and intelligible
forms instantaneously and effortlessly through divine intuition
(<em>&#7717;ads</em>). (Rahman, 1958: 32; Marmura 1963: 49&ndash;51;
Morris 1992: 84). In other words, in this Avicennian view of prophecy,
no room is left for contradiction between prophetic and philosophical
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="PoliThou">10. Political Thought</h2>

<p>
In the context of medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, political
thought emerged from exploring the connection between social good and
human happiness on one hand, and philosophy and religion on the other.
In the final section of the Metaphysics of the
<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>, al-Ghazali relates the
philosophers&rsquo; standpoint on the relationship between social
welfare and religion. Proceeding from the Aristotelian dictum that
&ldquo;man is political by nature&rdquo; (Aristotle <em>Politics</em>
1252b30&ndash;1253a1), the philosophers explain that it is necessary
for people to live in societies in order to satisfy their basic needs.
Through social interactions and cooperation, they can ultimately
attain the highest good. However, society can be conducive to these
goals only when it is justly governed. Such a state of justice is tied
to the existence of a lawgiver who enacts laws and promotes doctrines
that ensure social and spiritual well-being.</p>

<p>
Albalag begins the <em>Tiqqun</em> with the political theme with which
al-Ghazali concludes the <em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id</em>. In the preface
to the <em>Tiqqun</em>, Albalag emphasizes the political nature of
human beings and the essential role of society in realizing the
well-being of individuals. Nonetheless, Albalag explains that society
could be led to a different fatal direction if it contained diverse
beliefs and practices, given that lack of unity might result in
constant tension and warfare, ultimately threatening human existence.
Therefore, a lawgiver is needed to foster social harmony by uniting
people through shared beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>
Albalag accommodates the Torah into this political theme, assigning it
a crucial role in establishing social and political order and
maintaining the divinely ordained perpetual existence of the human
species. This outlook aligns with the Medieval Aristotelian view on
the socio-political function of divine Law. Maimonides, for instances,
considers the Torah a key factor in the establishment and maintenance
of social well-being. However, Albalag departs from Maimonides, as
well as prominent Muslim philosophers such and Averroes, by confining
the Torah&rsquo;s purpose to this socio-political function. These
philosophers, in contrast, define divine Law by its dual goals,
explaining that, unlike man-made laws, which care only for the welfare
of society, divine Law cares for both the welfare of society and
welfare of the soul (Fraenkel 2012: 175; Z. Harvey 1980:
199&ndash;200). In Maimonides&rsquo; understanding, the Torah does not
exclusively focus on the practical domain, but it is also concerned
with theoretical virtues. Reflecting this understanding, he interprets
the commandment to &ldquo;love the Lord&rdquo; (Deuteronomy
6:4&ndash;5) as an injunction for the true worship of God:
intellectual worship. The Torah, accordingly, calls upon people to
seek knowledge of all existents by virtue of which man attains
intellectual perfection, truly worshiping God (<em>Eight
Chapters</em>: 78; cf. <em>Guide</em> III:53).</p>

<p>
In one context, Albalag relates religious commandments to the
injunction of exerting oneself to the true worship of God, which
involves a fundamental intellectual aspect (Sadik 2022: 362).
Nonetheless, this briefly mentioned perspective is overshadowed by a
clear distinction drawn between philosophy and the Torah in the
preface to the Tiqqun in terms of their respective goals: philosophy
aims for the happiness of the select few, which is intellectual in
nature, while the Torah aims for the happiness of the multitude,
focusing exclusively on civic well-being. In the same context, Albalag
introduces four foundational principles of the Torah. </p>

<ol type="1">

<li> reward and punishment, </li>

<li> the survival of the soul after death, </li>

<li> the existence of a deity that rewards and punishes, and </li>

<li> the existence of divine providence that watches over human
beings, each according to his deeds.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is evident that these principles fall under the category of those
necessary for social well-being (Touati 1962: 44&ndash;47; Schweid
2008: 320&ndash;321; Guttmann 1945: 90&ndash;91). While Albalag
acknowledges that these principles are also shared by philosophy and
other laws, his philosophical analysis reveals a divergence between
philosophy&rsquo;s approach and the Torah&rsquo;s presentation of
these and other doctrines for societal purposes. Furthermore, the
Torah&rsquo;s profound commitment to the multitude&rsquo;s happiness
is made all the more evident by highlighting its strategic use of
concealment and revelation. As Albalag explains, only doctrines
conducive to social well-being are revealed, either directedly or
indirectly, by the Torah. Doctrines that might conflict with this aim
or potentially harm society are either concealed or omitted. </p>

<h2 id="Conc">11. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
<em>Sefer Tiqqun ha de&#703;ot</em> represents a significant
development in both Jewish thought and philosophy. During a period
when post-Maimonidean philosophers sought to advance Maimonides&rsquo;
philosophical-theological enterprise, as they interpreted it, Albalag
advocated the double truth doctrine, which stands at odds with the
principles and objectives of the Maimonidean enterprise. In practice,
however, this doctrine is applied in a remarkably limited scope, while
the superiority of philosophy as a source of true knowledge and
certainty is highlighted throughout the <em>Tiqqun</em>. Unlike the
religious domain, where truth is qualified by degrees and is
ultimately accessible by prophets and is subject to human
interpretations, philosophical truth is seen as absolute. It can be
obtained through demonstrative reasoning and learned from Aristotelian
sciences. This understanding of philosophical truth motivated Albalag
to critically examine philosophical discourse, aiming to eliminate
errors and restore what he perceived as correct Aristotelianism, as
understood through the lens of Averroes, the Commentator. The outcome
is a philosophical treatise that, overall, marks a keen attempt to
move away from major Neo-Platonic trends that had influenced the
Avicennian-Farabian interpretation of Aristotle.</p>
