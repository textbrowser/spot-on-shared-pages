<h1>Plutarch</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Sep 7, 2010; substantive revision Thu Dec 5, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Plutarch of Chaeronea in Boeotia (<em>ca</em>. 45&ndash;120 CE) was a
Platonist philosopher, best known to the general public as author of
his &ldquo;Parallel Lives&rdquo; of paired Greek and Roman statesmen
and military leaders. He was a voluminous writer, author also of a
collection of &ldquo;Moralia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ethical Essays,&rdquo;
mostly in dialogue format, many of them devoted to philosophical
topics, but not at all limited to ethics.</p>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s significance as a philosopher, on which this article
concentrates, lies in his attempt to do justice to Plato&rsquo;s work
as a whole, and to reconstruct a coherent and credible philosophical
system out of it, as Antiochus (1st c. BCE) tried to do and as
Plotinus will also do later (204&ndash;270 CE). Two moves are crucial
in this regard. First, Plutarch, unlike Antiochus, respects both the
skeptical/aporetic element in Plato (as marked by the tentativeness
with which Socrates and the other main speakers in his dialogues
regularly advance their views) but also the views apparently endorsed
by the main speakers of the dialogues, which were widely regarded as
Plato&rsquo;s own doctrines (e.g. Diogenes Laertius 3.51&ndash;2).
Second, Plutarch, again unlike Antiochus but like Pythagorean
Platonists, focuses primarily and quite strongly on the
<em>Timaeus</em> for his understanding of Plato&rsquo;s
&ldquo;doctrines,&rdquo; and his interpretation of this dialogue
shapes his understanding of the entirety of Plato&rsquo;s thought.
Plutarch maintains what one may call literal interpretation of the
<em>Timaeus</em>, according to which the world has come about in time
from two principles, the divine craftsman and the &ldquo;Indefinite
Dyad&rdquo;, a Pythagorean pair of principles espoused already by
Speusippus. While the divine craftsman accounts for the coming into
being of order, of <em>kosmos</em>, and for the identity of all
objects in the world, the Dyad accounts for disorder, which allegedly
prevailed before the world-creation.</p>

<p>
This metaphysical or principle dualism is further strengthened by the
assumption of two mediating entities through which the two principles,
God and the Dyad, operate; the Indefinite Dyad operates through a
non-rational cosmic soul, while God through a rational one. This is
the same soul, which becomes rational when God imparts reason from
himself to it. As a result of God&rsquo;s imparting reason to the
world soul, matter ceases to move in a disorderly manner, being
brought into order through the imposition of Forms on it. The
postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic world soul, inspired mainly
by <em>Laws</em> X (but absent from the <em>Timaeus</em>), allows
Plutarch to dissolve an apparent contradiction in Plato&rsquo;s works
that the soul is both uncreated (<em>Phaedrus</em> 245c&ndash;246a)
and created (<em>Timaeus</em> 34b&ndash;36d). For in his view the soul
of the sensible world, the world soul, is created only in the sense
that God, the demiurge of the <em>Timaeus</em>, makes it rational. The
postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul also allows Plutarch to
account for the existence of badness in the world, because in his view
residual irrationality abides in the world soul even when it becomes
rational, which is accounted for by the fact that the world soul is
originally and essentially non-rational, in the sense that its
movement is such, i.e. disorderly, and reason is an element external
to it, coming from the divine craftsman.</p>

<p>
This dualism (non-rational-disorderly-bad vs. rational-orderly-good)
pervades also the sensible or physical world, since the human soul,
being derivative from the world soul, exhibits a similar structure
with it and has a rational and a non-rational aspect too, as the
<em>Republic</em> and the <em>Timaeus</em> suggest. In this spirit,
Plutarch distinguishes both in the world and in human beings three
aspects, body, soul, and intellect. The soul&rsquo;s concern with the
body gives rise to the non-rational aspect, which amounts to disorder,
vice, or even badness, while the co-operation between soul and
intellect promotes rationality, that is, order, virtue, benevolence.
In an attempt to accommodate the diverse strands of ethical thought in
Plato (e.g. in the <em>Gorgias</em>, <em>Protagoras</em>,
<em>Republic</em>, <em>Phaedo</em>, <em>Theaetetus</em>,
<em>Timaeus</em>), Plutarch comes close to distinguish different
levels of ethical life, which we could term political or civic and
theoretical respectively, depending on whether virtue pertains to the
soul as an organizing principle for one&rsquo;s daily life within a
society, or to the human intellect as one&rsquo;s guide to knowledge,
especially knowledge of the Forms and of the intelligible realm, more
generally.</p>

<h2><a name="LifWor">1. Life and works</a></h2>

<p>
Plutarch was born in Chaeronea, a city of Boeotia in central Greece
between 45 and 47 CE. This date is inferred from Plutarch&rsquo;s own
testimony (<em>On the E at Delphi</em> 385B), according to which he
began studying at Athens with a Platonist philosopher named Ammonius
(see Dillon 1977, 189&ndash;192, Donini 1986b), when Nero was in
Greece (66/67 CE). (This assumes that he was not more than twenty
years old at the time.) We know little about Plutarch&rsquo;s teacher,
Ammonius and his school, that is, also of Plutarch&rsquo;s
institutional affiliation. The evidence of <em>On the E at Delphi</em>
387F and <em>On the Obsolescence of Oracles</em> 431A, according to
which Plutarch was frequenting a school called &ldquo;Academy&rdquo;,
has been much debated (see e.g. Whittaker 1969, Donini 1986a,
209&ndash;212, 1986b, 108&ndash;119, Opsomer 1999, 21&ndash;25,
129&ndash;131, Opsomer 2009, 148). Presumably Ammonius was teaching
where Plato&rsquo;s Academy used to be or he called his school so. The
main evidence about Ammonius&rsquo; philosophical views is his speech
as a character in <em>On the E at Delphi</em> (391E&ndash;394C), on
God, being, generation and corruption as well as his contributions to
the discussion in <em>On the Obsolescence of Oracles</em>
(410F&ndash;414C) regarding divine justice and providence (Dillon
1977, 190&ndash;192, Opsomer 2009, 142&ndash;179). This evidence can
be reasonably considered indicative of Ammonius&rsquo; engagement with
metaphysics (including theology and religious matters), which must
have stimulated Plutarch&rsquo;s own interest in such questions. In
other places of Plutarch&rsquo;s work, like in <em>Table Talks</em>
(<em>Quaestiones Convivales)</em>, Ammonius is only one of the
discussants and not much can be inferred about his views (see Lanza
2022). Given the evidence we have about Ammonius, he must have
combined Pythagorean elements with an aporetic or zetetic
interpretation of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy (see Opsomer 2009, 169,
against Whittaker 1969).</p>

<p>
Plutarch must have stayed in Athens not only during his studies with
Ammonius but considerably longer, so as to become an Athenian citizen
(<em>Quaest. Conv.</em> 628A). According to this testimony, he
travelled extensively, including Rome (<em>Demetrius</em> 2) and
Alexandria (<em>Quaest. Conv.</em> 678A; see Ziegler 1951,
653&ndash;657, Russell 1973, 7&ndash;8). However, Plutarch spent most
of his life in his native city, Chaeronea, and in nearby Delphi. There
must have been two reasons for this; first, Plutarch&rsquo;s strong
ties with his family, which apparently was wealthy enough to support
his studies and travels (Russell 1973, 3&ndash;5, Roskam 2021,
3&ndash;17), and, second, his own interest in the religious activity
of Delphi. The latter is testified to by the fact that Plutarch served
in various positions in Delphi, including that of the priest of Apollo
(<em>Quaest. Conv.</em> 700E, <em>An seni</em> 792F), and also by his
several works concerning Delphi and the local sacred rituals (<em>On
the E at Delphi, On Oracles at Delphi, On the Obsolescence of
Oracles</em>; see Ziegler 1951, 659&ndash;662, Stadter 2005). These
works demonstrate intimate knowledge of Delphi, its religious
traditions, rites, and activities. Plutarch must have died after 119
CE, the date at which he was appointed procurator (<em>epitropos</em>)
of Achaea by Hadrian (Eusebius&rsquo; <em>Chronicle</em> in Syncellus
426.22&ndash;23 Mosshamer<em>)</em>.</p>

<p>
Plutarch was a prolific writer. The so-called Lamprias catalogue, an
ancient library catalogue (preserved mutilated), supposedly compiled
by Plutarch&rsquo;s son Lamprias, lists 227 works, several of them no
longer extant (Russell 1973, 18&ndash;19). Plutarch&rsquo;s works
divide into philosophical and historical-biographical. The latter, the
so-called <em>Lives</em> (<em>Bioi</em>) of distinguished Greek and
Roman men examined in pairs, demonstrate Plutarch&rsquo;s historical
and rhetorical abilities, also showing his interest in character
formation and in politics (Russell 1973, 100&ndash;116).
Plutarch&rsquo;s philosophical works, many of them dialogues (set in
Delphi or Chaeronea), cover half of his literary output. In modern
times they have been published under the collective term
<em>Moralia</em>, a term first given to a collection of eleven ethical
works preserved in a 14<sup>th</sup> century manuscript (Parisinus
Graecus 1672). When the collection was augmented by many other
writings preserved in other manuscripts on topics ranging from
psychology, to natural philosophy, theology, logic, and philosophy of
art, the name was retained, with the misleading implication that
Plutarch&rsquo;s philosophical oeuvre is essentially or primarily
ethical.</p>

<p>
Plutarch is also a skilled polemicist. Among Plutarch&rsquo;s works,
several are written against the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies (see
Kechagia 2011, 135&ndash;178, Dillon&ndash;Zadorojnyi 2023). Against
the Stoics are mainly the works <em>On Self&ndash;contradictions of
the Stoics</em> (<em>De stoicorum repugnantiis</em>), <em>On the
Common Notions against the Stoics</em> (<em>De communibus
notitiis</em>), <em>On the Cleverness of Animals</em> (<em>De
sollertia animalium</em>), and <em>On Moral Virtue</em> (<em>De
virtute morali</em>). Plutarch&rsquo;s main works against the
Epicureans are: <em>That One Cannot Live Happily Following
Epicurus</em> (<em>Non posse suaviter vivere secundum Epicurum</em>),
<em>Against Colotes</em> (<em>Adversus Colotem</em>), <em>Is
&lsquo;Live Unnoticed&rsquo; Well Said?</em> (<em>An recte dictum sit
latenter esse vivendum</em>). All these works are marked by the use of
a distinct polemical tone against assumed adversaries, and of
recognizable polemical strategies, such as that of showing them
self-contradicting (Boys-Stones 1997a). They are often captious and in
many instances betray a less than fair engagement with the views being
opposed (see Warren 2011, 290&ndash;293 but also Kechagia 2011,
135&ndash;294 for a vindication of Plutarch&rsquo;s polemics in
<em>Against Colotes</em>).</p>

<p>
It is worth considering why Plutarch engaged in writing so many
polemical works against the two main Hellenistic schools of
philosophy. One reason for Plutarch&rsquo;s preoccupation must be that
the early Stoics and Epicureans both strongly criticized Plato. The
Epicurean Colotes, for instance, Plutarch&rsquo;s target in the
<em>Against Colotes</em>, was critical of Plato&rsquo;s dialogues in
his <em>Against Plato&rsquo;s Lysis</em> and <em>Against Plato&rsquo;s
Euthydemus</em> (meager fragments of which are preserved in
Herculaneum papyri <em>PHerc</em>. 208, <em>PHerc</em>. 1032), while
he also criticized the <em>Republic</em>&rsquo;s myth of Er and the
implied view of an immortal human soul (Proclus, <em>In Rempubl.</em>
2.109.11&ndash;12, 111.6&ndash;17; see Kechagia 2011, 53&ndash;132).
Another reason for Plutarch&rsquo;s engagement was the fact that both
Epicureans and Stoics drew extensively for their own purposes on Plato
without acknowledging it and despite their criticism of Plato. This
holds true especially for the Stoics (see Babut 1969a). They were
inspired by the <em>Timaeus</em>, for instance, in their adoption of
two principles, God and matter, but their God, unlike that of Plato,
is immanent in the physical world and bodily, and he alone, without
the Forms, suffices for the shaping of matter. The Stoics were
probably guided to their view that only bodies exist also by passages
in the <em>Sophist</em> (246a&ndash;247c) and in the <em>Timaeus</em>
(31b&ndash;32c, 49d&ndash;e, 53b&ndash;c). For Plutarch, though, this
is an utterly mistaken reading of the <em>Timaeus</em> (<em>De comm.
not.</em> 1073D&ndash;1074E). Plutarch&rsquo;s polemics were, then,
most probably motivated by his desire to advocate Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy as he understood it, against what he regarded as misguided
interpretations and criticisms on the part of Epicureans and Stoics.
This defense of Platonism was of vital importance for Platonism at
Plutarch&rsquo;s time, since both Stoicism and Epicureanism were still
thriving, mainly in virtue of their ethics. Plutarch wanted to show
that Stoic and Epicurean ethics rest on mistaken assumptions about
human nature and reality, which render their ethical doctrines useless
(see e.g. <em>De virtute morali</em> 450A&ndash;D, <em>De stoic.
rep.</em> 1041E&ndash;1043A, <em>De comm. not.</em> 1060B&ndash;1073D;
see below section 6). Plutarch&rsquo;s polemics was fuelled by the
view he shares with Hellenistic philosophers that the end of
philosophy is to guide us to happiness (<em>eudaimonia</em>, see e.g.
<em>De profectibus in virtute</em>); if a school&rsquo;s ethical ideal
is unrealizable or, worse, unworthy of human nature, this for Plutarch
(as for Antiochus, Cicero, <em>De finibus</em> V.13, V.89, and Cicero
himself, <em>De finibus</em> II.113&ndash;114, III.1&ndash;2) is
evidence that the entire philosophical system is a failure.</p>

<p>
Two further features of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy appear to annoy
Plutarch considerably: first, their dismissal of the
aporetic/dialectical spirit that Socrates embodies, and which Plutarch
regards as central to Plato&rsquo;s philosophy and also to his
teacher&rsquo;s Ammonius (<em>De E</em> 385C; see also below sections
2, 3), and second, the Stoic and Epicurean adoption of a corporealist
or materialist metaphysics and their rejection of the intelligible
realm (that comprises God, Forms, intellects, souls), which was
essential to Platonism. The central line permeating Plutarch&rsquo;s
relevant criticism is that Stoics and Epicureans contradict our common
notions (see e.g. <em>De comm. not.</em> 1073C&ndash;1074F) and do not
do justice to things themselves (<em>De prof. virt.</em>
75F&ndash;76A). Ironically, perhaps, Plutarch&rsquo;s polemical
writings are of great value for us today also for the many quotations
they contain from Stoics, Epicurus, and other authors whose works were
not preserved into modern times, and for his reports and paraphrases
of their views drawn from works no longer available to us. Were it not
for Plutarch, our grasp of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy would be
much less extensive than it is, and our ability to reconstruct and
appreciate their ideas much reduced.</p>

<p>
Here is an overview of Plutarch&rsquo;s works, to give a sense of his
conception of philosophy and of what in Platonist philosophy
especially he valued.</p>

<p>
Plutarch wrote relatively little in the field of &ldquo;logic&rdquo;
in the ancient sense (<em>logik&ecirc;</em>), which includes
epistemology and dialectic. This, however, does not necessarily point
to a lack of interest or knowledge on his part. Quite the opposite
must be the case. Plutarch is particularly attracted to epistemology
because he considers this as a crucial aspect of Platonist philosophy.
He seeks to defend the epistemology of Academic skeptics like
Arcesilaus and Carneades and on these grounds to advocate the unity of
the Academy against the criticisms of Antiochus of Ascalon
(1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE; see below, sections 2 and 3). The Lamprias
list of Plutarch&rsquo;s works contains one on Stoic logic (<em>Reply
to Chrysippus on the First Consequent</em>, #152) and two on
Aristotle&rsquo;s: <em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s Topics</em> in eight books
(#56) and a <em>Lecture on the Ten Categories</em> (#192), all of them
no longer extant. The latter two are indicative of a reawakening of
interest in Aristotelian logic beginning in the 1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE,
cultivated mainly by Peripatetics such as Boethus and Andronicus, but
also characterizing Platonists of Plutarch&rsquo;s era, such as
Eudorus and Nicostratus, who engaged especially with Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em>. Although the content of these Plutarchean works
remains unknown, we do have Plutarch&rsquo;s own claim that
Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrine of categories is foreshadowed in the
<em>Timaeus</em> (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1023E; cf. <em>Timaeus</em>
37b&ndash;c), which suggests that he considered Aristotelian logic a
welcome development of relevant Platonic ideas (Karamanolis 2006,
123&ndash;125). Plutarch&rsquo;s interest in the <em>Topics</em>, on
the other hand, must have been motivated by his interest in the
dialectical methodology of arguing both sides of a question
(Karamanolis 2006, 86&ndash;87; see further below, section 3), to
which the <em>Topics</em> is devoted. The question of the criterion of
truth must have been central to works such as <em>On How We Should
Judge Truth</em> (#225), <em>What is Understanding</em>? (#144),
<em>That Understanding is Impossible</em> (#146), none of which is
extant today. The lost work <em>Whether He Who Suspends Judgment on
Everything is Led to Inaction</em> (#158) must have confronted the
common accusation against skepticism voiced in its title (cf. Cicero,
<em>Academica</em> II (Lucullus) 37&ndash;39). Among Plutarch&rsquo;s
surviving works important for understanding his epistemology are the
<em>Platonic Questions</em> I and III, <em>Against Colotes</em>,
<em>On the Common Notions</em>, and <em>On the Generation of the
Soul</em> 1024F&ndash;1025A (see below, section 3).</p>

<p>
Plutarch paid special attention to &ldquo;physics&rdquo;, which in
antiquity included metaphysics, natural philosophy, psychology, and
theology. His most important surviving works in this area are those
related to the interpretation of the <em>Timaeus</em>, namely <em>On
the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus</em> (<em>De animae procreatione
in Timaeo</em>), <em>On Isis and Osiris (De Iside et
Osiride)</em>; from lost works of Plutarch relevant are the following:
<em>Where are the Forms</em>? (#67), <em>How Matter Participates in
the Forms: It Constitutes the Primary Bodies</em> (#68), <em>On the
World&rsquo;s Having Come into Beginning According to Plato</em>
(#66), <em>On Matter</em> (#185), <em>On the Fifth Substance</em>
(#44). Plutarch shows quite some interest in the explanation of
natural phenomena in several surviving works (see Meeusen 2017), most
importantly in: <em>On the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon
(De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet</em>), <em>On the Principle of
Cold (De primo frigido), On the Cleverness of Animals (De sollertia
animalium)</em>. Plutarch&rsquo;s interest in this area is apparently
motivated by the wish to develop and defend Platonist natural
philosophy and oppose the Stoics, who were dominant in this field
especially since Posidonius (1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE), and in
Plutarch&rsquo;s age with his older contemporary Seneca (<em>ca.</em>
1 BCE&ndash;65 CE), the author of <em>Naturales Quaestiones</em>.
Given the importance of God in the world&rsquo;s coming into being, he
is seriously engaged with theology, especially with questions
pertaining to the relation between God and man, such as the issue of
divination, divine justice, and divine punishment, and so on, in:
<em>On Oracles at Delphi</em> (<em>De Pythiae oraculis</em>), <em>On
the Obsolescence of Oracles</em> (<em>De defectu oraculorum</em>),
<em>On the E at Delphi</em> (<em>De E apud Delphos</em>), <em>On the
Delays of the Divine Vengeance</em> (<em>De sera numinis
vindicta</em>), and <em>On the Daemon of Socrates</em> (<em>De genio
Socratis</em>). Plutarch&rsquo;s <em>On the Generation of Soul in the
Timaeus</em> together with the ten <em>Platonic Questions</em>
illustrate well his work as a Platonic exegete (see Hershbell 1987,
Ferrari 2001).</p>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s ethical works include some of theoretical orientation
(e.g. <em>On Moral Virtue</em>, which refutes the Stoic theory of
virtue and outlines a Platonist one) and some of practical one (e.g.
<em>On Control of Anger, On Curiosity, How Could you Tell a Flatterer
from a Friend</em>), offering practical advice on how to attain virtue
and build a good character. The scholarly tendency, however, to
distinguish two altogether separate classes of ethical works
(following Ziegler 1951, 768&ndash;825) is problematic given the
considerable affinities between them; yet Plutarch does use different
styles in them, presumably targeting different audiences (Van Hoof
2010, 264&ndash;265). Particularly representative of Plutarch&rsquo;s
ethical views are the treatises <em>On Moral Virtue</em> (<em>De
virtute morali</em>), <em>On Making Progress in Virtue</em> (<em>De
profectibus in virtute</em>), <em>On the Delays in Divine
Vengeance</em> (<em>De sera numinis vindicta</em>), <em>On Control of
Anger</em> (<em>De cohibenda ira</em>), and <em>On Tranquility of
Mind</em> (<em>De tranquillitate animi</em>). Plutarch wrote also
works on aesthetics and education, which one could classify also as
works of practical orientation. Plutarch, following Plato, evaluates
poetry from the point of view of ethical education. In this category
belong the works <em>On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets</em>
(<em>De audiendis poetis</em>) and <em>On the Education of
Children</em> (<em>De liberis educandis</em>), the latter of dubious
authenticity (Ziegler 1951, 809&ndash;811; see below, section 7).</p>

<p>
Finally, Plutarch wrote a number of works on aspects and figures of
the history of philosophy, all lost today, which are indicative of the
classicism of his age, such as <em>On What Heraclitus Maintained</em>
(#205), <em>On Empedocles</em> (#43), <em>On the Cyrenaics</em>
(#188), <em>On the Difference between Pyrrhonians and Academics</em>
(#64), <em>On the Unity of the Academy Since Plato</em> (#63). The
latter two could not have been merely historical, however; the
historical perspective must rather have served to defend the point of
view of the skeptical Academy, which Plutarch advocated as doing
justice to the aporetic spirit of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy (see below,
section 2).</p>

<h2><a name="PluPla">2. Plutarch&rsquo;s Platonism</a></h2>

<p>
Plutarch lived in the wake of the revival of the dogmatic
interpretation of Plato begun by Antiochus and Eudorus in the
1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE, which in a way he continues and develops.
Plutarch, however, shows a more complex philosophical profile than
Antiochus and Eudorus, apparently through developing the version of
Academic skepticism defended by Antiochus&rsquo; contemporary Philo of
Larissa and also (slightly later) Cicero. He strives for a synthesis
of the skeptical interpretation of Plato, defended by the Academic
skeptics Arcesilaus, Carneades, and Philo, with that of
Antiochus&rsquo; dogmatic interpretation, according to which Plato
held doctrines of his own. Thus Plutarch objects to the distinction
that Antiochus suggested between Socratic and Platonic philosophy and
the corresponding division of Plato&rsquo;s dialogues into
Socratic/aporetic and Platonic/doctrinal (Cicero, <em>Academica</em>
I.15&ndash;17). For Plutarch, rather, Plato accommodates harmoniously
both an aporetic and a doctrinal element in his philosophy. According
to Plutarch, the aporetic element in Plato encourages a way of
searching for the truth without a priori commitments or even
commitment to a final view, and this practically amounts to a
dialectical inquiry, as Socrates often does in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues
(cf. <em>Plat. Q.</em> 999D&ndash;F, 1000C&ndash;E). Plutarch often
explicitly recommends an aporetic, non-commital attitude to an issue,
as Socrates and also the Academics did (<em>De sera</em> 549E&ndash;F,
<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1000C&ndash;C, <em>Adv. Col</em>. 1117D, <em>De
primo frigido</em> 955C). This aporetic spirit, however, does not rule
out the possibility of reaching certain firm conclusions, or even the
possibility of achieving secure knowledge. According to Plutarch,
Plato had reached such conclusions in his dialogues, which can be
identified as Plato&rsquo;s doctrines, and yet he still preserved the
spirit of unceasing inquiry, embedded in the dialogue form itself, by
not holding them in a way which closed off reconsideration and further
inquiry (compare <em>Plat. Q.</em> 1, 999C&ndash;E, and <em>Plat.
Q</em>. 3, 1001C&ndash;E, <em>Plat. Q</em>. 8, 1006C&ndash;D, <em>De
def. or.</em> 428C). This is why Plutarch advocates an epistemology
that integrates both the suspension of judgment and a defense of the
possibility of acquiring true knowledge (see below, section 3). One
may argue that these two aspects mark the philosophical personalities
of Socrates and Ammonius (cf. <em>Plat. Q</em>. 999 C&ndash;F, <em>De
E</em> 385C), who Plutarch presents as his teachers. Apparently
Plutarch defended the unity of the Academy, going all the way back to
Plato, which Antiochus had considered as having been disrupted with
the advent of Academic Skepticism, in lost treatises, such as <em>On
the Unity of the Academy since Plato</em>, <em>On the Difference
Between Pyrrhoneans and Academics</em> (see <em>Adv. Col.</em>
1121F&ndash;1122E, <em>Plat. Q.</em> I; with Opsomer 1998,
127&ndash;133). Plutarch actually tried to disengage the term
&lsquo;Academic&rsquo; from implying exclusive commitment to the
skeptical construal of Plato. Suspension of judgment, he thinks, is
rather an established method of philosophical research followed by
several illustrious ancient philosophers (Heraclitus, Parmenides,
Socrates, Plato), rather than an innovation of Arcesilaus (<em>Adv.
Col</em>. 1121F&ndash;1122A). For Plutarch, the Academic both
appreciates Plato&rsquo;s aporetic method of inquiry, inspired by
Socrates, and still values Plato&rsquo;s doctrines. Similar in this
respect appears to be the position of the anonymous author of the
(1<sup>st</sup> c. CE?) <em>Commentary on the Theaetetus</em> and of
Plutarch&rsquo;s friend Favorinus, the addressee of his <em>On the
Principle of Cold</em>, which Plutarch explicitly approves (<em>De
primo frigido</em> 955C, see Opsomer 1997, Opsomer 1998, 26&ndash;82,
213&ndash;240).</p>

<p>
In accordance with this conception of Platonism, Plutarch himself
writes dialogues, which, like Plato&rsquo;s, are either dramatic (e.g.
<em>On the Control of Anger</em>), narrated (e.g. <em>On Divine
Vengeance</em>), or mixed (<em>On the Daemon of Socrates</em>; see the
typology of Platonic dialogues in Diogenes Laertius 3.50). As in
Plato, in Plutarch&rsquo;s dialogues too the speakers give long
speeches in favor of a certain view (Russell 1973, 34&ndash;36). It is
often unclear, however, with what view Plutarch sympathizes, despite
the fact that sometimes he appears as character in some dialogues
(e.g. <em>On the E at Delphi</em>). Besides, Plutarch, following Plato
again, often uses myths, metaphors, and analogies. His late work
<em>On Isis and Osiris</em> is particularly interesting in this
regard. In it Plutarch relates the myth of the two Egyptian deities,
yet he interprets it allegorically as a story informative about God,
being, and creation (Ziegler 1951, 206&ndash;208, Petrucci 2015b). Of
special interest are Plutarch&rsquo;s eschatological myths, as they,
like Plato&rsquo;s integrate cosmological, psychological, and ethical
considerations. This is the case with the myth narrated in <em>On the
Face which Appears in the Orb of the Moon</em>, which centers on the
role of the moon in the world and its role in the life of souls (see
Cherniss, <em>Plutarch Moralia</em>, vol. XII, Loeb, Introduction).
Analogous is the case of the work <em>On the Delays of the Divine
Vengeance</em>, where Plutarch sets out to defend divine providence,
yet, following Plato&rsquo;s claim of presenting only a likely account
(<em>eik&ocirc;s mythos</em>) in the <em>Timaeus</em>, he claims to be
offering only what seems likely to him about divine actions
(549E&ndash;F), and also like Plato, Plutarch structures his work into
argument (<em>logos</em>) and a narrative (<em>mythos</em>). These
authorial practices present a problem for the scholar who wants to
identify Plutarch&rsquo;s own philosophical views, just as they do
with Plato&rsquo;s own dialogues. The works that unambiguously present
Plutarch&rsquo;s opinions on exegetical and philosophical matters are
<em>On the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus</em> and <em>Platonic
Questions</em>, while the others must be used with caution, for the
reasons given above, or because of their polemical aim and tone (see
Opsomer 2007, Opsomer 2023, 83&ndash;84).</p>

<p>
Plutarch represents a synthesis also with regard to his philosophical
interests. On the one hand, he shares Antiochus&rsquo; emphasis on
ethics, yet on the other he unlike Antiochus focuses considerably on
metaphysics, which was revived by Eudorus (end of 1<sup>st</sup> c.
BCE) and flourished with Neo-Pythagorean Platonists such as Moderatus
(1<sup>st</sup> c. CE). Like them, Plutarch (as noted above) pays
special attention to the <em>Timaeus</em>, which from then on became
the keystone of Platonism. Plutarch is particularly interested in the
generation of the world soul, and he devotes an entire treatise to
discussing one short passage, <em>Timaeus</em> 35a1&ndash;36b5 (<em>On
the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus</em>; see Cherniss, <em>Plutarch
Moralia</em>, Loeb vol. XIII.1, 133&ndash;149, Hershbell 1987). It is
not an exaggeration to say that Plutarch&rsquo;s interpretation of the
<em>Timaeus</em> shapes his entire philosophy. This is because
Plutarch apparently endorses the idea suggested in the
<em>Timaeus</em> that the universe is a unified whole of which humans
are an integral part. This means that both the physical world and
natural phenomena as well as human beings and human society should be
approached from a cosmic/metaphysical point of view. In the case of
natural phenomena explanations should make reference to intelligible
causes (<em>De primo frigido</em> 948B&ndash;C), while in the case of
human beings, their nature and their final end in life cannot be
determined unless one first understands that the human constitution is
similar to that of the world, consisting of body, soul, and intellect
(<em>De facie</em> 943A, 945A, <em>De virtute morali</em> 441D, <em>De
genio Socratis</em> 591D&ndash;F). Plutarch systematically employs the
analogy between worldly macrocosm and human microcosm, suggested in
the <em>Timaeus</em>, which is important also in Stoicism (see below,
sections 5, 6).</p>

<p>
Plutarch is well familiar with the Neo-Pythagoreanism and the
Aristotelianism, which were in vogue at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup>
century BCE and during the 1<sup>st</sup> century CE, when Plutarch
writes. There is a wave of Neo&ndash;Pythagorean treatises written at
this time, such as those of ps&ndash;Archytas, Euryphamus, Theages
(see Dillon 1977, 341&ndash;361, 1988b, 119&ndash;122, Centrone 1990,
Ulacco 2017), while Plutarch&rsquo;s contemporary Moderatus attempted
to systematize Pythagorean ideas as background to Plato (he wrote a
work <em>Pythagorean Doctrines</em> in many books; Stephanus
Byzantius, <em>s.v</em>. Gadeira, Porphyry, <em>Life of
Pythagoras</em> 48; Dillon 1977, 344&ndash;351). Aristotelian
philosophy, on the other hand, was revived by Peripatetics and
Platonists alike during this period. In the Peripatetic camp, this is
the time when Andronicus of Rhodes was active, being responsible for a
complete edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s works at the end of the
1<sup>st</sup> century BCE, while Xenarchus of Seleukeia was
critically engaged with Aristotle&rsquo;s physics. Around the same
time Antiochus and Cicero had been well acquainted with
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, the former arguing that Aristotle was in
essential agreement with Plato, at least in ethical theory (Cicero,
<em>Academica</em> I.17, <em>De finibus</em> V.12; Karamanolis 2006,
72&ndash;80). Antiochus&rsquo; students Aristo of Alexandria and
Cratippus regarded themselves as Peripatetics (<em>Index
Academicorum</em> col. 35.2&ndash;17 Dorandi), while the Platonust
Eudorus did not hesitate to use Aristotle in order to identify
Pythagorean metaphysical principles in Plato (Alexander, <em>In
Met.</em> 58.25&ndash;59.8 with reference to Aristotle
<em>Metaphysics</em> 988a8&ndash;17). Plutarch was familiar with
several Aristotelian treatises from all periods of his writing career
(cf. <em>Adv. Col.</em> 1115B&ndash;C) and, quite interestingly, he
preserves numerous fragments from lost Aristotelian works (see Ross,
<em>Aristotelis Fragmenta Selecta</em>, Karamanolis 2006,
89&ndash;92).</p>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s attitude to Pythagoreanism and Aristotle is complex
and sophisticated. Plutarch&rsquo;s cosmic principles, the One and the
Indefinite Dyad (<em>De def. or.</em> 428F&ndash;429A), allegedly
found in the <em>Timaeus</em>, had long been considered Pythagorean in
origin. Plutarch shows his familiarity with Pythagoreanism in the
second (and rather cryptic) part of <em>On the Generation of the Soul
in Timaeus</em>, where he seeks to explain the role of numbers and
ratios in the <em>Timaeus</em> making repeated references to
Pythagoreans. Plutarch also integrates into Platonism Pythagorean
elements such as number symbolism (<em>De E</em> 387F&ndash;388C,
<em>De def. or.</em> 429D&ndash;430B), abstinence from meat (<em>On
the Eating of Flesh; De esu carnium</em>), and a belief in the
rationality of animals (<em>On the Cleverness of Animals, Beasts are
Rational; Bruta Animalia Ratione Uti</em>), probably because he
considers them implied in, or compatible with, statements made in
Plato (e.g. in the <em>Phaedo, Timaeus</em>). With regard to
Aristotle, Plutarch is more cautious than Antiochus; he considers some
of Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrines to be an articulation or development of
Platonic philosophy (e.g. Aristotle&rsquo;s ethics, logic and science;
see Teodorsson 1999), and espouses them as being Platonic (e.g. <em>De
virtute morali</em> 442B&ndash;C<em>, De an. procr.</em> 1023E).
However, he also criticizes Aristotle for contradicting some of
Plato&rsquo;s presumed doctrines (e.g. on the Forms and on the
constitution of the world; <em>Adv. Col.</em> 1114F&ndash;1115C; see
Karamanolis 2006, 85&ndash;126).</p>

<p>
Hence it is wrong to portray Plutarch as an eclectic philosopher (e.g.
Ziegler 1951, 940, F. Babbitt, <em>Plutarch&rsquo;s Moralia</em>,
Introduction, vol. I, Loeb 1927, xiv, Becchi 1981), who occasionally
compromises his Platonism in order to carry out his polemic
(D&ouml;rrie 1971, Donini 1988b, 131, 1999, 16&ndash;19). Rather,
Plutarch uses philosophers such as Aristotle only instrumentally in
order to advance through them what he perceives as Plato&rsquo;s own
doctrines (Karamanolis 2006, 92&ndash;109). Apparently Plutarch shares
with Antiochus (Cicero, <em>Academica</em> I.17&ndash;19, 33&ndash;34)
the view that Plato&rsquo;s philosophy is subject to articulation and
development through his successors in the Platonist tradition, and
this is what he sets out to do himself (see e.g. <em>De def. or.</em>
428C&ndash;430B<em>)</em>, but also to misinterpretation and
distortion. On this view, Xenocrates, Polemo and Aristotle developed
and articulated Platonic philosophy, though not without faults, while
the Stoics and Epicureans were instead guilty of systematic
distortion. Analogous is the case of Numenius who attributes such a
distortion of Plato to the Academics, especially the sceptical ones
(fr. 24&ndash;28 Des Places), replying in a way to Plutarch&rsquo;s
advocacy of the sceptical Academy. Plutarch is not a populariser
either (Babbitt op. cit.). Rather, Plutarch&rsquo;s work shows great
complexity and sophistication and evinces the spirit of a meticulous
interpreter, who ventures to advance innovative views, such as on the
creation of the soul, on human constitution, as well as on ethics and
poetics (see below, sects. 6 and 7). It is also unfair to say of
Plutarch that he was &ldquo;no original thinker&rdquo; (Ziegler 1951,
938&ndash;939). Plutarch lived in an age in which philosophy had taken
the form of exegesis of classical philosophical texts, but through
this exegetical process philosophers in late antiquity (such as
Plotinus and the commentators on Plato and Aristotle) voice their own
views on crucial philosophical questions, which also serve as an
actualization and defence of the views of their philosophical
authorities. While engaged in exegesis, Plutarch takes some very
interesting lines on metaphysics, psychology, and ethics, which were
developed further by later generations of Platonists, such as Plotinus
and Porphyry (see below, sections 4, 5, 6).</p>

<h2><a name="ToK">3. Theory of Knowledge</a></h2>

<p>
Like the Hellenistic Philosophers and Antiochus, Plutarch appears to
be particularly sensitive to the question of how we acquire knowledge.
Plutarch sets out to defend the interpretation of Plato&rsquo;s
epistemology maintained in the skeptical Academy (cf. <em>De sera</em>
549E&ndash;F). According to this interpretation, suspension of
judgment (<em>epoch&ecirc;</em>) is the best way to avoid overhasty
commitment to opinions (<em>doxai</em>), since the appearances on
which they are based can be deceitful. Plutarch defends this
epistemological position against the Stoic accusation that such an
attitude leads to inaction, making life impossible, and also against
the Epicurean claim that sense-experiences are always true. Plutarch
distinguishes between three different movements in the soul, which are
identical to those assumed by the Stoics, namely those of perception
(<em>phantastikon</em>), impulse (<em>horm&ecirc;</em>), and assent
(<em>synkatathetikon</em>; <em>Adv. Col</em>. 1122B). The first two
alone, Plutarch argues, against the Stoics, suffice to produce action
(<em>Adv. Col</em>. 1122C&ndash;D). Since suspension of judgment does
not interfere with either perception or impulse, it does not affect
our actions but only eliminates opinions (ibid. 1122B). Consequently,
Plutarch argues, suspension of judgment saves us from making mistakes
(1124B) and promotes the search for knowledge. Suspension of
judgement, Plutarch argues, does not prevent us at all from acting.
Opsomer (1999, 88) has rightly noted that Plutarch&rsquo;s argument is
very similar to that of the Pyrrhonian skeptics. Plutarch recommends
suspension of judgment as a method of testing and evaluating knowledge
obtained through the senses (<em>Adv. Col.</em> 1124B). This is not
only because the senses often deceive us (<em>De primo frigido</em>
952A, <em>De E</em> 392E); the problem according to Plutarch rather is
that the world is a place that cannot be known perfectly. This,
however, does not amount to dismissal of the senses, which is how
Colotes criticized Plato (<em>Adv. Col</em>. 1114D&ndash;F). According
to Plutarch, the senses are of limited application because they can at
best inform us only about the sensible world, which is a world of
appearances, not of being (<em>De E</em> 392E&ndash;F). For a
Platonist like Plutarch, perfect knowledge can only be of being, and
for that we need to transcend the sensible world and move our thought
to the intelligible one (<em>De Iside</em> 382D&ndash;383A).</p>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s sharp distinction between sensible and intelligible
knowledge corresponds to the fundamental ontological distinction
between sensible or physical and intelligible reality (<em>Plat.
Q.</em> 1001E, 1002B&ndash;C). Correspondingly, he appears to
distinguish two distinct faculties of human knowledge, the sensory and
the intellectual, each of which grasps the corresponding part of
reality (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1002D&ndash;E). The cognitive faculty for
intelligibles, the human intellect, is external to the embodied soul
(<em>De an. procr.</em> 1026E, <em>Plat. Q</em>. 1001C, 1002F; cf.
Numenius fr. 42 Des Places); the sensory faculty, on the other hand,
comes about when the soul enters the body (<em>De virtute morali</em>
442B&ndash;F; see below, section 5), and provides the means for
dealing effectively in daily life with our needs and circumstances in
the physical world. In Plutarch&rsquo;s view, human beings come to
understand through the intellect by making use of the notions or
concepts (<em>ennoiai</em>), apparently identifiable with the Forms
(<em>Plat. Q</em>. 1001E), with which the intellect is inherently
equipped. That is, the embodied soul recollects what it knows from its
inherent familiarity with the intelligible realm, as Plato argued in
the discussion of <em>anamn&ecirc;sis</em> or recollection in the
<em>Meno</em> (<em>Plat. Q</em>. 1001D, 1002E; Opsomer 1998,
193&ndash;198). Given Plutarch&rsquo;s Platonism, it is not surprising
that he finds knowledge of intelligibles superior to sensory
&ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; which can only remain at the level of belief
(<em>pistis</em>) and conjecture (<em>eikasia</em>; <em>Plat. Q</em>.
1001D). Indeed, knowledge of intelligibles can take one as far as to
understand the divine realm (ibid. 1002E, 1004D). We can achieve this
kind of knowledge, Plutarch suggests, only when &ldquo;souls are free
to migrate to the realm of the indivisible and the unseen&rdquo;
(<em>De Iside</em> 382F).</p>

<p>
According to Plutarch, knowledge of intelligibles through
<em>anamn&ecirc;sis</em> is not in tension with the Academic
prescription for suspension of judgment (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1000E);
rather, knowledge can be advanced by suspension of judgment, since the
latter puts aside opinion (<em>doxa</em>) as well as egoism
(<em>philautia</em>), both of which prevent us from finding the truth
(<em>Plat. Q</em>. 1000C). To be in a position to carry out this
search for truth, however, one must search oneself and purify
one&rsquo;s soul, Plutarch argues (<em>Adv. Col</em>. 1118C&ndash;E).
And he points out that Socrates promoted this practice, using the
<em>elenchus</em> as a purgative medicine, trying to remove false
claims to knowledge and arrogance from the souls of his interlocutors,
and to seek truth along with them, instead of defending his own view
(<em>Plat. Q</em>. 999E&ndash;F, 1000B, 1000D; see Opsomer 1999,
145&ndash;150, Shiffman 2010). Socrates was in a position to do that
because he had purified his soul from passions (<em>De genio
Socratis</em> 588D&ndash;E), hence he was capable of understanding the
voice of his <em>daim&ocirc;n</em>, his intellect (see below, section
5). Plutarch presents Socrates as a model of someone who managed to
free his intellect from &ldquo;the tractions and tensions&rdquo;
exercised on it by passions and strong inward movements
(<em>ormai</em>; <em>De genio Socratis</em> 588F&ndash;589A).</p>

<p>
Plutarch does not defend the Socratic-Academic epistemology only at
the theoretical level, but also applies it practically in his own
philosophical inquiries. While discussing in <em>On the Principle of
Cold</em> whether cold is a principle rather than a privation and
whether earth is the primary cold element, he defends suspension of
judgment as the right attitude to take on the matter (955C; see Babut
2007, 72&ndash;76 contra Boys-Stones 1997b). This is indicative of
Plutarch&rsquo;s attitude to natural phenomena quite generally. He
maintains that natural phenomena cannot be understood merely by means
of investigating their natural causes. The discovery of the immediate
natural causes, Plutarch argues, is only the beginning of an
investigation into the first and highest causes, which are
intelligible (<em>De primo frigido</em> 948B&ndash;C; Donini 1986a,
210&ndash;211, Opsomer 1999, 215&ndash;6). In other words, a
metaphysical explanation in terms of the Forms and God, the creator of
the universe, must be sought (<em>De def. or.</em> 435E&ndash;436A).
This is what, for Plutarch, demarcates the philosopher from the mere
natural scientist (<em>physikos</em>; <em>De primo frigido</em>
948B&ndash;C), a distinction further exploited by later Platonists
(e.g. Atticus fr. 5 Des Places, Porphyry in Simplicius, <em>In
Phys.</em> 9.10&ndash;13; fr. 119 Smith). Plutarch is guided here by
the dichotomy between natural and intelligible causes found in
<em>Phaedo</em> 97B&ndash;99D and <em>Timaeus</em> 68E&ndash;69D
(Opsomer 1999, 183). Explaining the physical world through an appeal
to natural causes alone is insufficient, Plutarch argues, since such
an explanation ignores the agent (God) and the end for which something
happens in the world (<em>De def. or.</em> 435E). The fundamental
Platonist ontological and epistemological distinction between the
sensible and intelligible realms suggests to Plutarch an analogous
distinction of corresponding levels of explanation (Donini 1986a, 212,
Opsomer 1999, 217). Plutarch maintains that there are two levels of
causality, physical and intelligible, and full understanding of
natural phenomena requires the grasping of both. While in the case of
natural phenomena suspension of judgment maintains an unfailing spirit
of research, in the case of the divine realm, where human
understanding is seriously limited (cf. <em>De Iside</em>
354B&ndash;C), suspension of judgment and continuous inquiry (<em>De
Iside</em> 351E, 352C) are recommended, also as a form of piety
towards the divine (<em>De sera</em> 549E&ndash;F; Opsomer 1999,
178&ndash;179).</p>

<h3><a name="FirPri">4.1 First Principles</a></h3>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s metaphysics rests heavily on his interpretation of
the <em>Timaeus</em>. Plutarch maintains that the cosmogony of the
<em>Timaeus</em> must be interpreted literally, which means that the
world had a temporal beginning (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1001B&ndash;C,
<em>De an. procr.</em> 1013C&ndash;1024C; cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 30a,
52d&ndash;53b). Plutarch argues against the interpretation of most
Platonists of his time, who refuse to understand creation in terms of
an actual generation (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1013D&ndash;E). He
appears to believe that his interpretation is the only way to
understand Plato&rsquo;s claim that the soul is &ldquo;senior&rdquo;
to the body (<em>Timaeus</em> 34c), and that it initiates all change
and motion (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1013D&ndash;F; <em>Phaedrus</em>
245c, <em>Laws</em> 896a&ndash;c). This literal interpretation of the
<em>Timaeus</em> also aims to solve the puzzle of how the soul in
Plato is said to be both uncreated (<em>Phaedrus</em> 245c&ndash;246a)
as well as created (<em>Timaeus</em> 34b&ndash;35a; <em>De an.
procr.</em> 1016A), and how the soul is said to be a mixed entity
composed of indivisible being (i.e. intellect) and divisible being
(i.e. the non-rational pre-cosmic soul; <em>Timaeus</em> 35a; <em>De
an. procr</em>. 1014D&ndash;E, 1024A). Plutarch tries to address these
issues in a number of works (see above, section 1), most importantly,
of the surviving ones, in <em>On the Generation of Soul in the
Timaeus</em>, a commentary on <em>Timaeus</em> 35a1&ndash;36b5, as
noted above, but also in <em>On Isis and Osiris</em>, a rich but
difficult work, open to many interpretations (see most recently
Ferrari 1995, O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 83&ndash;84, Petrucci 2015a,
2015b).</p>

<p>
Plutarch does not outline anywhere one interpretation of how the world
has come about. The student of his work must reconstruct one, taking
into account several works of his, which often host (at least
apparently) contradictory or ambiguous views. I suggest the following
interpretation as one that in my view emerges from Plutarch&rsquo;s
work. The cosmos is an ordered entity that has come into existence at
a certain point (when time did not exist; <em>Plat. Q</em>. 1007C) as
a result of the contact between God the demiurge, and pre-existing,
disorderly matter, which is animated by a disorderly world soul. God
the demiurge puts matter in order (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1024C; cf.
<em>De Iside</em> 374E&ndash;F), which means that God cannot be the
only cosmic principle, otherwise disorderly matter would be left
unaccounted for. Plutarch postulates two opposing and antagonistic
cosmic principles: the one is God (the Monad or the One, the unitary
eternal substance from which everything devolves; see below section
4.3), and the other is the Indefinite Dyad, both principles being
eternal and uncreated (<em>De def. or</em>. 428E&ndash;F, <em>De
Iside</em> 369C&ndash;D, 371A&ndash;B). God is the real being,
unchangeable, simple (<em>De E</em> 392E&ndash;393B), and good (<em>De
def. or.</em> 423D)&mdash;the cause of order, intelligibility,
stability, and identity in the universe, which is why God is the
object of striving for all nature (<em>De facie</em> 944E). The
Indefinite Dyad, on the other hand, is the principle of non-being,
multiplicity, disorder, irrationality and badness (<em>De def.
or</em>. 428F). This principle is described as being identical with
matter which is ordered by God (<em>De def. or</em>. 428F&ndash;429D)
or by its <em>logos</em> (<em>De Iside</em> 373A&ndash;C), yet the
existence in it of an active element which is essentially disorderly
and evil (<em>De Iside</em> 369D&ndash;F; Dillon 1977, 206&ndash;8)
seems to suggest that the Indefinite Dyad is regarded not merely as
identical as the underlying element of all qualities, as suggested in
<em>Timaeus</em> 50e (<em>De def. or</em>. 414F). These two
principles, God and the Indefinite Dyad, were allegedly accepted by
the ancient Pythagoreans (Diogenes Laertius 8.24&ndash;25; Diels-Kranz
58 &Beta;l), and by the Pythagoreans of Plutarch&rsquo;s time (Sextus
Empiricus, <em>Against the Mathematicians</em> 10.261&ndash;284,
Nicomachus, <em>Introductio Arithmetica</em> II.18.4; see Dillon 1977,
342&ndash;3, 354), but they were also attributed to Plato (Plato,
<em>Parmenides</em> 149d2, Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em>
453.25&ndash;7) by neo-Pythagorean Platonists (Eudorus in Simplicius,
<em>In Phys.</em> 181.7&ndash;30, Moderatus, ibid. 231.8&ndash;9; see
Kahn 2001, 105&ndash;110 and Numenius in SEP). Plutarch identifies the
two principles with the Limited and the Unlimited of the
<em>Philebus</em> (he also calls the Indefinite Dyad
&ldquo;limitlessness&rdquo;, <em>apeiria</em>; and
&ldquo;formlessness&rdquo;, <em>amorphia</em>, <em>De def. or.</em>
428F, <em>De E</em> 391B&ndash;C<strong>)</strong>. The two principles
are constantly opposing each other in the form of goodness and badness
(<em>De def. or</em>. 429A&ndash;D, cf. <em>De Iside</em>
369D&ndash;F; Dillon 1977, 203, Boys-Stones 2018, 144&ndash;145).
Although God, the One, prevails over the Dyad (<em>De def. or</em>.
429B&ndash;D), and in this sense is the dominant cosmic principle,
order and goodness are always in danger of being displaced by disorder
and badness. Both the Indefinite Dyad and God relate to the universe
through intermediaries, a non-rational and a rational world soul (see
above), which operate as antithetic powers of the two antagonistic
cosmic principles. The result of the interaction of the two cosmic
principles through these powers is the cosmos in which humans live
(<em>De Iside</em> 373B, see Boys-Stones 2018, 114, 122&ndash;123,
Petrucci 2015b).</p>

<p>
This interaction appears to happen in stages. Before the world has
come into being, the universe was animated by the non-rational world
soul, which accounts for the disordered motion of matter. In
Plutarch&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;what preceded the generation of the
world was disorder, disorder not incorporeal or immobile or inanimate,
but of corporeality amorphous and incoherent, and of motivity demented
and irrational, and this was the discord of soul that has not
reason&rdquo; (<em>De an. procr</em>. 1014B; Cherniss&rsquo; trans.
altered). Plato speaks indeed of the receptacle as amorphous
(<em>Timaeus</em> 50d7, 51a7). There is, however, no explicit mention
of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul in the <em>Timaeus</em>, which is
why Plutarch has been accused of arbitrariness in this regard
(Cherniss, <em>Plutarch Moralia</em>, Loeb vol. XIII.1,
140&ndash;147). It is wrong, though, to treat Plutarch as one might
treat a modern commentator of the <em>Timaeus</em>, with conscientious
scholarly attention to what is and what is not made explicit in a
text. Plutarch assumes that Plato expresses a single &ldquo;Platonic
view&rdquo; in his mature works, about the generation of the world,
the first principles of reality, and the role of soul in the
world&rsquo;s generation. He identifies the non-rational soul with the
&ldquo;disorderly and maleficent soul&rdquo; of <em>Laws</em> X (a
testimony Plutarch himself considers unambiguous, <em>De Iside</em>
370F), with the &ldquo;limitlessness&rdquo; of the <em>Philebus</em>
(26b), the &ldquo;congenital desire&rdquo; and &ldquo;inbred
character&rdquo; of the <em>Politicus</em> (272d, 273b), and with the
necessity (<em>anank&ecirc;</em>) and the generation
(<em>genesis</em>) of <em>Timaeus</em> 52d (<em>De an. procr</em>.
1014D&ndash;1015A). None of these passages lend clear support to
Plutarch&rsquo;s interpretation, since nowhere does Plato explicitly
speak of a pre-cosmic maleficent soul or other pre-cosmic soul-like
entities: even the maleficent soul of the <em>Laws</em> is not
pre-cosmic (Cherniss, ibid. 140). Yet Plutarch&rsquo;s interpretation
does have merits in imposing consistency on Plato&rsquo;s work as a
whole in the following sense. First, according to the <em>Timaeus</em>
(35a) the demiurge does not create the substance of the soul, but
compounds the world soul by blending indivisible with divisible being,
which Plutarch not unreasonably identifies with the divine intellect
and the non-rational world soul respectively (<em>De an. procr</em>.
1014D&ndash;E); this does justice to the nature of the soul, which for
Platonists is not subject to change and corruption. Secondly, it was
generally assumed that no motion is possible without a principle of
motion (cf. Aristotle, <em>De anima</em> 402a6&ndash;7), and this
traditionally is identified with the soul in Platonism (cf.
<em>Phaedrus</em> 245c&ndash;e); so the disordered motion of matter
before the creation of cosmos that Plato outlines in the
<em>Timaeus</em> needs to be accounted for by a soul (see
<em>Laws</em> 892a), which must, then, be a pre-cosmic one (<em>De an.
procr</em>. 1015E).</p>

<p>
The existence of a such a soul is suggested also if one considers the
world soul and the human soul in conjunction. Already the
<em>Timaeus</em> (34c, 41d&ndash;e, 69c) suggests a relation between
the two. Plutarch takes the human soul to be derivative from the world
soul, which means that their natures are similar (<em>De an.
procr</em>. 1025A&ndash;D; see below, section 5). In <em>Republic</em>
4, in the <em>Phaedrus</em>, and also in the <em>Timaeus</em> it is
argued that the human soul has a rational and a non-rational aspect,
fighting for dominance. And it is suggested that order and harmony are
established in the soul when the rational aspect rules over the
non-rational, even if the non-rational aspect is always capable of
revolting against rationality and creating disorder and badness.
Plutarch identifies the rational aspect with intellect, which he
distinguishes from the soul, making the former the cause of order and
goodness and the latter the cause of disorder and badness (<em>De an.
procr.</em> 1015E; see below, section 5). If the human soul reflects
the nature of the world soul, then also in the latter, even when
rationality prevails, which is when the cosmos comes into being, there
is room for disharmony and disorder. This is evidenced by occurrences
of badness in the world, such as accidents, natural catastrophes, etc.
If there is no such non-rational aspect in the world soul to account
for for such phenomena, then either God must be ultimately accountable
for them, which is what according to Plutarch the Stoics maintain
&ndash; and this, argues Plutarch, hardly fits God&rsquo;s goodness
(<em>De an. procr</em>. 1015A&ndash;B, <em>De comm. not</em>. 1076D);
or it may be due to matter (as Numenius later maintained, fr. 52 Des
Places), but this according to Plutarch is also impossible, because
matter is without any quality (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1015C); or they
must happen without cause, as the Epicureans maintain, which then
diminishes God&rsquo;s ruling power (<em>De an. procr</em>. 1015C).
Better to think that such occurrences are caused by the non-rational
aspect of the world soul. Finally, a pre-cosmic soul is needed to play
the role of mediator between God and matter (<em>De an. procr.</em>
1015B, 1024C; cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 35a), which is required in order to
maintain God&rsquo;s transcendence, goodness, and purity, since
matter, because of its inherent disorderliness, pollutes and taints,
and thus is hardly worthy of God (cf. Numenius fr. 52.37&ndash;39 Des
Places; see also below, section 4.3).</p>

<p>
The first stage in creation is God&rsquo;s imparting his own
intelligence and reason to the pre-cosmic non-rational soul, making it
into a partly rational thing (<em>De an. procr</em>. 1014C&ndash;D,
1016E&ndash;D, <em>Plat. Q.</em> 1001B&ndash;C). Plutarch makes clear
that the rational world soul is &ldquo;not merely a work but also a
part of God and has come to be not by his agency, but both from him as
a source and out of his substance&rdquo; (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1001C).
Since the world soul, thus constructed, contains divine reason, which
is a &ldquo;portion&rdquo; (<em>moira</em>) or &ldquo;efflux&rdquo;
(<em>aporrho&ecirc;</em>) of God (<em>De Iside</em> 382B), it is not
merely a product of God but rather an inseparable part of him (<em>De
sera</em> 559D, <em>Plat. Q</em>. 1001C). That is, the world soul
becomes assimilated to God (<em>De sera</em> 550D), which means that
the motions produced by the world soul become now (for the most part)
harmonious and orderly (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1014C&ndash;E). Matter
now becomes stable, ordered, &ldquo;similar to the entities that are
invariably identical&rdquo; (ibid. 1015F). Presumably Plutarch is
referring here to the transcendent Forms. He states that the cosmos
comes into being when the soul disperses the semblances from the
intelligible world to this one (ibid. 1024C; cf. <em>Timaeus</em>
50c&ndash;e, 52d&ndash;53c). Plutarch appears to maintain that the
world soul is capable of being molded by receiving the intelligible
Forms, which is how presumably the world soul becomes rational (<em>De
an. procr.</em> 1024C). The world soul transmits the Forms then onto
matter (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1024C, <em>De Iside</em> 373A, <em>De
Pyth. orac</em>. 404C). This transmission seems to take a two-stage
process, allegedly implied in the <em>Timaeus</em>. First, the Forms
inform matter to bring about primary bodies, such as water and fire,
as <em>Timaeus</em> 53b&ndash;d, 69b&ndash;c suggest (<em>De an.
procr.</em> 1025A&ndash;B, <em>Plat. Q.</em> 1001D&ndash;E); second,
the imposition of further Forms on matter brings about compound
material stuffs and different kinds of objects, which make up the
cosmos (<em>De Iside</em> 372E&ndash;F, 373E&ndash;F).</p>

<p>
The precise role of Forms in Plutarch&rsquo;s interpretation of the
creation remains obscure. Plutarch discussed this issue in treatises
no longer extant, such as, for example, <em>Where are the Forms?</em>,
but the relevant surviving evidence is inconclusive (see, though,
Schoppe 1994, Ferrari 1995, 1996b). Some insight can be gained from
the myth of Isis and Osiris, which Plutarch presents as an analogy to
the world creation in his <em>On</em> <em>Isis and Osiris</em>. Osiris
is a divine intellect opposed by Typhon, apparently the disorderly
world soul (371A&ndash;B). Osiris imposes in Isis the shapes and forms
(<em>morphas kai ideas</em>) of himself (<em>De Iside</em>
372E&ndash;F), eventually producing Horus, i.e. the cosmos, an image
of the intelligible world (ibid. 373B, 374A, <em>De an. procr.</em>
1026C). Osiris is identified with the good itself (372E), to which
Isis always inclines (372F), offering herself to be impregnated
&ldquo;with effluxes and likenesses in which she rejoices&rdquo;
(ibid. 373A). Apparently Osiris stands for the demiurge of the
<em>Timaeus</em> and the Form of the Good of the <em>Republic</em>
(<em>De Iside</em> 372F, cf. <em>De an. procr</em>. 1017 A&ndash;B,
see O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 82&ndash;87), which explains why Osiris
constitutes the object of desire by nature (<em>De Iside</em>
372E&ndash;F; cf. <em>De facie</em> 944E), whereas Isis stands for the
receptacle or both the receptacle and the orderly world soul (<em>De
Iside</em> 372E&ndash;F, <em>De an. procr.</em> 1026C;
<em>Timaeus</em> 49a, 51a; for the relevant scholarly debate see
Dillon 1977, 204&ndash;206, Deuse 1983, 37&ndash;42, Ferrari 1995,
74&ndash;114, Petrucci 2015b, Boys-Stones 2018, 114&ndash;115). This
suggests that Plutarch probably maintained the existence of the Forms
in God (cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 39e), as did several other Platonists in
late antiquity (e.g. Alcinous, <em>Didascalikos</em> 163.11&ndash;17,
with Dillon 1993, 93&ndash;96). This is supported by the fact that for
Plutarch Osiris is both the intellect and the <em>logos</em> present
in the world soul (<em>De Iside</em> 371A, 373B, 376C, <em>De an.
procr.</em> 1023C&ndash;D) and by Plutarch&rsquo;s claim that God is
the totality of Forms (<em>paradeigma</em>; <em>De sera</em> 550D; see
Helmig 2005, 20&ndash;26). However, it is not clear how exactly for
Plutarch the Forms exist in God, since in Plutarch&rsquo;s view God,
in the form of Osiris, can probably be analyzed into three elements,
intellect, soul, and body (<em>De Iside</em> 373A). That Plutarch
makes such a distinction with regard to God is also supported by his
claim that &ldquo;God is not senseless nor inanimate nor subject to
human control&rdquo; (<em>De Iside</em> 377E&ndash;F) and also by his
reference to the body of Osiris, which symbolizes the Forms immanent
in matter (ibid.; Dillon 1977, 200). Presumably Plutarch assumes the
existence of a divine soul, guided by statements in Plato
<em>Philebus</em> 30c, <em>Sophist</em> 248d&ndash;249a,
<em>Timaeus</em> 46d&ndash;e, according to which the intellect, to the
extent that it implies life, requires the presence of the principle of
life, namely soul (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1002F).</p>

<p>
There is a question as to where in the divine creator the transcendent
Forms reside (Schoppe 1994, Ferrari 1996b, O&rsquo;Brien 2015,
86&ndash;87, Boys-Stones 2018, 125&ndash;146). It has been suggested
that Plutarch places the Forms not in the intellect of the divine
creator as thoughts, as was assumed by Platonists such as Alcinous,
Plotinus, but rather in the soul (Schoppe 1994, 172&ndash;178, Baltes
2000; against Opsomer 2001, 195&ndash;197), since Syrianus testifies
to this (<em>In Met.</em> 105.36&ndash;38) and since we find this
doctrine in Atticus (frs. 8, 11, 35 Des Places; Karamanolis 2006,
169&ndash;170), who was said in antiquity to follow Plutarch in the
interpretation of the cosmogony of the <em>Timaeus</em> (Iamblichus,
<em>De anima</em>, in Stobaeus 1.49.37, Proclus, <em>In Tim.</em>
1.276.30&ndash;277.7, 325.30&ndash;326.6; Atticus frs. 10, 19, 22 Des
Places). The reason for endorsing such a view could have been that it
allows one to maintain the utter simplicity and the unity of the
demiurgic intellect, a path already taken by Moderatus (Dillon 1977,
348). Plutarch, however, does not take a clear position on that issue
in his extant works, neither does he distinguish between levels of
being in the intelligible realm as later Platonists do. He does refer
to being, the receptacle, and <em>genesis</em> in <em>Timaeus</em>
52d2&ndash;4 (<em>De an. procr</em>. 1024C&ndash;D), identifying the
last with the non-rational soul, the receptacle with matter, and being
with the intelligible realm, while he also mentions an intellect
&ldquo;abiding and immobile all by itself,&rdquo;(ibid. 1024C). This,
however, is not evidence that Plutarch adds arbitrarily a fourth
entity to the three mentioned above, the divine intellect, as Cherniss
(<em>Plutarch Moralia</em>, Loeb XIII.1, 143) argued. Apparently
Plutarch understands &ldquo;being&rdquo; in <em>Timaeus</em> 52d2 as
equivalent to &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in <em>Timaeus</em> 39e8, namely as
that which comprises both the divine intellect and the intelligible
Forms in a unity.</p>

<h3><a name="FatWhaUpUs">4.2 Fate and what is up to us</a></h3>

<p>
The antagonism between God and the Indefinite Dyad, between intellect
and soul, between the rational and the non-rational aspect of the
world soul, and ultimately between goodness and badness is an
entrenched feature of the world, according to Plutarch (<em>De
Iside</em> 369A&ndash;B). Plutarch criticizes the Epicureans and the
Stoics, who postulate either bodies or God respectively as active
principles of the world (<em>De Iside</em> 369A). As Plutarch says, if
God is the author of nothing, there is only badness, if God is the
author of everything, there is only goodness, since God can only be
the principle of goodness (<em>De Iside</em> 371A cf.
<em>Republic</em> 379c, <em>Theaetetus</em> 176a), but both exist in
the world in harmony, that is, in a world dominated by the good
(<em>De Iside</em> 369B&ndash;D). Plutarch expresses his dualism also
in religious-symbolic terms: he equates the pair of good and evil
principles with the Persian pair of gods Oromazes and Areimanius
(<em>De Iside</em> 369D&ndash;E). His pervasive dualism gives rise to
problems, however. The constant presence and operation of the
disorderly, non-rational aspect of the soul in the universe (<em>De
an. procr</em>. 1027A), implies God&rsquo;s failure to exercise
complete control. Plutarch appears to maintain that God&rsquo;s power
is limited by the necessity (<em>anank&ecirc;</em>) imposed by matter.
Yet, he does distinguish between the role of nature, or fate, on the
one hand, and divine providence on the other, arguing, against the
Stoics, that God can dominate nature (<em>De facie</em> 927A&ndash;B)
and can function providentially for us (<em>De comm. not</em>. 1075E,
<em>De Iside</em> 371A, <em>De def. orac.</em> 413E &ndash;Ammonius
speaking). The fact that God, by means of his <em>logos</em>, with
which he is often identified (<em>De Iside</em> 373A&ndash;B), moulds
the principle of disorder, the Indefinite Dyad, suggests to Plutarch
the supremacy of God over any other force. This is actually one of the
reasons why Plutarch defends temporal creation; for if the world were
eternal and God responsible for it, then God would be the cause of
both good and bad, which is impossible, while on Plutarch&rsquo;s
interpretation of the <em>Timaeus</em> badness is accounted for by the
evil world soul, which, as has been said above, according to Plutarch
is pre-cosmic (see Dillon 2002, 234; see also below, section 4.3).</p>

<p>
The problem however remains and it becomes more serious if we move
from the cosmic macrocosm to the human microcosm. For if disorder,
non-rationality, and badness are cosmic forces, producing what is bad
in the world, the question is how they relate to vice and the badness
caused by human beings. Plutarch distinguishes three causes
responsible for what happens in our lives, fate, chance, and ourselves
as causes of what is up to us, all of which play a role in what
happens to us (<em>Quaest. Conv</em>. 740C&ndash;D). The first two
kinds of causes need some explanation in view of his metaphysical
principles. Presumably, fate amounts to God, chance to the
non-rational part of the world soul, since the latter can bring about
events not planned by God which are disorderly and evil.
Plutarch&rsquo;s distinction introduces three corresponding classes of
events. Some events are fated (or planned by God), some happen by
chance (or through the operation of the non-rational aspect of the
world soul), while for a third class of events we, humans, are the
only causes (<em>De tranq. an</em>. 476E). We can, Plutarch says,
decide what to do, how to live our lives, but not how life will turn
out in terms of desired or intended outcomes of our actions (ibid.
467A&ndash;B; Eliasson 2008, 130&ndash;141). In this regard he
criticizes the Stoics for violating this distinction, arguing that the
Stoic notion of &ldquo;that which is up to us&rdquo; coincides with
the Stoic notion of fate (<em>De Stoic. repugn</em>. 1056E&ndash;D).
It is unclear, however, how according to Plutarch our participation in
the intelligible realm through soul and intellect accounts for our
character, since we share characteristics both of the (originally
non-rational) world soul and the (naturally rational) divine
intellect.</p>

<h3><a name="The">4.3 Theology</a></h3>

<p>
Plutarch&rsquo;s conception of God is an important aspect of
Plutarch&rsquo;s philosophy, given his involvement in the Delphic
religious activity. He indeed claims that philosophers seek and long
for the divine (<em>De Iside</em> 351E). Plutarch distinguishes
sharply between God or the divine (<em>theos, to theion</em>) and
gods, and the question is how the plurality of gods is to be
understood vis-&agrave;-vis the first or highest God (Ziegler 1951,
940). Plutarch appears to maintain that the first God can take
different names, although he is to be distinguished from the deities
of the Greek pantheon (such as Asclepius in <em>Amatorius</em>
758A&ndash;B), who are to be identified with the lesser gods. In the
<em>On the E at Delphi</em> Apollo is presented as the highest God,
identical with the sun (393C&ndash;394A), while elsewhere it is Zeus
who is described as the supreme God, creator of the universe (<em>De
facie</em> 927B). Plutarch was very interested in deities of other
religions, in the Egyptian, the Iranian deities, and in Mithraism. He
appears to maintain that gods appear with different names in different
traditions (<em>De Iside</em> 376A), and he also claims that different
religious mysteries converge toward the same view about the divine,
which is why they can function as an introduction to philosophy
(<em>De superst</em>. 166A, 169C; <em>De Iside</em> 363C&ndash;D;
<em>Quaest. conv</em>. 671CD, 669B&ndash;672C; <em>Amatorius</em>
771C; see Bonazzi 2021). Plutarch speaks of an ancient wisdom that has
been transmitted to various nations in different ways (<em>De
Iside</em> 369B; cf. Numenius fr. 1a Des Places), such as through
religious myths, and recommends their philosophical that is
allegorical interpretation (<em>De Iside</em> 355C&ndash;D), which he
himself requires from the reader to apply to myths such as that of
Isis and Osiris. Plutarch appears to be a universalist about the
divine, as Numenius and Porphyry will be later, that is, maintaining
that the deities of different religious traditions capture an aspect
of the universal divine.</p>

<p>
According to Plutarch the first God is a unity of utter simplicity, a
unity including all divine beings in it (<em>De Iside</em> 377F), and
is to be identified with the Good and with Being (<em>De E</em>
393B&ndash;D; see Opsomer 2009, 158&ndash;160), which means that the
first God identifies with the Form of the Good of the
<em>Republic</em> and with the demiurge of the <em>Timaeus</em> (see
Ferrari 2005, Brenk 2005), a tendency that Numenius and Plotinus will
resist later. God rules over the world and provides for it, but being
supreme (<em>an&ocirc;tat&ocirc;</em>; <em>Plat. Quest</em>. 1000E),
father of gods and men alike, he remains transcendent. This is
highlighted in Ammonius&rsquo; speech in <em>On the E in Delphi</em>,
where God is said to be &ldquo;beyond everything&rdquo; (<em>epekeina
tou pantos</em>; 393B), but also in the <em>On the Obsolescence of
Oracles</em>, where Lamprias defends the possibility of God being
provident over many worlds, provided that these are finite in number
(426E). God&rsquo;s transcendence is maintained by delegating to the
world soul some mediatory demiurgic performance (see above, section
4.1; cf. Opsomer 2005, 94&ndash;5). This resonates with
Plutarch&rsquo;s more general view (inspired by Plato), according to
which the soul has a mediating role between the intellect and the body
or sensible reality (see below, section 5).</p>

<p>
Apart from the world soul, the creator God needs some further
mediation with the sensible world if his transcendence is to be
maintained&mdash;this is already suggested in the distinction between
the demiurge and the lesser gods in the <em>Timaeus</em> (42e).
Plutarch acknowledges the existence of divine entities inferior to the
first God but also to the lesser gods of the <em>Timaeu</em>s, namely
the &ldquo;<em>daimones.</em>&rdquo; They are said to be &ldquo;by
nature on the boundary between gods and humans&rdquo; (<em>De def.
or</em>. 416C). Placed in the moon, these lesser gods mediate between
the first God and human beings, thus extending God&rsquo;s providence
to them (Dillon 1977, 216&ndash;8). In this respect Plutarch inherits
a tradition going back to Empedocles, to Plato (<em>Symposium</em>
202d&ndash;203e, <em>Phaedo</em> 107D, 113D, <em>Republic</em> 427b,
620d, <em>Timaeus</em> 90a&ndash;d), and to Xenocrates, who is
explicitly mentioned in this connection (<em>De Iside</em>
360E&ndash;F, <em>De def. or.</em> 416C&ndash;D). The precise role of
the demons in Plutarch becomes an interesting issue in view of the
fact that he speaks of two kinds of demons, good and bad, and indeed
he claims that demons exhibit different degrees of virtue and vice, as
is the case with men too (<em>De def. or.</em> 417B, <em>De Iside</em>
360E). Plutarch provides us with evidence according to which the role
of demons consists in communicating God&rsquo;s will to humans,
bestowing them with prophetic powers and inspiration
(<em>Amatorius</em> 758E, <em>De genio Socratis</em> 580C, <em>De
facie</em> 944C&ndash;D), in taking care of humans when they are needy
(<em>Amatorius</em> 758A&ndash;B), in taking care of the sanctuaries
and the sacred rites (<em>De def. or.</em> 417A&ndash;B), but also in
punishing humans and avenging human bad acts (ibid.). The latter is
the role of the bad demons. Apparently Plutarch maintained that proper
punishment is never vengeful. This emerges when Plutarch discusses the
question of divine punishment in his work <em>On the Delays of the
Divine Vengeance</em>.</p>

<p>
In this work Plutarch examines an issue with which philosophers of his
age are seriously concerned, that of theodicy. Even if God is not
responsible for occurrences of evil (see above, section 4.2), there is
a question of why these are not always punished promptly by God. In
his treatise <em>On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance</em> Plutarch
addresses the question of whether the delays of divine punishment
speak against the existence of divine providence (550C) and he replies
that this is not the case. God, he argues, acts on reason, not on
passionate anger or impulse (551A, 557E), thus avoiding errors, and by
doing so, Plutarch continues, he sets the model for our own actions
(ibid.). On the other hand, Plutarch argues that human wickedness is
not always to be punished, because it itself ruins the life of those
who act thus, and this is already a sufficient punishment (ibid.
556D&ndash;E). Besides, Plutarch suggests, the punishment of the
divine does not have to be obvious; it can actually take place in the
afterlife of the soul, as is suggested in <em>Republic</em> 10, so
Plutarch claims that &ldquo;it is one and the same argument
&hellip;that establishes both the providence of God and the survival
of the human soul&rdquo; (560F; see also below, section 5).</p>

<h2><a name="Psy">5. Psychology</a></h2>

<p>
As a Platonist Plutarch regards soul as responsible for all life and
all motion. The world and all living beings have soul. While in Plato
soul sometimes includes (or is even restricted to) intellect (e.g.
<em>Phaedo</em> 94b) and sometimes not (e.g. <em>Phaedrus</em> 247c,
<em>Timaeus</em> 69c&ndash;e), Plutarch distinguishes sharply between
soul and intellect (<em>De an. procr.</em> 1024C, <em>De genio
Socr.</em> 591D&ndash;E). He criticizes the Stoics who analyze the
nature of man in two parts, body and soul, for disregarding the
intellect (<em>De facie</em> 943A&ndash;B; see Alt 1993, 94&ndash;6).
Plutarch argues against them that &ldquo;as soul is superior to body
so is intellect better and more divine than soul&rdquo; (<em>De
facie</em> 943A &ndash; inspired presumably by passages in Plato such
as <em>Phaedrus</em> 247c and <em>Timaeus</em> 30b, 90a). For Plutarch
the threefold distinction of the individual person (body, soul, and
intellect) has its equivalent in the universe at large. As the human
soul is intermediary between body and intellect, similarly, the world
soul is intermediary between earth and sun (<em>De facie</em> 943A,
945A, <em>De virtute morali</em> 441D, <em>Plat. Q.</em> 1002C; see
Deuse 1985, 45&ndash;47, Opsomer 1994). The human soul and the world
soul are of similar nature and composed of the same elements. The
intellect is external to the soul (cf. <em>Phaedrus</em>
247c&ndash;d), cosmic and human, and souls partake of it (<em>Plat.
Q.</em> 1003A, <em>De an. procr.</em> 1014E, <em>De genio Socr.</em>
591D). The world soul is informed by the reason of the creator God,
the demiurge, while in the case of humans the intellect amounts to the
&ldquo;<em>daim&ocirc;n</em>&rdquo; assigned to each of us (<em>De
genio Socratis</em> 591E, <em>Plat. Q.</em> 1000D&ndash;E), which is
what <em>Republic</em> 620d and, especially, <em>Timaeus</em>
90a&ndash;d suggest. This has as a consequence that our souls have a
kinship to the divine (<em>Plat. Q.</em> 1000D&ndash;E, 1004D), as is
the case also with the world soul. Plutarch argues that all ensouled
beings exhibit the presence of the divine intellect (<em>De Iside</em>
382A&ndash;B). However, as has been said above (section 4.1), an
element of non-rationality always remains in souls (<em>De an.
procr</em>. 1027A). Plutarch claims that this element is present in
different degrees, depending on how much a soul partakes of intellect
(<em>De genio Socratis</em> 588 D, 591D&ndash;E). On this basis,
Plutarch argues, against the Stoics, that animals also share in reason
(<em>De sollertia animalium</em> esp. 960B). The extent to which a
soul partakes of reason largely depends on the training and the habits
of that soul itself. Strong emotions, for instance, distance soul from
intellect and increase its non-rationality (<em>De genio Socratis</em>
591D; see Dillon 1977, 212&ndash;213).</p>

<p>
Plutarch maintains that there is a constant interaction between
intellect, soul, and body. This interaction manifests itself both at a
psychological and at an ethical level. The soul as such accounts for
sense perception, while the intellect accounts for intelligence
(<em>De an. procr</em>. 1032B&ndash;C, 1024A&ndash;B). Clearly,
though, sense perception is an activity involving both the senses and
the notions residing in the intellect (see above, section 3). It is
the intellect that orders our sense impressions and brings about
understanding (<em>De genio Socratis</em> 589A&ndash;B). Analogously,
the interaction of soul and body gives rise to non-rational movement
or passion, while the interaction between intellect and soul brings
about rational movements and virtue (<em>De sera</em> 566A&ndash;D,
591D&ndash;F; see Dillon 1977, 194). Plutarch actually suggests that
the soul that is devoid of intellect comes close to being
quasi-corporeal (<em>De sera</em> 566A; Teodorsson 1994, 120).
Regarding the embodied soul, Plutarch appears to be guided by
Aristotle&rsquo;s view in the <em>De anima</em> (see also
<em>Phaedo</em> 82d&ndash;e), arguing that the soul uses the body as
an instrument. The soul, he argues, develops faculties, such as the
vegetative, the nutritive, the perceptive, when associating with the
body, so that it can carry out the functions of an animated body
(<em>De virtute morali</em> 442B, 450E, 451A, <em>Plat. Q</em>.
107E&ndash;1009B; Karamanolis 2006, 111&ndash;113, Baltes 2000).</p>

<p>
Plutarch maintains the partition of the soul in a rational and a
non-rational part, which is further divided into the spirited and the
appetitive part (<em>De virtute morali</em> 442A&ndash;C,
443B&ndash;C), following in this regard Plato and also Aristotle, whom
he explicitly mentions in this connection (ibid. 442B; see also next
section). In his view, the rational part of the human soul is not
subject to corruption (<em>De genio Socratis</em> 591D&ndash;F) and it
qualifies as one&rsquo;s true self. He argues that our self is neither
that in virtue of which we perceive nor that in virtue of which we
desire, but rather that in virtue of which we reason and think (<em>De
facie</em> 944F&ndash;945A; cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 90a&ndash;d).
Plutarch actually goes so far as to distinguish two kinds of death,
first when our intellect leaves soul and body, second when soul leaves
the body (<em>De facie</em> 943A&ndash;B; see Donini 1988b,
140&ndash;143, Brenk 1994, 15; cf. <em>Porphyry</em> Sent. 9,
<em>Phaedo</em> 64c). The separation of intellect from soul and body
happens &ldquo;by love for the image of the sun&hellip;for which all
nature strives&rdquo; (<em>De facie</em> 944E). The ascent to the sun
as the goal of intellect symbolizes the human being&rsquo;s imitation
of, and assimilation to, the divine, and is a frequent theme in
Plutarch (<em>De Iside</em> 372D&ndash;E, <em>De E</em> 393D&ndash;F,
<em>De sera</em> 556D; see Brenk 1994, 10&ndash;14, Becchi 1997). This
is illustrated in the myth presented in <em>On Delays in Divine
Punishment</em> of a certain Aridaeus, who like Er in the
<em>Republic</em>, died but has come back to life to narrate his
experience after death. The death of Aridaeus amounts to the fall of
the intelligent part of his soul (<em>to phronoun</em>; <em>De
sera</em> 563E&ndash;F, 566A), through which humans partake of the
divine (564C), with the soul remaining behind (<em>all&ecirc;
psych&ecirc;</em>) as an anchor in the body (564C; cf. 560C&ndash;D).
The latter is the non-rational part of the soul, which is such because
it is bound to the body (<em>s&ocirc;matoeid&ecirc;s</em>; 566A) and
inclines the entire soul toward earthly concerns, preventing it from
going very far away (566D).</p>

<p>
This is very similar to what Plotinus maintains later in <em>Enn.</em>
IV.8.8.1. However, in his <em>On the Soul</em>, a work that is only
fragmentarily preserved, Plutarch speaks of the separation of soul
from body and recounts the story of a certain Antyllos who had died
and then his soul had been released again (fr. 176 Sandbach). In this
context Plutarch claims that the doctrine of the incorruptibility of
the soul is an ancient one (fr. 177 Sandbach), a claim which may well
be a criticism of the Epicurean doctrine of the mortality of soul (cf.
<em>Non posse suaviter vivi</em> 1103F; see Bonazzi 2010,
78&ndash;83). Inspired by the <em>Phaedo</em>, Plutarch argues that
the very task of philosophy is to prepare us for the separation from
the body, which amounts to a life without bodily needs that he
considers as the &ldquo;true life&rdquo;, which in his view the
Epicureans ignore (<em>Non posse suaviter vivi</em> 1105C&ndash;E).
After death, Plutarch claims, souls go through the process of
reincarnation, which, as in Plato, is a form of punishment for wicked
souls (<em>De sera</em> 567D&ndash;F). While all intellects live
eternally, those of noble souls become divine (<em>daimones</em>) and
operate as guardians of humans (<em>De genio Socratis</em>
593D&ndash;594A; see further Dillon 1977, 219&ndash;224). Such
evidence suggests that for Plutarch both intellect and soul are
immortal though in a different way, a doctrine we find also later in
Porphyry (fr. 453 Smith).</p>

<h2><a name="EthPol">6. Ethics and Politics</a></h2>

<p>
Plutarch shares the view of Hellenistic philosophers that philosophy
is a way of life. He is much concerned to advocate the happy life
according to Plato, and to show that such life is possible and indeed
happy (<em>Adv. Col</em>. 1107E, <em>Non posse suaviter vivi</em>
1086C&ndash;D). He criticizes both Stoics and Epicureans for proposing
misguided ethical ideals (e.g. <em>De virtute morali</em>
447C&ndash;450D, <em>An recte dictum sit latenter esse vivendum</em>
1129F&ndash;1130E, <em>Adv. Col.</em> 1124E&ndash;1127C; cf. Kechagia
2011, 157&ndash;160). Plutarch&rsquo;s strong concern with ethics is
reflected also in his <em>Lives</em>, each of which focuses on the
character of a historical figure. Central to the <em>Lives</em> is the
issue of how one&rsquo;s nature (<em>physis</em>) can be educated, so
that a certain state of character may be formed (<em>&ecirc;thos;
Pericles</em> 38, <em>Alcibiades</em> 2.1, <em>De sera</em>
551E&ndash;F, 552C&ndash;D; Russell 1973, 105&ndash;106, 117).
Plutarch&rsquo;s especially strong interest in ethics among the
sub-fields of philosophy is characteristic of his age. The two most
prominent of Plutarch&rsquo;s Stoic contemporaries or
near-contemporaries, Epictetus and Seneca, devote most of their
attention in their writings to ethics, and this is the case also with
the Peripatetic Aristocles of Messene (1<sup>st</sup> - 2nd c. CE?),
the author of some eight books on ethics (Suda <em>s.v</em>.
Aristocles). To some extent, this especially strong interest in ethics
goes back to Antiochus (1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE). Antiochus, Plutarch,
and the Peripatetic Aristocles alike identify ethical formation as the
ultimate goal of philosophy, but Plutarch differs from Antiochus in
that he founds his ethics on metaphysics, largely drawing from his
interpretation of the <em>Timaeus</em> outlined above (section
4.1).</p>

<p>
Plutarch rejects the ethics of both Stoics and Epicureans first
because they deny the existence of the intelligible realm, which for
him as a Platonist shapes the sensible world including humans. On the
basis of the <em>Phaedrus</em> and the <em>Timaeus</em>, Plutarch
maintains that both the human intellect and the human soul stem from
the intelligible realm, the indivisible and the divisible being
respectively (<em>De virtute morali</em> 441E&ndash;442A)<em>.</em> A
second main difference between Platonist and Stoic ethics according to
Plutarch lies in their different conception of the soul as source of
human agency (<em>De virtute morali</em> 441C&ndash;E; Babut 1969a.
22&ndash;69, Opsomer 2011, 154&ndash;155). While for the Stoics soul
is reason only, Plutarch defends the conception of soul outlined in
the <em>Republic</em> (esp. book 4), according to which the soul
consists of rational and non-rational parts. The non-rational aspect
of the human soul accounts for emotions and bodily desires (Opsomer
1994, 41); Plutarch, however, does not lump together bodily desires
and emotions as constituting an undifferentiated non-rational part.
Given the theory of <em>Republic</em> 4, he distinguishes spirit, as
responsible for emotions, from appetite, which is responsible for
bodily desires. He classes them together only to the extent that both
can be sensitive to, and nurtured by, reason (<em>De virtute
morali</em> 443C&ndash;D; <em>Plat. Q</em>. 1008A&ndash;B).</p>

<p>
Interestingly, Plutarch does not refer to the <em>Timaeus</em> to
support his theory of the tripartite soul, but rather to Aristotle
(<em>De virtute morali</em> 442B&ndash;C), whom Plutarch, like many
ancient and modern critics, recognizes as adopting essential aspects
of Plato&rsquo;s doctrine (see Karamanolis 2006, 100&ndash;126). The
essential feature that Aristotle shares with Plato is the belief in a
partite soul, composed of rational and non-rational aspects. This
distinction between two aspects of the soul accounts for
unself-controlled, acratic actions, which, Plutarch thinks, prove how
mistaken is the Stoic conception of human agency as deriving from
reason alone. Plutarch describes virtue as the state in which reason
succeeds in managing emotion and driving it in the right direction
(<em>De virtute morali</em> 443B&ndash;D, 444B&ndash;C, 451C&ndash;E),
while vice arises when emotion is not properly informed by reason
(443D). As with the world soul, similarly with the human soul, the
impact of reason produces order and regulation (<em>taxis kai
diakosm&ecirc;sis</em>, <em>De virtute morali</em> 444CD). His
definition of virtue as the state in which emotion is present as
matter and reason as form (440D) is inspired by <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> 1104b13&ndash;30 (cf. Aspasius, <em>In Ethica
Nicomachea</em> 42.20&ndash;25). Plutarch follows Aristotle in
describing virtue as being an extreme of excellence
(<em>akrot&ecirc;s</em>) which lies in a mean (<em>mesot&ecirc;s</em>)
between two opposite emotions (<em>De virtute morali</em>
443D&ndash;444D; <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> 1107a6&ndash;8). Plutarch
argues that there can be no virtue without some emotion; without some
amount of fear, Plutarch contends, there can be no courage, for
instance (<em>De virtute morali</em> 451E&ndash;452A). For courage, he
claims, is the virtue that one acquires when, in a state of fear, one
manages to subordinate fear to a goal set by reason, such as fighting
for one&rsquo;s country; in this sense, emotion is an ally to reason
in constituting virtue (cf. <em>De tranq. animi</em> 471D). This is
specifically the case of anger becoming bravery (<em>De ira</em> fr.
148 Sandbach). Anger, when moderated and guided by reason, can
motivate reasonable and due vengeance (<em>De sera</em> 551A&ndash;B).
Plutarch advocates the Platonic ideal of moderate emotions, against
the Stoic ideal of eradication of emotions/<em>apatheia</em> (<em>De
virtute morali</em> 443D, 451F), which, however, for the
Stoics amounts to eradication of extreme or unreasonable emotions, not
of emotions simpliciter.</p>

<p>
Since virtue is the state (<em>hexis, De virtute morali</em> 443D) in
which emotion is guided by reason, it follows that virtue requires
training and habituation in how to make emotion right (see <em>De
cohibenda ira</em> 459 B&ndash;D). Plutarch devotes an entire treatise
to that subject (<em>De profectibus in virtute</em>). He defends,
against the Stoics, the view that progress in virtue is possible
(ignoring the relevant views of Epictetus, <em>Dissertations</em> I.4
and Seneca, <em>Letters to Lucilius</em> 75.8). Education in virtue
can be provided by parents and teachers, by the example of the
virtuous actions of the people around us (<em>De comm. not.</em>
1069A), by the law of the cities (<em>De virtute morali</em> 452D),
and also by philosophy, poetry and history (<em>De profectibus</em>
79B&ndash;80B). Plutarch tries indeed to offer such an education in
virtue through his writings that have practical orientation, such as
<em>On the Control of Anger, On Curiosity, How Could you Tell a
Flatterer from a Friend, Precepts of Marriage, To an Uneducated
Ruler</em> (see Van Hoof 2010), which are similar in spirit to the
works of Philodemus <em>On Property Management, On the Good Ruler
according to Homer</em> and Seneca&rsquo;s <em>Letters to
Lucilius</em> (see Nikolaidis 2011). Plutarch maintains that the
domination of reason over emotion should be thorough (<em>De cohibenda
ira</em> 459B&ndash;460B), which is why he claims that the temperate
person is less virtuous than the practically wise one
(<em>phronimos</em>), who does the good without wavering as a
temperate person might (<em>De virtute morali</em> 445C&ndash;D; cf.
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> 1151b23&ndash;1152a3). To the extent that
virtue reflects the operation of reason in the human soul, which is
capable of following reason, virtue, Plutarch argues, is natural to
us. He argues in particular that nature itself attracts us
(<em>oikeiousa</em>) to things which are natural for us to strive for,
but these include also life, health, beauty, which Plutarch considers
as completing happiness (<em>sympl&ecirc;rotika, De comm. not.</em>
1060B&ndash;E). Like Cicero in <em>De finibus</em>
III&ndash;IV, Plutarch censures the Stoics because they argue
that the final human end is to live in accordance with nature, but, he
claims, they finally contradict themselves when they admit only virtue
as being good, neglecting all other things which are, by
everyone&rsquo;s admission, good for us, such as health. Plutarch,
like Antiochus, maintains that the human final end includes the
satisfaction of primary demands of the body, a doctrine Plutarch finds
in Aristotle, Xenocrates, and Polemo (<em>De comm. not.</em>
1069E&ndash;F).</p>

<p>
This, however, is not the only conception of happiness that Plutarch
advocates. While he argues against the Stoics that a life devoid of
all emotions cannot be happy, but rather emotions only need to be
moderated or soothed by reason (<em>De tranq. an.</em> 365AC), he also
appears to suggest an alternative end for human life, which consists
in a life of <em>theoria</em>, that is, of thinking, as Aristotle
suggests in <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> X. Plutarch speaks of
<em>epopteia</em>, a religious term referring to the final vision
achieved in initiation ceremonies for mystery religions (<em>De
Iside</em> 382D&ndash;E; cf. <em>Quaestiones Convivales</em> 718d). He
argues that both Plato and Aristotle value the <em>epoptikon</em> part
of philosophy, which consists in the contemplation of the
intelligibles and gives us access to &ldquo;pure truth&rdquo; (<em>De
Iside</em> 382D&ndash;E). In what follows in <em>De Iside</em>
(382F&ndash;383A), Plutarch claims that the souls when they set free
become engaged &ldquo;in insatiable contemplation&rdquo;. Elsewhere
Plutarch advocates for human beings a life similar to God
(<em>exhomoi&ocirc;sis</em>; <em>De sera</em> 550D&ndash;E), but as
Plutarch argues there, it is a life of virtue that makes us similar to
God (apparently referring to <em>Theaetetus</em> 176E and
<em>Republic</em> 613AB). Several eschatological stories found in
Plutarch&rsquo;s work suggest that a human being can transcend the
sensible world and become united with the divine (see Alt 1993,
185&ndash;204). This doctrine is again to be understood against
Plutarch&rsquo;s interpretation of the cosmogony of the
<em>Timaeus</em>. The &ldquo;younger gods&rdquo; of the
<em>Timaeus</em> imitate the demiurge in constructing human
beings&rsquo; and the other animals&rsquo; bodies and souls
(40b&ndash;d, 42e), and this is also the case with nature, which
strives to imitate the creator and become like him (<em>De facie</em>
944; Helmig 2005, 21&ndash;23). Humans are invited to follow the
cosmic example and in this sense live in accordance with nature too.
To achieve this, one should let one&rsquo;s intellect rule, either by
dominating over and soothing emotions or by exercising intellectual
virtue (see <em>Non posse suaviter vivi</em> 1092E). If this is the
case, Plutarch anticipates Plotinus&rsquo; distinction of two kinds of
ethical life, a political and a theoretical one. For Plutarch,
however, the theoretical ideal of the philosopher involves a political
dimension too, which is to help their fellow citizens and the city
with reasoning, as is suggested in the <em>Republic</em>, and he
criticizes Stoics and Epicureans for refusing to engage in politics
(<em>De Stoic. rep.</em> 1033A&ndash;1034C, <em>Adv. Col.</em>
1126B&ndash;1127E, <em>Ad Princ. Inerud.</em> 780C&ndash;F). Plutarch
also relies largely on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
with regard to the nature of virtue. Plutarch&rsquo;s definition of
virtue echoes his account of how the world came into being, when
matter was informed by reason.</p>

<h2><a name="PoeEduThe">7. Poetics and Educational theory</a></h2>

<p>
Given Plutarch&rsquo;s concern for the development of the right
character and the education of the city as a whole, it is hardly
surprising that he wrote works on education (<em>On the Education of
Children, De liberis educandis</em>, which is considered spurious,
however, by Ziegler 1951, 809&ndash;812) and on the effect that poetry
has on the education of one&rsquo;s character. His most important work
in this field is <em>On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets</em>
(<em>Quomodo adolscens poetas audire debeat; De aud. poet.</em>),
while he also wrote a treatise on Homer (<em>De Homero</em>) that is
no longer extant. In the former work Plutarch deals with the question
of how young people should read and understand poetry, since poetry
can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on its interpretation.
Following the <em>Republic</em>, Plutarch argues that poetry is a
mimetic art; it imitates the character and lives of various people,
good and bad alike (<em>De aud. poet</em>. 17E&ndash;F, 26A). In the
course of this, Plutarch claims, poets often tell lies and present
obscene stories and images (ibid. 16A). Plutarch selects examples of
such poetic habits mainly from the <em>Republic</em>, focusing on
stories from Homer in particular. Plutarch does not condemn poetry
altogether; he rather finds a convenient middle solution. He tries to
show how one should read the poets in the most beneficial way. In
order to do so, Plutarch argues, first one should avoid reading the
deliberate lies made in poetry, which can unnecessarily upset one
(ibid. 17B; see Russell 1989, 303). Second, he recommends that the
reader, especially the young one, should learn how to read poetry
allegorically, in such a way that this can have a beneficial effect on
one&rsquo;s character (ibid. 19E&ndash;20B; see Lamberton 2001,
48&ndash;50). This is the approach that Plutarch himself applies to
the myth of Isis and Osiris in his work with that title. Plutarch
illustrates the search for the correct (morally uplifting) meaning of
a poetic saying also in parts of the <em>Table Talks</em>
(<em>Quaestiones Conviviales</em> 622C, 673C; see Russell 1989, 305).
The young man needs to learn the skill of how to recover and isolate
the beneficial elements of poetry and absorb them alone. In that way
poetry can guide one to virtue (ibid. 28E&ndash;F). Plutarch likens
properly educated young men in their attitude towards poetry to the
way bees select the best from flowers (32E), a simile adopted by the
Christians, Basil (<em>To young men on the right use of
literature</em> 4.7&ndash;8), and Gregory of Nazianzus
(<em>Orationes</em> 43.13.1). Such a use of poetry, Plutarch claims,
prepares youths for their education in philosophy (<em>De aud.
poet</em>. 15F, 37B). This happens in two ways. First, poetry can
guide youths towards philosophy by familiarizing them with the
concepts that philosophers use; second, poetry, when properly used,
can guide to virtue, and this, Plutarch argues, is a requirement for
philosophical education (<em>De aud. poet</em>. 36D&ndash;37B).
Plutarch actually maintains that the best of poetry is nothing other
than philosophy in disguise (ibid. 15F), and throughout his work he
tries to illustrate precisely this through a selection of verses from
the most well known ancient poets. In <em>On Making Progress in
Virtue</em> (79B&ndash;D) Plutarch goes so far as to treat poetry and
history as complementary to philosophy in educating the youth.
Regarding the educative role of poetry, he appears to be influenced by
the Stoics, who were using poetry in education, but he goes further
than they did in devising specific strategies meant to turn young men
into good readers of poetry (see Blank 2011).</p>

<p>
From this point of view, one may relate Plutarch&rsquo;s
<em>Lives</em> to his philosophical works (see Gill 2006,
421&ndash;424). Plutarch himself says that he wrote the <em>Lives</em>
for the improvement of others, assuming that the virtuous actions he
describes will instigate emulation in the reader (<em>Pericles</em>
1&ndash;2; see Russell 1973, 100&ndash;101). The Lives of Dion and
Brutus, for instance, place much emphasis on the role of education.
More precisely, in them Plutarch discusses how education and right
upbringing increases one&rsquo;s chances to become virtuous.
Dion&rsquo;s association with Plato, for instance, shaped his mind and
character and paved the way for a virtuous, happy, life (see Opsomer
2011, 159&ndash;168). Perhaps, then, the <em>Lives</em> also aim to
train the reader&rsquo;s character or inspire them to virtue, and in
such a way to prepare them for the life of philosophy. If this is the
case, then the <em>Lives</em> complement those ethical works of
practical orientation that have been discussed in the previous section
(see further Martin 2011).</p>

<h2><a name="Inf">8. Influence</a></h2>

<p>
Plutarch exercised considerable influence on later Platonism. He not
only set, at least in part, the philosophical agenda for later
Platonists by redirecting their attention to the <em>Timaeus</em>, but
he was also influential in terms of his interpretative strategy in
approaching Plato&rsquo;s writings, which aspired to take into account
Plato&rsquo;s entire work and to treat it as a system still to be
articulated, without, however, rejecting the dialectical dimension of
Plato&rsquo;s work. It is this strategy that leads Plutarch to
distinguish hierarchies of being in Plato&rsquo;s work and also levels
of ethical life presented in different Platonic dialogues, a strategy
that Plotinus will adopt and develop. Plutarch&rsquo;s literal
interpretation of the <em>Timaeus</em> was highly debated among
Platonists. It was adopted by Atticus, but was resisted by most
others, including Taurus, Plotinus, Porphyry, and Proclus. Later
Platonists criticized Plutarch for a narrow&ndash;minded
interpretation of the <em>Timaeus.</em> Some of their criticisms (e.g.
on the world soul), however, rest on an uncharitable interpretation of
his positions (see Opsomer 2001). Nevertheless, Plutarch&rsquo;s view
that the world soul is created in the sense that it partakes of reason
and intelligence imparted to it by the demiurge, is endorsed by
Alcinous, <em>Didascalikos</em> 169.33&ndash;42 and presumably also by
Numenius (fr. 45 Des Places; see Dillon 1993, 127). Plutarch&rsquo;s
radical metaphysical and psychological dualism is shared by Numenius
and especially Atticus, but is rejected by Plotinus and Porphyry. The
latter, however, draws on Plutarch in his argument that animals
partake of reason (<em>De abstinentia</em> 3.6&ndash;7).
Plutarch&rsquo;s theory of divine providence and theodicy, as
presented in his <em>On Delays of the Divine Providence</em> (<em>De
sera numinis vindicta</em>) was influential among ancient Platonists
and Christians alike. Proclus, for instance, took over much from it in
his <em>Ten Objections Against Divine Providence</em> (esp. 8 and
9).</p>

<p>
Plutarch was highly influential among early Christians, who approved
of his literal interpretation of the <em>Timaeus</em>, of his theory
of good and bad demons, and of his educational theory. His work was
used by Clement of Alexandria, who followed Plutarch in writing a
treatise with the title &ldquo;Stromateis,&rdquo; but also by
Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria and the Cappadocean Church Fathers,
especially Basil (see above, section 7). An interesting example of
Plutarch&rsquo;s impact on Christians is that of Eusebius (<em>Praep.
Ev</em>. XI.10.15&ndash;16), who compares Ammonius&rsquo; explanation
of the inscription &ldquo;thou art&rdquo; (<em>ei</em>) that addresses
the Delphic God with God&rsquo;s self&ndash;revelation in the Exodus
3:14 who claims that he is the one that is (<em>ho &ocirc;n</em>; see
Opsomer 2023, 83).</p>

<p>
Plutarch was much appreciated in the Italian Renaissance. Italian
humanism of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries has been
named the &ldquo;Plutarchean Age&rdquo; (Weiss 1977, 226). Coluccio
Salutati (1331&ndash;1406) was the first to translate the
<em>Lives</em> in Latin, a translation praised by Chrysoloras, who
used much Plutarch in his teaching of Greek. References to Plutarch in
humanists&rsquo; letters abound at the time, while more and more
translations of Plutarch&rsquo;s works, especially of the
<em>Lives</em>, are made. Florence around 1430 became indeed a center
for the study of Plutarch by humanists close to the Medici, with a
whole series of translations being made dedicated to the Medici.
Humanists apparently appreciated both Plutarch&rsquo;s style and his
educational ideal; they imitated his biographies and were also
inspired by his effort to educate the youth through historical
examples and through advice on the right use of poetry (see Pade 2023,
331&ndash;338).</p>
