<p>
The importance of Albert the Great in the development and achievements
of medieval and more generally Western philosophy remains somewhat
undervalued and understated. For a long time, a shadow was cast onto
his contributions by the excellence of his most famous student, Thomas
Aquinas, whose greater clarity and more systematic thought in
comparison with his master are impossible to deny. But as Aristotle
would never have been the philosopher he was had it not been for
Plato, so too would Aquinas never have reached the heights he did had
it not been for pioneers like Albert. For Albert comes at a time in
the Middle Ages that is intellectually both extraordinarily
stimulating and challenging. Over just a few decades, a trove of new
Greek and Arabic writings in philosophy, mathematics, astronomy,
medicine, etc., makes its way into Western Europe and needs to be
interpreted within a coherent understanding of the world. Not only are
most of those works of the highest caliber, their sophistication and
advancement are often far superior to what medievals had managed on
their own in the many centuries during which the West was cut off from
a significant portion of the intellectual accomplishments of the
Ancient Greeks and later their Arabic successors. Albert is at the
vanguard of that very intense movement of interpretation and
assimilation, which depends on translations (or successive
translations) that not unfrequently contain barely intelligible
passages and which must contribute to one consistent vision of reality
that also minimally does not contradict the Christian faith. The task
is absolutely colossal, and it is thanks to intellectually courageous
giants like Albert that the West manages to accomplish it over a
surprisingly short period of time.</p>

<p>
It would be quite wrong, however, to reduce Albert to the role he
historically played in philosophy or even to being a mere precursor of
Aquinas. For he himself is also an extremely serious and intelligent
thinker, whose writings offer valuable insights into both the thought
of the authors they are commenting on and reality. In other words, he
is a philosopher from whom much can be learned. His seemingly
unquenchable and universal sense of wonder, his tendency to always
look for the deepest and most explanatory reasons, his far above
average capacity to get hold of, read and assimilate new materials,
his ease when dealing with very abstract questions and his general
trust in the power of reason are among his exceptional strengths. As
anyone acquainted with his works knows, however, their study also
comes with difficulties. Albert&rsquo;s verbosity, his seeming desire
to show how well read he is, his at times idiosyncratic Latin and his
contradictions (whether real or only apparent) can easily make him
hard to understand or get in the way of the points he is making. Some
of these weaknesses are assuredly amplified by his role as a pioneer
in the exploration and assimilation of so many new and challenging
sources of different origins, which also manifests itself in the
extraordinary magnitude of his own literary production. (When
completed, the critical edition of his works, begun in the 1950s,
should have more than 40 large volumes, many of which are in fact
groups of volumes.) Even an admirer of his sometimes gets the
impression that it would have been better had he written fewer books
and for that reason perhaps written them a little more slowly and with
greater care.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Albert was born in Lauingen (Swabia), around 1200, to a noble family
at the service of the Count of Bollst&auml;dt. He likely studied at
the Faculty of Arts of the University of Padua, where he became a
Dominican in 1223. He continued his studies in Cologne and
subsequently lectured in convents in Hildesheim, Freiburg im Breisgau,
Regensburg and Strasbourg. In the early 1240s, he was sent to the
University of Paris, where he received his degree of Master of
Theology in 1245 and taught until 1248. He was then sent to Cologne to
found a new Dominican school (<em>studium generale</em>), accompanied
by the young Italian student he had met in 1245 and taught in Paris,
Thomas Aquinas. He led and lectured in the Cologne <em>studium</em>
until 1254, when he was elected by his fellow Dominicans Prior
Provincial of Teutonia. He occupied the position for three years,
during and after which he spent time at Papal courts. Following a new
period of teaching and writing in Cologne, and against the strong
wishes of the head of his order, Albert accepted the troubled
bishopric of Regensburg in 1260. He was granted his request to be
relieved of his position in 1262, and thereafter preached the crusade
in German-speaking regions of Europe. After teaching in W&uuml;rzburg
and Strasbourg (1264&ndash;1269), he was back in Cologne for good,
where he died in 1280. In 1931, Pope Pius XI declared Albert a Saint
and a Doctor of the Church, and ten years later he was made the patron
saint of natural scientists by Pius XII. His remains can be found
today in the crypt of the Dominican church of St. Andreas, in
Cologne.</p>

<p>
Albert&rsquo;s exceptionally prolific writing spanned over many
decades. His first published work, <em>On the Nature of the Good</em>
(<em>De natura boni</em>), dates from the first half of the 1230s and
in his old age he was still working on his <em>Summa of Theology</em>
(<em>Summa theologiae siue de mirabilia scientia Dei</em>), which was
left unfinished despite the fact that some anonymous hands might have
contributed to the composition of its Book II. Many of Albert&rsquo;s
purely philosophical works are from the 1250s, but the late 1240s and
the 1260s were also particularly fertile, both theologically and
philosophically.</p>

<h2 id="MeanAlbePhilWork">2. Meaning of Albert&rsquo;s Philosophical Work</h2>

<p>
As befits the encyclopedia for which this entry is written, we focus
all our attention on Albert&rsquo;s philosophical thought and leave
aside his contribution to the study of Scripture and the development
of Christian revealed theology. (It is interesting to note, in that
respect, that this Dominican friar, Master of Theology at the
University of Paris and bishop was already in the Middle Ages much
more renowned as a philosopher than as a theologian [Grabmann 1917].)
Now, perfect agreement among scholars is lacking when it comes to
determining the exact and complete reason why Albert not only
incorporated many philosophical developments into his theological work
but also devoted so much time and energy on preparing and writing
philosophical books. His own and most oft-quoted statement about the
nature of that work can be found at the very beginning of his
<em>Physica</em>, the first of his numerous paraphrastic commentaries
on Aristotle, written in 1251&ndash;1252:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Our intention, in natural science, is to satisfy as much as we can the
brothers of our order who have been asking us, for now many years, to
compose for them a book on physics like this one, in which they might
acquire a complete knowledge of natural science and on the basis of
which they might be able to understand properly the books of
Aristotle. We do not see ourselves as sufficient to the task, but
being unable to fail the brothers&rsquo; requests and after refusing
many times, we have at last consented to it and undertaken it,
overcome by the requests of some of them. Our goal is primarily to
praise God almighty, who is the source of wisdom and the creator,
master and ruler of nature, and to be useful to the brothers and
consequently to all who read that book and want to acquire natural
science.</p>

<p>
Our method in this work will be to follow Aristotle&rsquo;s order and
meaning and to say whatever seems necessary to explain and support it,
in such a way, however, that no mention is made of his text. Besides
that, we will make digressions, shedding light on difficulties that
arise and providing all the things that, being less explicit in the
meaning of Aristotle, are obscure to some. (&hellip;) [W]herever
(&hellip;) a digression is made, we add it there in order to complete
and support what has been introduced. Proceeding this way, we will
complete as many books and use the same titles as Aristotle did. We
will also add book parts where they have not been completed and books
where they have been skipped or omitted, which books either Aristotle
did not make or, if he perhaps made them, they have not come down to
us. (&hellip;)</p>

<p>
Now, since there are three essential parts to the philosophy of
reality (&hellip;), which are the natural (or physical), mathematical
and metaphysical parts, our intention is to render said parts
intelligible to the Latins. (&hellip;) [W]hile treating the parts of
philosophy, we will first complete, with God&rsquo;s help, natural
science, and then we&rsquo;ll speak of all the mathematical ones and
it is in divine science [i.e., metaphysics] that what we intend to do
will come to its end. (<em>Physica</em>, I, 1, 1, p.1, l.9&ndash;49
and p.3, l.37&ndash;41)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Albert&rsquo;s goal of writing paraphrastic commentaries on all of
Aristotle&rsquo;s natural works and to make them intelligible to his
Dominican brothers and contemporaries quickly turns out to be much
more ambitious, first because it also extends to mathematics and
metaphysics. Not only will all available works by Aristotle be
explained and added to, but works written by other philosophers will
be incorporated into the project along the way, whether it be to fill
in a few noticeable gaps in Aristotle&rsquo;s writings, as in natural
science, to dramatically expand on what he has left us, as in
metaphysics, or to actually deal with a branch of learning about which
he seems not to have written anything, as in mathematics. Moreover,
the actual unfolding of Albert&rsquo;s project over the years reveals
very early on that he has the same plan in mind for the other two main
parts of philosophy, logic and ethics. In fact, at the time of
establishing and describing the above plan he was finishing or had
recently finished a question-commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and he was months or a few years away from
composing the first of a long list of commentaries on logic.</p>

<p>
But why is Albert embarking on such a demanding and ambitious
enterprise, for which there is no precedent in the Middle Ages? It is
almost natural for modern historians of philosophy to think that he is
simply interested in what Aristotle (or in some cases, another
like-minded philosopher) thought and wants to help less advanced
students who share the same interest. Albert&rsquo;s numerous explicit
denials in his commentaries that he is putting forth what he himself
thinks and his claims that he is merely exposing others&rsquo; ideas
and that readers unhappy with the latter should not lay the blame at
his door seem to confirm that interpretation. On this depends the
principle held by some (and explicitly encouraged in <em>De somni et
vigilia</em>, III, 1, 12, p.195b) that Albert&rsquo;s personal views
are to be found only in his theological works, especially the
theological syntheses, and never in his purely philosophical
commentaries. However tempting such an approach may be, it is perhaps
too easy or simplistic to be true and it is telling that very few
today consistently adopt it. First, Albert sees Aristotle as the
greatest authority in philosophical matters, comparable to Augustine
in revealed theology, which in the context means that Aristotle is
more right about more things and that he is not studied merely out of
curiosity or because his works have relatively recently resurfaced and
become fashionable in the West. Much of what Albert says when
expounding Aristotle, in particular when raising and answering
objections against him, would make little sense if he were not
constantly reading and most often agreeing with Aristotle in light of
what reason and experience tell him about reality. Moreover, and
consequently, all those thinkers that Albert lumps with Aristotle
under the wide (and sometimes elastic) label of &ldquo;Peripatetic
school&rdquo; &mdash; Avicenna, Averroes, Porphyry, the author of the
<em>Book of Causes</em>, etc. &mdash; are used to explain, complete
and add to Aristotle because a great number of their claims are
considered by Albert to be not only consistent with what the Stagirite
says, but also true. Also, there are, as previously mentioned,
discrepancies within Albert&rsquo;s works, but it is far from being
clear that those that come to light when comparing his theological
with his philosophical works are proportionally more numerous or
important than those that come out when we compare his philosophical
writings with one another or his earlier writings with later ones. The
rich philosophical developments that can be found in his theological
works are also, much more often than not, in agreement with either the
totality or a part of what he says in his exclusively philosophical
writings. Finally, a good proportion of Albert&rsquo;s disclaimers,
however general their terms, arise in the context of discussions of
philosophical matters about which stakes and risks of contradicting,
directly or indirectly, church doctrine are particularly high (e.g.
God&rsquo;s causality), or he seems to struggle mightily to make up
his mind for good (e.g. the animation of celestial bodies and the
identification of those spirits with angels) (Twetten and Baldner
2013: 171).</p>

<p>
Everything considered, then, is Albert a systematic thinker? Does the
sum of his writings present a new, unified, structured and entirely or
almost entirely consistent understanding of reality? No, especially if
we take people like Aquinas or Scotus as the measures of such
systematicity. Perhaps we should say that Albert is indeed a
systematic philosopher, but in a diluted sense and only in as much as
one can be when one is attempting to absorb a wave of new knowledge
that vastly surpasses what Europe had been able to achieve without it;
when one is most often one of the first or not rarely even the first
in the West to work and comment on the books or groups of books that
convey that resurging ancient wisdom; when one often comments on a
work before one has had a chance to access or study seriously other
relevant parts of that new corpus or more legible translations
thereof; and when one&rsquo;s somewhat bulimic mind and very universal
interests lead one to write a little too much and too fast. In fact,
that Albert managed to be as consistent or systematic as he was under
such circumstances is perhaps what should amaze us, rather than the
lack of unity we notice between the different parts of his works.</p>

<p>
If something approaching a loose philosophical system can be seen in
Albert&rsquo;s project, even one that would have formed only along the
way, what would be some of its main features or how should it be
characterized? On the one hand, Albert&rsquo;s understanding of
philosophy proper as a rational pursuit of understanding of reality,
his genuine and keen interest in the workings of the physical world,
his constant respect for and desire to be in agreement with empirical
evidence and the rules of logic, as well as his explicit and repeated
claims that Aristotle is the main thinker he is following in
philosophy, clearly point toward Aristotelianism. Albert explains and
writes commentaries on Aristotle more than on any other philosopher,
and it shows in the fact that Aristotle is the immediate source of the
greatest proportion of Albert&rsquo;s ideas in philosophy. And yet
many feel ill at ease labelling him an Aristotelian, one reason being
that most moderns do not share Albert&rsquo;s syncretic conviction,
rooted in late Antiquity and fairly common in the Middle Ages, that
much of what he finds in and retrieves from his other sources &mdash;
whether Ancient Greek, Arabic or Jewish &mdash; can be shown to
complement and be compatible with an Aristotelian comprehension of the
universe. More importantly, the materials that he finds in his
Neoplatonic readings and attaches to his Aristotelian project tend to
play a quantitatively disproportionate role in his loose synthesis
because they concern extremely fundamental questions about which
Aristotle says very little, particularly God and the created
world&rsquo;s relationship to Him as its cause. In that respect the
influence on Albert of Pseudo-Dionysius (on whose whole corpus he
wrote commentaries before embarking on his series of Aristotelian
paraphrases) and the anonymous <em>Book of Causes</em> (which Albert
thought had its origin in Aristotle but was in reality an Arabic
reworking of Proclus&rsquo; <em>Elements of Theology</em>) can hardly
be overemphasized. It is in light of that influence that it has been
argued (Anzulewicz 2000a and 2000b) that there is a general but
profound underlying unity to Albert&rsquo;s whole project and that it
is provided by his adhesion to the triad
<em>exitus</em>-<em>perfectio</em>-<em>reductio</em>: 1) the
procession of the world from God, its one and simple creator and
exemplar (<em>exitus</em>), 2) the world&rsquo;s concrete unfolding
and realization in multiplicity, contingency, potentiality, time and
materiality (<em>perfectio</em>); 3) the return and reduction of all
created things to God, their ultimate end (<em>reductio</em>). Much of
the work done by Aristotle and his followers, in which among other
things the concept of creation <em>ex nihilo</em> is seemingly absent
and the permanence of prime matter often treated as given, is then
seen as only one part of a bigger whole and as focusing mostly on the
description and analysis of <em>perfectio</em>, i.e. our world as it
concretely realizes itself and is experienced by us. Said work also
ceases to be seen as incompatible or in unacceptable tension with the
Neoplatonic intuitions and Christian faith of Pseudo-Dionysius and the
highly abstract metaphysical reasoning of the <em>Book of Causes</em>,
which concentrate on God as the prime origin and ultimate end of
absolutely all things that constitute our world. Not everyone is
convinced by such attempts, however, and the remark has been made
(Sturlese 2017: 875&ndash;876) that given the lack of unity between
Albert&rsquo;s works and the changes in his thought over time, it is
best to study and treat each book in relation to its own unique
context and in chronological order.</p>

<h2 id="Logi">3. Logic</h2>

<p>
Logic is for Albert a full-fledged science in the Aristotelian sense,
with self-evident principles which are specific to it (e.g.
&lsquo;when something is predicated of a subject, that which is said
of the predicate is also said of the subject&rsquo;) and from which
necessary conclusions can be drawn. It is also an art in a broad sense
in as much as the elements of that scientific, theoretical knowledge
can be used as rules in the concrete reasoning done in all sciences
(including in logic), thus justifying the traditional view of logic as
the instrument or mode of the sciences (Tremblay 2007).</p>

<p>
Albert was the first in the Middle Ages to comment on the whole of
Aristotle&rsquo;s organon, as well as a few complementary works that
tradition had attached to the latter over time. The texts he commented
on are ordered by him in function of, by and large, the main cognitive
ends that the application of logical knowledge can contribute to: 1)
knowing the incomplex, i.e. knowing the quiddity of things, ultimately
and ideally through definition (Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em>,
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, the anonymous
12<sup>th</sup>-century <em>Book on the Six Principles</em> [which
Albert attributes to Gilbertus Porretanus] and Boethius&rsquo;
<em>Book on Division</em>); 2) knowing the complex, i.e. knowing the
true through simple predication or argumentation (Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>On Interpretation</em>, <em>Prior Analytics</em>, <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>, <em>Topics</em> and <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>,
as well as two short treatises by Boethius on the categorical and the
hypothetical syllogisms). The latter two commentaries by Albert, to
which he refers in <em>Posteriora Analytica</em>, I, 1, 1, p.4a,
appear to be lost.</p>

<p>
Albert&rsquo;s work in logic has received relatively little attention
so far. This is true of other writings of his, but it is also that
some hold Albert&rsquo;s logical corpus in very low esteem (most
famously Prantl 1867; Ebbesen 1981), for which the latest reason is
his undeniably extensive and silent use therein of his predecessor
Robert Kilwardby&rsquo;s commentaries. The reproach should not be
overstated, however, not only because of how common it was for
medievals to anonymously use contemporaries&rsquo; material in
teaching and not to refer to them by name in their writings &mdash;
something which Kilwardby himself does, as shown by the material
common to his logical commentaries and those of his own Parisian
predecessors &mdash; but also because the influence of the English
master is very uneven throughout Albert&rsquo;s logical corpus.
Moreover, it seems to be most present in the more formal or technical
treatises, notably the commentary on the <em>Prior Analytics</em> and
those on <em>On Interpretation</em> and the <em>Sophistical
Refutations</em>, which were likely of lesser interest to Albert. In
his commentary on the <em>Categories</em> and the <em>Second
Analytics</em>, arguably the most crucial of the Aristotelian logical
treatises, Kilwardby is most often used as a rich and reliable source
of common classroom objections and problems and many of his solutions
are either contradicted or greatly developed by Albert (Steel 2009;
Brumberg-Chaumont 2020).</p>

<p>
Logic as understood by Albert and most ancient and medieval
philosophers pays attention to much more than argumentative formal
validity and deals with questions that many today would say belong to
epistemology and even metaphysics. This is certainly not to say that
he confuses logic and metaphysics as he understands them. Albert is an
early promoter in the West of the Avicennian view that logic deals
with something that has only intellectual existence, unlike what
metaphysics and philosophy of nature study (<em>Metaphysica</em>, I,
1, 1, p.3, l.8&ndash;12). More precisely, it examines the features
that the natures of things or real objects of our thoughts take on
when they exist in and are understood by our intellect and enter into
relationships with one another in rational discourse, which is the
process of acquiring new knowledge on the basis of what we already
know. Thus, universals (if understood logically, for Albert can mean
many different things when using that term), supreme genera, subjects,
predicates, contradictories, premises, syllogisms, etc., are examples
of the many topics that logic must study, although the argument or the
syllogism is also frequently singled out as the subject of the science
of logic because of how it roughly contains or implies the others.
Being a genus, a predicate or part of a premise are traits of things
as conceived, strictly speaking, although like Avicenna, Albert
believes that our need to use linguistic manifestations of our
concepts in order to conduct rational discourse explains why we also,
albeit less properly or essentially, characterize logic as a language
science (Tremblay 2011; 2014).</p>

<p>
Albert&rsquo;s frequent metaphysical, natural and other non-logical
digressions in his logical works do not contradict his debt toward
Avicenna and his clear understanding of the purely rational or
intellectual nature of the type of reality logic studies. They reflect
his general tendency, noticed in most of his works and unnerving to
some of his readers, to be as complete as possible. In the case of
logic, two more reasons are at play. First, Albert thinks that even
though logic is about beings that exist only in reason, what is true
about them depends ultimately on the objective nature of things. Thus,
it is only after it has been abstracted as a universal concept that
<em>animal</em>, when understood in relation to <em>horse</em> in
rational discourse, acquires the logical property of generality and
becomes a genus, but the truth that <em>animal</em> is the logical
genus of <em>horse</em> (or the falsehood that <em>animal</em> is the
logical species or proper accident of <em>horse</em> or that
<em>carrot</em> is the genus of <em>horse</em>) is at the end of the
day based on what those things are in themselves, independently of
reason (<em>Liber divisionum</em>, 2, 4, p.91, l.3&ndash;22; <em>De
anima</em>, III, 3, 2, p.210, l.18&ndash;20; <em>Super Porphyrium De V
universalibus</em>, 1, 2, p.4, l.61&ndash;68; Tremblay 2014). In that
sense, at least some of Albert&rsquo;s non-logical forays have to do
with his desire to bring to light a deeper explanatory reason. Second,
Albert is sometimes commenting on works that contain or are seen by
him as containing non-logical points or developments. Thus, Albert
believes that even if the <em>Categories</em> is overall a work in
logic, some of the properties of the ten categories treated by
Aristotle are non-logical and belong to the supreme genera whether we
know and reason about them or not (<em>De praedicamentis</em>, 2, 6,
p.30, l.64&ndash;31, l.2; 2, 8, p.36, l.46&ndash;51; 2, 9, p.38,
l.53&ndash;55; 2, 12, p.45, l.7&ndash;10; Tremblay 2019).</p>

<h2 id="NatuPhilScie">4. Natural Philosophy and the Sciences</h2>

<p>
For Albert, as well as for most thinkers up to the early modern era,
natural philosophy or science encompasses any study of the physical
world conducted by reason and using sense experience as a decisive
criterion of truth. Its fundamental unity comes from the fact that it
has one general subject, which he defines formally as <em>corpus
mobile</em> or body subject to change (a position Aquinas will later
criticize), whose different kinds are addressed in the more particular
branches of the discipline (<em>Physica</em>, I, 1, 3). The first part
of that study is considered in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> and,
following our narrower modern parlance, we might call it more
philosophical. In physics, we define the subject of the discipline in
all its generality, demonstrate its properties and generally shed
light on an array of very common aspects of the physical world that
relate in one way or another to naturally changeable material
substances as such. Those things &mdash; change, final causality or
telos, body, time, place, etc. &mdash; are so common that no person
normally constituted can fail to experience them and therefore
everyone has some form of knowledge of them. That knowledge comes
first in the study of the physical world, because, being very general,
it is always presupposed by any more specific and particular knowledge
of the world that surrounds us (e.g. my understanding of any kind of
change, such as eclipses or even yesterday&rsquo;s lunar eclipse,
depends on and cannot exist without my understanding of change in
general) and it is also more certain (e.g. that change exists in the
physical world is much more certain than that a meteorite is currently
entering the earth&rsquo;s southern atmosphere at 12.6745327 km/s).
Those very basic and certain notions, manifested by common everyday
experience and in need of no confirmation from more specialized
experience or sciences, initially provide only a confused
understanding. Their exact content and everything it entails have to
be clarified by a purely philosophical analysis. It is by virtue of
that analysis that Albert fully adopts the Aristotelian view that all
physical substances are necessarily made of a potential principle and
an actualizing principle, matter and form, and that these, along with
privation, fully explain change as such and therefore apply to all the
changes bodily substances undergo, including their coming- and
ceasing-to-be. Because of their generality and certainty, hylomorphism
and the other such fundamental notions developed by Aristotle in the
<em>Physics</em> (teleology, for instance) are always taken for
granted and are constantly appealed to in the rest of Albert&rsquo;s
study of the physical world, including in those natural works in which
he is in fact not directly paraphrasing or commenting on
Aristotle.</p>

<p>
The unity of the works associated with the more specific or particular
disciplines that constitute the rest of the study of nature manifests
itself for Albert in the fact that they all deal with mobile body
considered in more specific respects. For example, the topic of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the Heavens</em> is elementary mobile bodies
(ether, fire, water, air and earth) insofar as they undergo change of
place; in his <em>On Generation and Corruption</em> the four sublunar
elements are further studied as being subject to other kinds of
change, whereas in his <em>Meteors</em>, they are considered through
the process of mixing into composite bodies; Albert&rsquo;s <em>On
Minerals</em>, <em>On Plants</em> and <em>On Animals</em> deal with
the genera and species of fully-constituted mixed mobile bodies; and
so on (<em>Physica</em>, I, 1, 4).</p>

<p>
As some of those examples show, the more particular branches of the
study of nature depend much more on specialized observations (e.g.
comets or the behaviour of elephants) that most of us do not make and
must therefore accept by an act of confidence in what the observer
says and on hypotheses and theories (e.g. the five elements or the
indestructibility of ethereal celestial bodies), which makes them more
akin to what we today call the natural sciences than philosophy.
Albert is sometimes described as a medieval forerunner of modern
science, and his great interest in knowing the physical world down to
its smallest and most particular aspects, his belief in the usefulness
of mathematical tools in at least some parts of that study (in
particular in astronomy and optics), his general respect for
experience and his frequent mentions of personal observations and in
some cases even experimental tests (especially about minerals, plants
and animals) certainly lend some support to that claim. But it would
be wrong to think of Albert as someone who, in his more scientific
work, had grasped the extent of the benefits of a generalized
mathematical approach of the natural world and the wall-to-wall
application of the hypothetico-deductive experimental method, which
are two essential features of modern science.</p>

<p>
Following the Aristotelian tradition, Albert first attaches the study
of the soul to natural philosophy, for the reason that the soul is
that which animates certain mobile bodies, i.e. the principle by which
they are alive, and therefore the soul must be understood for living
bodies to be known properly. Now, the soul is a much less general or
encompassing topic than the things that are dealt with in the
<em>Physics</em>, and such particular subjects typically cannot be
treated with the same evidence and certainty because everyday, common
experience offers no or less insight into them. Moreover, the soul
itself and what it does are not, as such, objects of the senses, which
seems to be a problem given that our knowledge begins in sense
perception and the most natural object of our human intellect is the
nature of sensible things. Albert addresses the problem by first
reminding his readers that if our knowledge begins in sense
perception, it does not end there and therefore knowing things that
the senses do not perceive is possible: not only is the nature of
particular sensible things not a direct object of sensation itself
(e.g. strictly speaking we cannot see or smell what a dog essentially
is), but we are even able to conclude, on the basis of our
understanding of the nature and properties of sensible things, a
certain number of things concerning the existence and nature of their
metaphysical causes, which are not sensible at all. More to the point,
finally, there is the fact that our soul, already when dealing with
the sensible and physical things that surround it, necessarily also
experiences itself doing so (<em>De anima</em>, I, 1, 1, p.2,
l.36&ndash;p.3, l.5; III, 2, 15, p.199, l.42&ndash;52; <em>Super
Dionysium De caelesti hierarchia</em>, 2, p.18, l.51&ndash;55). When
we see or hear particular dogs, when we are afraid of them, when we
understand their universal nature, etc., we also experience seeing,
hearing, fearing and understanding, which gives us a formidable access
to our soul and intellect that we do not have when studying the
highest causes of reality. That first, universally available insight
into the nature and operations of the soul is of course as vague as it
is certain, and defining accurately and reaching a distinct
understanding of the soul remains an extremely difficult task for the
philosopher (<em>De anima</em>, I, 1, 3, p.6, l.29&ndash;p.7, l.30).
Well conducted, however, the rational inquiry into its nature and
properties will reveal among other things the universality of the
intellect and our free will (i.e. the intellect can in theory grasps
anything that is and the will can turn itself toward anything that is
grasped as good; see <em>De anima</em>, I, 1, 1, p.2, l.5&ndash;13, and
<em>Liber de principiis motus processivi</em>, 2, 12, p.73, l.47&ndash;50),
from which their immateriality and incorruptibility, and therefore the
immateriality and incorruptibility of the soul of which the intellect
and the will are powers, will be shown, as well as the soul&rsquo;s
subsistence or capacity to exist without a body. Thus, the soul or the
intellect, through which man serves as a kind of nexus between the
material and the immaterial world (<em>Metaphysica</em>, I, 1, 1, p.2,
l.4&ndash;11), can also be considered in itself rather than as the
perfection or principle of the living body. This quickly branches out
of natural philosophy and into metaphysics (<em>De homine</em>, 3.1.1,
p.10, l.59&ndash;67), where the soul or the intellect can be
considered in its intelligible and ontological anteriority over the
material world, as a procession from God and knowing recipient of the
forms emanating from Him &mdash; all things for which Neoplatonic and
non-Aristotelian sources, for instance the <em>Book of Causes</em>,
play a crucial role in shaping Albert&rsquo;s thought. Just as our
soul&rsquo;s experience and knowledge of its acts provide its point of
departure in the science of the soul, the intellect&rsquo;s
understanding of itself is also crucial to the metaphysical
investigation of the highest causes of reality, up to the very First
Cause. These first causes are themselves pure intellects and the root
of the nature, immortality and beauty of our own intellects. The human
intellect&rsquo;s self-knowledge allows it to catch a glimpse of such
higher intellects by analogy (<em>De unitate intellectus</em>, 3a,
&sect;1, p.23, l.28&ndash;44; <em>De IV coaequaevis</em>, 4, 28, 2,
p.496).</p>

<h2 id="Math">5. Mathematics</h2>

<p>
As previously mentioned, part of Albert&rsquo;s initial philosophical
program in the very early 1250s was the writing of books on the
mathematical sciences, among which he seems to have meant to include
at least geometry, astronomy and perhaps even optics
(<em>Physica</em>, I, 2, 1, p.17, l.55&ndash;56; <em>De anima</em>,
II, 3, 16, p.122, l.58&ndash;62 and 16, p.123, l.52&ndash;55; Geyer
1938: 165&ndash;166). However, we possess today only one actual
mathematical work, a seemingly truncated commentary on Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em> that is found in a single manuscript and that after
decades of hesitation most scholars now consider to be Albert&rsquo;s.
Toward the middle of the 1260s, Albert mentions that he can devote
himself to metaphysics, &ldquo;now that the natural sciences and
mathematical (<em>doctrinalibus</em>) sciences have been
explained&rdquo; (<em>Metaphysica</em>, I, 1, 1, p.1, l.9&ndash;10),
and the direct evidence we have that the natural sciences half of that
claim is true certainly adds credibility to its mathematical one. The
loss of some work(s) in astronomy (possibly a commentary on
Ptolemy&rsquo;s <em>Almagest</em>) or another discipline deemed
mathematical is thus likely, albeit unproven. Much of what we can know
of Albert&rsquo;s mathematical thought, in particular his philosophy
of mathematics, is to be found in passages from his extant,
non-mathematical writings.</p>

<p>
Like most in the Middle Ages, Albert identifies quantity as the
subject of mathematics in general, more precisely discrete quantity in
the case of arithmetic (i.e. number theory) and continuous quantity in
that of geometry (<em>Analytica posteriora</em>, I, 2, 13, p.53b).
Quantity being a feature of changeable bodies, the consideration of it
seems to belong to natural philosophy or science, which it assuredly
does (<em>Physica</em>, V, 1, 8, p.418, l.10&ndash;34), and yet that
does not make arithmetic or geometry branches of natural science. The
reason for this is that mathematics considers quantity not as it
exists in the natural world, i.e. as the feature of a material and
changeable subject, but abstractly, i.e. in itself and without the
subject in which it is found in the extra-mental world and without the
traits of this subject. When studying the line, for instance, the
geometer completely ignores the fact that lines in the outside world
exist in faces, wood or chalk, and that such things are also cold,
soft, blue or good and undergo multiple changes. This abstraction is
possible because we can imagine quantity without that in and with
which it always exists outside of our mind, and in that process
quantity acquires or is seen in a perfected form with properties it
does not have when considered in nature. Straight lines in the
physical world are never as perfectly straight and spheres are never
as perfectly spherical as the mathematical definitions say such things
are. Indeed, the abstraction that is typical of mathematics is not
simply the abstraction of the universal from the particular, as when
the natural philosopher abstracts some common nature from the traits
proper to the real individuals in which it exists extra-mentally
(<em>Super Dionysium De divinis nominibus</em>, 1, 10, p.5,
l.23&ndash;37). If we define what an animal is by claiming, say, that
it is a living being endowed with sense perception, this definition
applies perfectly to this or that particular animal, even though it
abstracts from the precise colours, location, size, etc., of each. By
contrast, the geometrical definition of a straight line or a sphere is
only approximately and never perfectly verified in physical
&ldquo;straight&rdquo; lines or &ldquo;spherical&rdquo; figures.
Properties of mathematical beings and their physical counterparts
often differ or are contradictory. For instance, a number as
understood in mathematics can be added to infinitely, whereas the
number of, say, atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water can never be
more than two precisely because of the material it is made of or found
in, and a mathematical body can be divided infinitely or a straight
line as conceived in geometry touch a sphere at only one point, which
bodies and lines existing in physical matter cannot actually do
(<em>Physica</em>, III, 2, 17; <em>De generatione et corruptione</em>,
I, 1, 14, p.123, l.36&ndash;46; <em>De anima</em>, I, 1, 1, p.12,
l.92&ndash;p.13, l.10; <em>Metaphysica</em>, III, 2, 3, p.118,
l.35&ndash;40).</p>

<p>
Natural philosophy, being about natural things as they are found in
the material and changing physical world, must therefore constantly
rely on the testimony of the senses to support one way or another its
claims (either in general or more specifically about the quantitative
aspects of natural things), whereas the mathematician must turn toward
the imagination, in which the individual cases that best embody
mathematical definitions lie (<em>Super Euclidem</em>, prooemium, p.1,
l.3&ndash;18; <em>Physica</em>, III, 2, 17, p.197, l.29&ndash;51).
Extra-mental triangles or numbers are the remote foundation of the
mathematical beings we necessarily form when we conceive of the latter
without matter and motion, and this seems to be enough to make
mathematics a science of the real in some sense and its objects
something classifiable within Aristotle&rsquo;s categories (<em>De
praedicamentis</em>, 3, 3, p.56, l.19&ndash;36). (Albert would
probably heavily qualify such a view if he could see some of the
developments of mathematics in the centuries that separate him from
us.)</p>

<p>
Even though purely metaphysical things &mdash; being as being, for
instance, or the first causes of all things &mdash; do not as such
contain sensible matter or undergo physical change and therefore are
inherently most knowable with certainty, it is much easier and natural
for us as animals or embodied souls to think and feel certain about
things that can be sensorially perceived or imagined. First among such
things are quantitative beings that can be imagined and understood
without matter and motion, which greatly diminish intelligibility
(<em>Ethica</em>, VI, 2, 25, p.443b). This is why disagreements are
much less frequent in mathematics than in metaphysics or even natural
philosophy and why mathematics has always been held in such high
esteem among the disciplines (<em>Super Ethica</em>, VII, 2, 607,
p.521, l.88&ndash;95). The traditional applied branches of
mathematics, mainly astronomy (the geometrical study of the movements
of celestial bodies) and musical theory (the study of the numerical
ratios involved in musical sounds) but also a whole series of
disciplines like optics, engineering and many others, use some of the
conclusions drawn in pure mathematics as tools to know and better
control some parts of the natural world. In as much as they depend on
and apply mathematical knowledge to their subject matter, they are
mathematical, but in as much as the subjects they apply them to are
natural things, they belong to natural science (<em>Physica</em>, II,
1, 8, p.90, l.63&ndash;p.91, l.28). The fact that such mixed
disciplines consider something as existing in matter and subject to
change makes them less clear and certain than pure mathematics, but it
also makes them more honorable as far as their subject matter is
concerned, most obviously in the case of astronomy (<em>De anima</em>,
I, 1, 2, p.3, l.23&ndash;42), which for the ancients and medievals
deals with things that are very high in the universe&rsquo;s causal
ladder and assuredly much higher than abstracted quantities existing
only in our imagination. All in all, Albert appears to be a strong
proponent of the view that mathematical entities are based in natural
beings rather than the other way around (<em>Metaphysica</em>, I, 1,
1, p.2, l.31&ndash;35; Molland 1980).</p>

<h2 id="Meta">6. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
The exact nature of Albert&rsquo;s views on the subject of metaphysics
and in particular the way in which it encompasses or relates to God,
as well as many other metaphysical questions such as the composition
of being or the existence and role of created separate substances, has
been a matter of debate for some time. Such problems are very
difficult in any context, but even more so for an era that was trying
to quickly assimilate recently arrived and fully mature metaphysical
writings of Greek and Arabic origin. Albert led that effort, being the
first known medieval to write a commentary on the totality of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em> and on the anonymous <em>Book
of Causes</em>, and among the first to comment on the highly
metaphysical Pseudo-Dionysian corpus. He did so with the help of
Averroes and Avicenna, whose sometimes divergent readings of the
<em>Metaphysics</em> were both very influential in the West and had to
be grappled with. That Albert&rsquo;s metaphysical thought contains
some confusion or at the very least is unclear or confusing to us is a
serious problem but hardly a scandal.</p>

<p>
Albert sides with the Aristotelian and Avicennian characterisation of
the subject matter of the science of metaphysics as being qua being,
in which God is considered because He is the principle and cause of
being as being (<em>Metaphysica</em>, I, 1, 2; IV, 2, 1). This
consideration is the most important reason one may have to pursue this
kind of study of being, which is why if God were also called the
subject of metaphysics, it would only be in the different sense of its
goal or principal object of consideration (<em>Summa theologiae siue
de mirabilia scientia Dei</em>, I, 1, 3, 1, p.10, l.65&ndash;89).
Whether he always specifies it or not, Albert understands the subject
matter of metaphysics to be created being. This is the being that,
starting with our experience or knowledge of ourselves, the things in
the material and changing universe that surrounds us and even separate
higher causes whose existence he believes we are able to deduce, we
discover through a rational process of abstraction. We isolate and
bring to light the primitive and naturally formed concept of being
that we all have and separate it from any other understood form or
determination. That form of being is by nature and intelligibility
prior to all other things (e.g. as expressions like &ldquo;living
being&rdquo; or &ldquo;human being&rdquo; show), although it is never
found as such as an extra-mental reality. For nothing in our created
world is ever simply being: it is always a being (i.e. this or that
concrete being) and it is also always a being of this or that kind
(e.g. an animal, an intellect, green, etc.) (Tremblay 2019).</p>

<p>
This explicit philosophical process of the analysis and resolution of
all beings into being as being or the form of being will bring
distinction to the vague and confused understanding of being that all
our thinking presupposes. It could for instance be by dividing it into
its most general kinds (actual and potential, necessary and possible,
substantial and accidental, etc.) or by showing that being is a
component of all created beings, in which multiple kinds of
composition are to be found and minimally the composite of
that-which-is (<em>quod est</em>) and being (<em>esse</em>) &mdash; a
composition that for Albert applies to created beings in more than one
sense, which makes the exact meaning of many passages where this
vocabulary is used exceedingly difficult to interpret for his readers.
By and large, this vertical process of resolution into the simplest
form or predicate seems to describe for Albert much of
Aristotle&rsquo;s way of proceeding in his <em>Metaphysics</em>
(<em>Super IV libros Sententiarum</em>, I, 46, 14, p.450a), all the
more so given the Stagirite&rsquo;s preference for naming that form
concretely (<em>ens</em>, in Latin translations), instead of
abstractly (<em>esse</em>).</p>

<p>
Complementary to and compatible with the above approach, in
Albert&rsquo;s eyes, is the Pseudo-Dionysian corpus and the <em>Book
of Causes</em>, more evidently so to him since he wrongly believes the
latter to be of Aristotelian origin. In such Neoplatonic works, the
emphasis is less on slowly and <em>a posteriori</em> retracing our way
back from concrete beings to the general form of being they share
(univocally or analogously), than on considering being directly in its
purity and priority over all other things in the created world and as
the very first and most primary procession or emanation from God.
Created things are of themselves nothing actual, mere possibilities to
be in this or that finite way that God knows by knowing Himself and
some of which He freely understands and wills into existence (<em>De
causis et processu universitatis a prima causa</em>, I, 3, 1; 4, 2,
p.44, l.37&ndash;43). Thus, and whatever intermediary role Albert
ascribes to created separate substances and celestial bodies in the
production of concrete beings of diverse kinds, God is the efficient
and formal (i.e. exemplary) cause of the being that is the subject
matter of metaphysics, as well as its final cause, for in one way or
another created being has an inclination to return to its ultimate
source (<em>Metaphysica</em>, XI, 1, 3, p.462, l.58&ndash;71;
<em>Summa theologiae sive de mirabilia scientia Dei</em>, I, 13, 55,
3).</p>

<p>
What God is in Himself can never be grasped by us. We must instead
resort to 1) relating His effects to Him, as we have just seen; 2)
denying of Him things like the multiple forms of composition or
finiteness that we find everywhere in our world; or 3) realizing that
even if He has to be in some sense a being, a substance, etc. &mdash;
since causes cannot give what they do not have and He is the source
and exemplar of all things that we call and understand to be thus
&mdash; He is those things in such a perfect and unfathomable way that
it is better to simply state that He is beyond being, beyond
substance, etc. (<em>Metaphysica</em>, XI, 2, 7, p.491,
l.74&ndash;p.492, l.5; <em>De causis et processu universitatis a prima
causa</em>, I, 3, 6, p.41, l.28&ndash;52). It goes without saying that
for Albert the above concerns the limits of rationality and
metaphysics as a branch of philosophy. He is also a Christian, a
theologian and a scriptural commentator, and as such he believes that
God has freely revealed a certain number of things about Himself
through history and above all in the Incarnation, but this falls
outside of the purview of this article.</p>

<h2 id="EthiPoli">7. Ethics and Politics</h2>

<p>
For a long time, Albert&rsquo;s writings in ethics received little
attention from modern scholars, especially in comparison to his
metaphysics and to a lesser extent his writing on natural science.
Yet, Albert himself seems always to have had a strong interest in this
part of philosophy. This shows in his very early and unfortunately
incomplete <em>On the Nature of the Good</em> (<em>De natura
boni</em>) and <em>On the Good</em> (<em>De bono</em>), whose topics
pertain mostly to moral philosophy. Against then-existing curriculum
regulations, Albert also lectured on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> to his students at the Dominican <em>studium</em> he was
tasked to establish in 1248, in Cologne, and he is seen as an
important reason why, when the Dominican program of study was revised
by the General Chapter of Valenciennes a few years later, such
lectures became authorized and subsequently common in the Dominican
Order&rsquo;s schools. Finally, he wrote two substantial commentaries
on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, something he did not do for any
other work, including metaphysics and theology. This is even more
remarkable given that by the time he wrote his second commentary, in
1262, he was still the only philosopher in the Latin West to have ever
written a full commentary on that book. And yet, as critical a scholar
as R. A. Gauthier (1970: 123) claims that Albert&rsquo;s first
commentary is better by far than all the many other ones that would be
written during the rest of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>
A certain number of consensuses can be seen emerging among scholars
who have delved into Albert&rsquo;s ethics (see in particular
M&uuml;ller 2001 and Cuningham 2008). First, at a time when
traditional theologians still dominated the field of ethics at
institutions of higher learning (theologians who, it should be noted,
considered the input of philosophers to be of secondary importance at
best), Albert tries to present as valuable in itself a purely rational
or philosophical inquiry into moral matters. Albert&rsquo;s original
effort in the prologues of his commentaries on the <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> (<em>Super Ethica</em>, prologus, 2; <em>Ethica</em>, I,
1, 2) to show that ethics can be a science the way it is defined by
Aristotle in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, his general reliance on
Aristotle&rsquo;s analysis of the virtues and his strong case that the
latter&rsquo;s understanding of a this-wordly happiness brought about
by a life of virtuous activity is not in tension with the Christian
belief that true happiness will only come from God in the afterlife
(<em>Super IV libros Sententiarum</em>, IV, 49, 7, p.678b) are some of
the elements that characterize Albert&rsquo;s attempt to legitimize
philosophical ethics. Albert also makes it clear that he considers
Aristotle, regardless of his limitations and the fact that he is a
pagan, to be a model of how a philosopher or rational thinker must
approach the main problems of ethics. Perhaps because he takes him
much more seriously, Albert&rsquo;s understanding of Aristotle seems
deeper than that of most of his predecessors (Celano 2006), and
serious moral philosophers who will come after him &mdash; such as
Aquinas or Boethius of Dacia &mdash; are all influenced by the work
done by Albert in one way or another.</p>

<p>
Another fundamental contribution or trait of Albert&rsquo;s moral
thought is receiving greater emphasis nowadays, especially as his
second commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> becomes the
object of more studies. Albert, and more precisely mature Albert, is
now often associated with a more intellectualist and so to speak
metaphysical conception of happiness (M&uuml;ller 2009). This is
usually seen as an effect of the influence that Arabic philosophers
such as Alfarabi, Avicenna and Averroes exercised on him and as
something that to a small extent leads Albert away from his earlier,
purer ethical Aristotelianism and toward the Neoplatonism that is in
the background of much of Arabic philosophy. Albert seems to have
maintained very early on that the highest form of (earthly) happiness
lies in the metaphysician&rsquo;s contemplation of the highest
realities that is produced by a morally virtuous and well-ordered
existence and the life-long practice of the rational study of the
world rooted in sense experience. However, he appears to push this one
step further in his middle and later works by repeatedly claiming,
using a vocabulary typical of his Arabic sources, that this
contemplation is an act of the &ldquo;acquired intellect&rdquo;,
<em>intellectus adeptus</em> (<em>Ethica</em>, X, 2, 4, p. 632a). This
corresponds to a state of the soul in which the human agent intellect,
which separates universal forms from matter and thus reveals the
intelligibility they inherently possess as emanations of the Divine
Intellect, not only activates our capacity to understand and is
conjoined with it when doing so, but activates it so continuously and
perfectly as to become the very form of the human being in as much as
it perfects him in the activity that defines him precisely as human
(<em>De anima</em>, III, 3, 11). That state of perfection in the
understanding of all intelligible forms culminates in the
contemplation of separate substances and consists in acts of
intellectual intuition which, once reached, are performed
independently of sense perception and imagination (<em>Ethica</em>,
VI, 2, 17, p.430a; <em>De anima</em>, III, 2, 19, p.206,
l.49&ndash;54) &mdash; something Albert had earlier maintained is
impossible for natural reason to do in this life (<em>Super
Ethica</em>, I, 13, 80, p.71, l.91&ndash;p.72, l.6; X, 13, 906, p.759,
l.29&ndash;38). Moral virtues at times appear to be reduced to a
precondition of the contemplative life, in as much as they not simply
moderate but more radically free the subject from his bestial side and
passions, lest they perturb his intellect (<em>Ethica</em>, X, 2, 3,
p.627b; <em>Super Ethica</em>, X, 12, 903, p.757, l.21&ndash;25, and
904, p.757, l.50&ndash;64), &ldquo;through which he becomes somewhat
similar to a god&rdquo; (<em>De anima</em>, III, 3, 11, p.222,
l.80&ndash;84). This contemplation is itself a preparation for and
foretaste of the return to and union with God in the afterlife, the
true and ultimate end of the immortal human being, about which,
however, philosophy has little to say (<em>Super Ethica</em>, I, 3,
19, p.17, 52&ndash;55).</p>

<p>
Albert&rsquo;s moral thought greatly influences his political
philosophy, a field in which he once again plays the role of a
trailblazer, being the first in the Latin West to comment on
Aristotle&rsquo;s recently translated <em>Politics</em>. Assuredly,
Albert appears to agree with the main tenets of the Stagirite&rsquo;s
political philosophy, be it the naturalness of political society and
its necessity for the human good, the non-dissociation of ethics and
politics or the acceptability of different types of rules (i.e. by
one, the few or the many) depending on circumstances. Society&rsquo;s
political structure is naturally ordered toward the common good of
citizens, which entails ensuring that there is order, peace, enough
material wealth, virtuous habits and leisure. For Albert, however,
chief among the things that a well-governed society makes possible is
the above-described contemplation of the highest things, which appears
to be the ultimate end of the polity as well. This contemplative
felicity therefore plays the role of a first principle in political
philosophy, provided by ethics (<em>Super Ethica</em>, I, 7, 35, p.32,
l.74&ndash;p.33, l.15; X, 19, 947, p.789, l.50&ndash;p.790, l.15;
<em>Ethica</em>, I, 9, 1, p.140a).</p>

<h2 id="AlbeHeir">8. Albert&rsquo;s Heirs</h2>

<p>
Albert had a noticeable impact on philosophers in the thirteenth,
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The main manner in which he
influenced his contemporaries and successors is impossible to
quantify, but it should not go unmentioned, as it often does.
Albert&rsquo;s openness to the wisdom of Ancient Greek and Arabic
pagans, rationality and the careful study of nature made him one of
the leaders of a group of thinkers that quickly allowed the European
Christian world to reach philosophical heights that had been
inaccessible to Western civilization since the end of Antiquity. In
that sense, an important part of the even greater influence that his
pupil and fellow theologian Thomas Aquinas exercised is also his
master&rsquo;s. However, Albert&rsquo;s activity as a teacher
encouraged and shaped many other intellectual vocations, who receive
today more attention than they used to. Among those who were the
direct or indirect products of Albert&rsquo;s teaching, one should
first mention a certain number of German Dominicans: Hugh Ripelin of
Strasbourg (&dagger; 1268), whose <em>Compendium of Theological
Truth</em> was long used as a school manual and was for a time
attributed to Albert himself; Ulrich of Strasbourg (1220&ndash;1277),
who authored the six-book <em>On the Supreme Good</em> (<em>De summo
bono</em>); Dietrich of Freiberg (1240/1250&ndash;1318/1320), whose
writings touch upon philosophy, theology and natural science; and
Berthold of Moosburg (&dagger;1361 or later), who wrote an important
commentary on Proclus&rsquo; <em>Elements of Theology</em>. (One could
arguably add to that Albertine German Dominican school Meister Eckhart
[c. 1260&ndash;1328].) Moreover, Albert is sometimes suspected to have
had an impact on some of the so-called &ldquo;Latin Averroists&rdquo;
(for example John of Jandun [c. 1285&ndash;1328], but also others), in
particular through his views on the nature of the intellect and
contemplative felicity, but the influence in this case is harder to
delineate and more debatable. Finally, the fifteenth century also
witnessed the development in some French, German and Italian
universities of what is now customarily called
&ldquo;Albertism&rdquo;. Led by the scholars John de Nova Domo
(&dagger; 1418) and Heymeric de Campo (1395&ndash;1460), it strongly
and systematically promoted Albert&rsquo;s ideas and reading of
Aristotle, often in opposition to nominalism or even contemporary
Thomism.</p>

<p>
The great number of books that falsely circulated under Albert&rsquo;s
name soon after his death attests to a renown and authority that
already in the Middle Ages went beyond academic circles, even though
the mediocrity or idiocy of some of those apocrypha ended up unfairly
damaging Albert&rsquo;s reputation in the modern world.</p>

<h2 id="Bib">Bibliography</h2>

<h3 id="AlbeGreaWork">Albert the Great&rsquo;s Works</h3>

<p>
There exist three comprehensive editions of Albert&rsquo;s works:</p>

<p>
&bull; <em>Opera omnia</em>, ed. P. Jammy, Lyon: Claude Prost,
1651</p>

<p>
&bull; <em>Opera omnia</em>, ed. A. and &Eacute;. Borgnet, Paris:
Viv&egrave;s, 1890&ndash;1899</p>

<p>
&bull; <em>Opera omnia</em>, ed. B. Geyer (and his successors over
time), M&uuml;nster: Aschendorff, 1951&ndash;ongoing</p>

<p>
The second edition is largely based on the first one, and only the
third one, led by the Albertus-Magnus-Institut in Bonn and nicknamed
<em>Editio Coloniensis</em> because the Institut was initially located
in Cologne, is a critical edition and contains no spurious works. It
will include all extant works when completed. While we await said
completion, some volumes from the Paris edition (<em>Editio
Parisiensis</em>) and a few works edited individually in the last two
centuries remain essential.</p>

<p>
Given the exceptionally high number of Albert&rsquo;s extant works,
the following is a list of only some of his most philosophically
significant writings, which includes a few whose general intention is
theological but which are filled with philosophical distinctions and
developments. (For a truly exhaustive list of Albert&rsquo;s works and
editions and translations thereof, see Other Internet Resources,
below.) Works are here named as and listed in the order in which the
Institut has edited or plans to edit them, even when only another
edition is available for now. Full English translations of the listed
works are also mentioned.</p>
