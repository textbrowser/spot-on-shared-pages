<p>
In many contexts, the efficient production of a good by a group is
jeopardized by the incentive each member of the group has not to
contribute towards its production. If</p>

<ol id="features" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="featurei">the benefit received by each member of the group
depends mainly on the level of others&rsquo; contribution towards
producing it,</li>

<li id="featureii">the cost of any one member&rsquo;s contribution is
likely to be greater than the resulting benefit to that member,
and</li>

<li id="featureiii">one member&rsquo;s decision whether or not to
contribute will have little effect on the level of contribution by
others,</li>
</ol>

<p>
then each member may have an incentive not to contribute, leaving the
work of producing the good to the others. In situations with this
structure, I can reason: if others are producing the good, I will
receive it without contributing; if not, I will not receive it if I do
contribute; so either way, I am better off not contributing. But if
many of us reason in the same way, this can threaten to make each
worse off than they would have been if all had contributed. This is
the free rider problem, which has two main manifestations. In its
non-production manifestation, these incentives prevent us from
producing the good at all. In its free riding manifestation, the good
is being produced because some group members are contributing, but it
is being produced inefficiently because of the non-contribution of
others (the free riders). Notice that in the non-production
manifestation, there is a free rider problem but no free
riding&mdash;because there is no good-production on which to free
ride.</p>

<p>
The most familiar free rider problems arise in connection with the
production and consumption of public goods. Contribution towards the
production of a public good can either take the form of giving up
one&rsquo;s own resources in a pooled effort to produce a good that
would not exist independently of our actions (for example,
volunteering for military service in defence against an external
threat) or of constraining one&rsquo;s own actions as part of a joint
effort to reduce the bad effects that are produced when many of us act
in an unconstrained way (for example, limiting pollution). We can call
these resource contribution and constraint cases, respectively.</p>

<p>
The free rider problem invites three kinds of investigation, which
this article discusses. There are analytical investigations that seek
to understand the dynamics through which free rider problems can
arise. There are remedial investigations that seek to identify the
range of available solutions to free rider problems, and explain how
it is that uncoerced public goods production does actually occur. And
there is also a set of normative questions asked by moral and
political philosophy. Does the free rider problem illuminate the
function of morality or the value of the state? Under what conditions
is free riding wrong, and if so, why? Can a foundation for political
obligation be found in an anti-free-riding principle? And under what
circumstances can coercion justifiably be used by the state to
resource the stable production of public goods, and to punish and
deter free riding?</p>

<p>
These different investigations have been a focus of interest in seven
main disciplines. Social psychology asks: To what extent and in what
circumstances are people motivated to free ride? and What sorts of
countervailing incentives are effective in motivating cooperation when
free riding is possible? Game theory asks: Under what circumstances
does the rational pursuit of individual self-interest recommend free
riding? Informed by those two areas of enquiry, mainstream economics
then asks: What real-world mechanisms are the most efficient ways of
producing public goods, given the incentives to free ride? Political
science asks: What explains the existence of stable public goods
production where it does occur, despite the incentives that favor free
riding? Evolutionary biology asks: do we need group selection to
explain the evolution of the cooperation-securing dispositions that
can solve the free rider problem, or is individual selection
sufficient? Moral philosophy asks: Under exactly which circumstances
is free riding morally wrong, and what explains why it is wrong (when
it is)? And relatedly, normative political philosophy asks: Do the
moral reasons against free riding supply a grounding for political
obligation?</p>

<p>
This article starts by locating the free rider problem in relation to
other kinds of collective action problem

 then describes some of the major landmarks in the history of

 Analytical investigations of the problem are examined in

 remedial investigations in

discussing the treatment of the free rider problem within moral

 and political philosophy
 (<a href="#FreRidProPolPhi">&sect;6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ColActPro">1. Collective Action Problems</h2>

<p>
A collective action problem is a situation in which it is better for
every member of a group that everyone does A than that no one does A,
but conflicts in what the parties regard as being in their own
interest risk producing an outcome that is worse for every member than
everyone&rsquo;s doing A would be. Collective action problems contrast
with coordination problems. In a coordination problem, producing a
mutually advantageous outcome (such as meeting at a rendezvous point)
can be obstructed by a lack of information, not by the conflicting
interests of the parties (Cronk &amp; Leech 2013: Ch.
 1).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This description of collective action problems is deliberately broad,
covering problems of many different kinds. It allows that collective
action problems can arise when, in fact, each person&rsquo;s interests
are best served by that person&rsquo;s doing <em>A</em>, but many
people instead falsely believe that they are individually better off
not doing <em>A</em>. And it allows for various different ways of
specifying what it takes for an outcome to be better or worse for an
individual. However, notice that the distinction between collective
action problems and coordination problems precludes identifying
interests with preference-satisfaction. If you and I fail to meet
because, having agreed to rendezvous at the cathedral, I proceed to St
Patrick&rsquo;s while you go to St Brendan&rsquo;s, then while we are
en route we have different preferences (mine being that I arrive at St
Patrick&rsquo;s, yours being that you arrive at St Brendan&rsquo;s);
so if interests consisted in mere preference-satisfaction, our
interests in this case would conflict. On the preference-satisfaction
view, whenever a mutually advantageous outcome is obstructed by a
failure of information it would also be obstructed by conflicting
interests, so the distinction between coordination problems and
collective action problems would be lost.</p>

<p>
The free rider problem can be defined as that particular kind of
collective action problem that arises when the efficient collective
production of a good is jeopardized by the incentive each agent has
not to contribute towards its production. Not all collective action
problems are free rider problems&mdash;for example, a chicken game has
the following strategic structure (where the cells represent the
outcomes of the actions available to the two parties, and the numbers
represent each party&rsquo;s preference-ranking of the given
outcome):</p>

<div class="figure center" id="fig1">
<img alt="a strategic game: link to extended description below" src="fig1.svg" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of figure 1</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
In a chicken game, conflicting interests jeopardize the attainment of
a mutually advantageous outcome, so it is a collective action problem;
but it is not a free rider problem, since it is not a situation in
which the efficient collective production of a good is jeopardized by
each agent&rsquo;s incentive not to contribute.</p>

<p>
One common way in which free rider problems commonly arise is through
strategic situations whose underlying structure is that of a
multi-party Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma. An <em>n</em>-party
Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma can be defined as a situation in which the
possible outcomes of interaction between several agents are ranked by
each agent as follows:</p>

<div class="figure">

<table class="cell-center cellpad-small-dense inner-boxTH nocaption smaller">
<thead>
<tr class="vert-bot">
<th scope="col">agent</th>
<th scope="col">all others cooperate</th>
<th scope="col">\(m\) others cooperate
<br />
\((0&lt; m&lt; n-1)\)</th>
<th scope="col">no others cooperate</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row">cooperates</th>
  <td>rank \(r\) \((r &gt; 1)\)</td>
  <td>\(&gt; s_m\) (but not worst)</td>
  <td>worst</td> </tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">does not cooperate</th>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>rank \(s_m\) \((s_m &gt; 1)\)</td>
  <td>\(&gt; r\) (but not worst)</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2</span></p>
</div>


<p>
When everyone has this preference-structure, three significant
consequences follow. First, non-cooperation dominates: each agent
prefers non-cooperation, whatever the others do. (In each column, the
bottom cell is ranked higher than the top.) Second, each prefers
everyone&rsquo;s cooperating to everyone&rsquo;s not cooperating. (The
top left cell is ranked higher than the bottom right&nbsp;cell.) And
third, for each agent the highest-ranked outcome is the one where that
agent is the only non-cooperator and the lowest ranked outcome is the
one where they are the only cooperator. (These are the bottom left and
top right cells.) While sharing these three features in common,
different <em>n</em>-party Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas can have
different rankings of the other possible outcomes. In some
<em>n</em>-party Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas, the outcome in which
everyone cooperates (rank <em>r</em>) is ranked higher than every
outcome in which there is an intermediate number <em>m</em> of others
who cooperate <span class="nobr">(rank \(s_m\));</span> in some,
<em>r</em> is ranked lower than \(s_m\) for every intermediate number
<em>m</em>; and in others, there is some number of cooperators for
which \(r &gt; s_m\) when <em>m</em> is greater than that number and
otherwise <span class="nobr">\(r &lt; s_m\).</span></p>

<p>
But despite this variety, the category of multi-party Prisoner&rsquo;s
Dilemmas is not capacious enough to include all free rider problems.
In particular, a free rider problem can fail to have the first of the
multi-party Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma&rsquo;s three distinguishing
features (domination). As we will see, free rider problems can become
more acute in very large groups, when the benefit accruing to any
agent from their own contribution is small and social monitoring of
contributions is weak, than it is in small ones; but when the number
of contributors is small and the good to be provided is important,
contributing to its provision might then serve one&rsquo;s interests
best. For example, if a police service is supported by the resources
contributed by millions of people, I may have an incentive to enjoy
the service without paying for it; but if there is no public policing
it may be in my interests to join a local vigilante group to increase
my own security significantly. If so, there can be situations in
which, given that the number of contributors is actually large, the
efficient provision of a good is jeopardized by the incentive for
non-contribution, so we have a free rider problem; but where
non-cooperation does not dominate, since it is not true that
non-cooperation is preferred whatever the pattern of cooperation or
non-cooperation by others is, so we do not have a Prisoner&rsquo;s
Dilemma.</p>

<p>
Finally, specifying further, we come to Tragedy of the Commons cases:
those where every member of a group has free access to a common
resource, and unrestricted use produces full depletion of that
resource (G. Hardin 1968). This is one specific kind of multi-party
Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma, to be distinguished from other kinds that do
not involve resource depletion. It is true that a Tragedy of the
Commons need not involve any free riding: if no one constrains their
resource use, no one is free riding on the contributions of others
towards producing a good. But as we saw, that is not a good test of
whether we face a free rider problem. In a Tragedy of the Commons, the
good of sustainable ongoing access to the common resource is
jeopardized by the incentive each has (through unrestricted use) not
to contribute towards producing that good. So a Tragedy of the Commons
is one particular way in which a free rider problem can arise. It is a
specific (common resource) kind of multi-party Prisoner&rsquo;s
Dilemma, which is a specific kind of strategic structure that
underlies some but not all free rider problems (those where
non-cooperation dominates), which are in turn a specific kind of
collective action problem&mdash;the kind in which the efficient
collective production of a good is jeopardized by each agent&rsquo;s
incentive not to contribute.</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the classification of some situations as free
rider problems or not depends on which agents we are considering. For
example, the problem of global climate change, when considered as a
problem concerning the actions of cross-temporally persisting nations,
is a free rider problem. It is a constraint case in which all nations
will ultimately end up worse off than they would have been had they
all restricted their net emissions. However, at the level of
individuals, it seems not to be a free rider problem. The costs of the
resource use of currently living old and rich individuals will
primarily be borne by the younger and future poor, and this will
continue to be true in the future as one generation passes on the
burdens of its resource use to the next (Gardiner 2001). Within any
given generation, those who pass on those burdens are not themselves
worse off than they would all have been had they restricted their
resource use. At the level of individuals, then, the climate change
problem is not a free rider problem, or even a collective action
problem as defined here: it is worse than that.</p>

<h2 id="His">2. History</h2>

<h3 id="Pla">2.1 Plato</h3>

<p>
Investigations of the incentive structures that underlie the free
rider problem have ancient roots. In Plato, we find a sustained
interest in the conflict between incentives of self-interest and the
norms sustaining social order. To Callicles in the <em>Gorgias</em> he
gives the view that standards of justice are a device insinuated by
the weak to constrain the strong; to Thrasymachus in Book I of the
<em>Republic</em> he gives the view that, on the contrary, they are a
device imposed by the strong to oppress the weak. These opposing views
then produce a common challenge: for someone whose own interests are
not served by conforming to the standards of justice, what good reason
is there to do so? Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus&rsquo; form of the
challenge in the <em>Republic</em> Book II, then refines it further:
in many circumstances, one&rsquo;s own conformity with standards of
justice is instrumentally advantageous; but what about the possible or
actual circumstances in which it is not?</p>

<p>
Plato does not get all the way to articulating the free rider problem
itself, however. While he is interested in the incentives that
underlie it, his concern is not with the strategic problem that these
incentives pose to the collective production of the goods the free
rider enjoys. And in the context of his discussions, this makes good
sense. It is not a satisfactory reply to either Callicles or
Thrasymachus to point out that the very goods the free rider enjoys
depend on others&rsquo; not free riding. That is not yet a reply to
someone who wants to know what good reason they have to
contribute.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, in developing Socrates&rsquo; answer to the challenge in
the remaining books of the <em>Republic</em>, Plato does supply what
would be a distinctively Socratic solution to the free rider problem.
This involves challenging the free rider&rsquo;s conception of what
one&rsquo;s own interests consist in. If, as Socrates maintains, the
virtue of justice itself (as a state of harmony in the soul) is a
constituent part of one&rsquo;s own good, then it is a mistake to
think that it ever really is in one&rsquo;s true interest to act
unjustly. The implication of Socrates&rsquo; view, apparently endorsed
by Plato, is that philosophy can help to alter one&rsquo;s incentives
in a pro-social direction through dispelling a mistaken conception of
one&rsquo;s own interests. And as applied to Socrates himself, this
view can explain both his willingness to submit himself for execution
by the state of Athens (as a contribution to recognizing and upholding
the just authority of the state) and his commitment to the
philosophical teaching for which he was executed (as a contribution to
helping the young to form the right conception of their own true
interests).</p>

<h3 id="Hob">2.2 Hobbes</h3>

<p>
The strategic structure of the free rider problem, and its
significance for what were to become the social sciences, first come
into focus in the writings of Hobbes. In <em>Leviathan</em> (1651)
Hobbes&rsquo;s interest is best characterized as analytical and
remedial, rather than normative (Hampton 1986: Ch. 1). His concern is
with a constraint version of the free rider problem, with respect to
the good of civil peace. Given an understanding of human motivation as
predominantly self-interested&nbsp;and interested above all in our own
self-preservation, Hobbes sees himself as producing a science of moral
philosophy, demonstrating the rules of conduct that are necessary to
serve our own interests most effectively (<em>Leviathan</em>: Ch. 15
[1996: 110&ndash;11]). Given our natural equality of power and mutual
vulnerability, it is better for each of us that we all live under a
law-enforcing sovereign that is sufficiently powerful to give us
effective incentives not to attack each other. Without this, the state
of nature this leaves us in is a war of all against all that is worse
for everyone (including those who succeed in defending themselves).
Given how much worse the state of nature is, it is in the interests of
each to support the establishment of a sovereign who can enforce civil
order, thereby leaving oneself (and everyone else) better off than
they would be without it. We get a</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
deduction, of Sovereign Rights, from the nature, need, and designs of
men, in erecting of Commonwealths, and putting themselves under
Monarchs, or Assemblies, entrusted with power enough for their
protection. (<em>Leviathan</em>: Ch. 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hobbes&rsquo;s solution to the free-rider problem is not, like the one
suggested by Socrates, an internal solution, changing our incentives
in a pro-social direction through philosophically-based psychological
reform. Instead, it is an external solution, imposing effective enough
coercive penalties to change the self-interested calculus for each
individual in a way that makes compliance rational for
(unSocratically) self-interested agents. The contribution philosophy
can make towards solving the problem is not to change our conception
of our own interests, but to remove errors in our reasoning about how
best to satisfy them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The cause, therefore, of civil war is, that men know not the causes
neither of war nor peace, there being but few in the world that have
learned those duties which unite and keep men in peace, that is to
say, that have learned the rules of civil life sufficiently. (<em>De
Corpore</em>: Ch. 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In effect, the state puts us in a position in which we should agree
with Glaucon: justice is, actually, instrumentally rational for each
of us. Hobbes&rsquo; understanding of the strategic structure of the
problem allows him to explain the stability of the solution: if the
power of an authoritative sovereign is either to be imposed on
everyone or not to be imposed at all, it is in the interests of each
that it be imposed.</p>

<p>
Given this, it is not mysterious on Hobbes&rsquo;s view why there
should be a state: this is better for everyone, and therefore is
preferred by all self-interested agents (which is to say for Hobbes:
all agents), as long as they are not reasoning erroneously. The
problem that remains to be resolved is what has subsequently come to
be classified as a battle-of-the-sexes problem, whose basic strategic
structure in the two-party case is this:</p>

<div class="figure center" id="fig2">
<img alt="a strategic game: link to extended description below" src="fig2.svg" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig2">extended description of figure 3</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Here, there is a mixture of coordination problem and conflicting
interests. It is better for each of us to coordinate with the other
than to miss out on the benefits of coordination, but we have
competing interests regarding the available coordination points. As
applied to Hobbes&rsquo;s case, it is better for each person that we
coordinate on a sovereign; but some of the different possible
sovereigns are better for some citizens; others for others. Warring
over this can then threaten to leave us without a state altogether
(giving us a free rider problem in its non-production
manifestation).</p>

<p>
In itself, this problem is a strength of Hobbes&rsquo;s theory, not a
weakness: as an explanatory theory, it has to accommodate the observed
facts of civil strife. However, it leads him to the most contentious
part of his political theory: the claim that solving this problem
requires a sovereign whose power is undivided and unlimited&mdash;an
absolute monarch. How such a sovereign could be justly established
seems not to be a question that Hobbes&rsquo;s system has room for: in
his system, justice lies downstream, not upstream, from the
establishment of a sovereign power. It can be in the interests of all
to coordinate on an individual in whom to vest this power, and the
rules of justice are those that are then imposed by the sovereign to
secure civil order.</p>

<p>
Political science has largely resisted this part of Hobbes&rsquo;s
theory. Fully unrestricted political power includes the absence of
restrictions on persecuting political opponents: since this raises the
stakes in contests over political control, it is frequently a source
of conflict and oppression, rather than a guarantee of peace and
personal liberty. After Hobbes, a major preoccupation of political
theory has been to examine the mechanisms through which democratic
decision-making can handle the battle-of-the-sexes problem for
determining political authority; to explain how this can secure a
stable solution if and because it is recognized as just; and to
analyse the structural threats to it (Przeworski 1988, 2010,
2016).</p>

<h3 id="Hum">2.3 Hume</h3>

<p>
While a recognition of the strategic structure of the free rider
problem is implicit in Hobbes&rsquo;s discussion of the authority of
the state, it is both explicit and general in Hume. He writes in the
Treatise:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in
common; because &rsquo;tis easy for them to know each other&rsquo;s
mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his
failing in his part, is, the abandoning the whole project. But
&rsquo;tis very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand
persons should agree in any such action; it being difficult for them
to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult for them
to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the
trouble and expense, and would lay the whole burden on others.
(1739&ndash;40: &sect;3.2.7 [1978: 538]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we very clearly have a recognition of how the non-participatory
incentive to &ldquo;lay the whole burden on others&rdquo; can lead to
the failure to produce a significant good, and of how the
disincentives become greater obstacles to cooperative action in larger
groups than small ones.</p>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s interest in the problem, like Hobbes&rsquo;s, is
explanatory rather than normative. Indeed, when later in the Second
Enquiry he considers the &ldquo;sensible knave&rdquo;&mdash;someone
who regards it as wise to practise honesty when, as often, it is the
best policy but to take advantage of all the exceptions&mdash;Hume
confesses</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that, if a man think that this reasoning much requires an answer, it
would be a little difficult to find any which will to him appear
satisfactory and convincing. If his heart rebel not against such
pernicious maxims, if he feel no reluctance to the thoughts of
villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a considerable motive to
virtue. (1751: 9.2.23 [1975: 283])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s interest is not in refuting the sensible knave, but in
explaining the sense of justice that most of us have and the sensible
knave lacks. However, Hume&rsquo;s explanatory interest differs from
Hobbes&rsquo;s. Unlike Hobbes, Hume is interested in the non-egoistic
parts of our psychological make-up, and he wants to explain how our
thought and action could come to acquire the complex character it has.
In Hume&rsquo;s psychological picture, three main elements are in play
that explain our attitudes and behaviour when faced with free rider
problems. We develop a sense of justice, as an &ldquo;artificial
virtue&rdquo;: given the existence of cooperative conventions that are
mutually useful in rendering us all better off than we would be
without them, our dispositions to comply with those conventions can
then attain the status of virtues by being appreciated as useful or
agreeable by others. Secondly, given others&rsquo; endorsement and
acceptance of those conventions and their disapproval and sanction of
infringements of them, it can become instrumentally advantageous to
comply with those conventions, given our interest in others&rsquo;
goodwill. But then, thirdly, our psychology does also contain the
narrowly self-interested incentives that create the free rider
problem. We are both selfishly and altruistically motivated. So while
in smaller groups free rider problems can be solved without coercive
intervention to change our incentives, as groups get larger this
becomes increasingly difficult (as he points out in the
meadow-draining example).</p>

<p>
To emphasize the point: Hume&rsquo;s account of the artificial virtue
of justice is not presented as a solution to free rider problems: it
presupposes that there are already cooperative conventions in
existence, in response to which the artificial virtue can develop. But
it is an account of one of the psychological elements that can be
mobilized in opposition to self-interest, as part of the explanation
of how such conventions can stably persist (Sayre-McCord 2016).</p>

<h3 id="TweCenDev">2.4 Twentieth-Century Developments</h3>

<p>
In the twentieth century, the free rider problem becomes a more direct
object of study within economics and the other social sciences, and is
illuminated by game-theoretical research into the strategic structures
underlying different collective action problems.</p>

<p>
In 1916, Vilfredo Pareto gives a sharp statement of the free rider
problem in constraint cases (rather than resource contribution cases)
in this passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If all individuals refrained from doing A, every individual as a
member of the community would derive a certain advantage. But now if
all individuals less one continue refraining from doing A, the
community loss is very slight, whereas the one individual doing A
makes a personal gain far greater than the loss that he incurs as a
member of the community. (Pareto 1916 [1935: vol. 3, sect. 1496, pp.
946&ndash;7])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, we find him sharply articulating
 <a href="#featureii">feature (ii)</a>
 in our initial description of the problem&mdash;the cost of any one
member&rsquo;s contribution is greater than the resulting benefit to
that member. And although his description directly covers only
constraint cases, where the relevant contribution is not performing an
action of a type whose unconstrained performance by many of us
produces bad effects, his description can easily be extended to
resource production cases.</p>

<p>
The 1950s see significant developments in game theory and economics in
understanding some of the key contributory components of free rider
problems. In game theory, Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950
formalize (for the 2-party case) the mathematical structure of what
came to be known as the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma (through an example
given by Albert Tucker; see Flood 1958, Peterson 2015). In economics,
Paul Samuelson (1954) mathematically defines what he calls
&ldquo;collective consumption&rdquo; goods as those for which every
consumer consumes the total output, emphasizing the implication that
for goods of this type no one&rsquo;s consumption subtracts from
anyone else&rsquo;s, and deriving a description of the necessary
conditions for the optimal production of such goods.</p>

<p>
With Mancur Olson&rsquo;s <em>The Logic of Collective Action</em>
(1965), the first book-length study of the free rider problem is
published, providing the platform for much of what has followed. A
lesson that Olson draws from the free rider problem is that social
theory makes a fundamental mistake when it seeks to explain and
predict the behaviour of a group by treating the interests of its
members as a set of component forces and accounting for the behaviour
of the group as the vector sum of those forces. Olson elaborates and
explains Hume&rsquo;s observation that free rider problems become
stronger as group size increases, and he argues that, in a democracy,
the interests of tightly integrated minorities will tend to be
overrepresented, prevailing over the interests of a more loosely
affiliated majority. He also offers a &ldquo;by-product&rdquo; theory
of how to solve free rider problems: by attaching ancillary private
benefits to participation in collective action, effective incentives
to contribute can be established and the benefits of collective action
secured&mdash;as for example when union membership is accompanied by
discounted insurance policies.</p>

<p>
Subsequently, a significant focus of political science research into
the free rider problem has been on conducting empirical work that
seeks to explain how and why uncoerced solutions to it are obtainable.
A centrepiece of this work is Elinor Ostrom&rsquo;s <em>Governing the
Commons</em> (1990), which focuses on ecological management,
investigating how the free rider problem in its Tragedy of the Commons
form has been solved, under certain replicable conditions, without
resorting to either state regulation or private ownership.</p>

<h2 id="CauFreRidPro">3. The Causes of Free Rider Problems</h2>

<p>
The free rider problem arises when the efficient collective production
of a good is jeopardized by the incentive each agent has not to
contribute towards its production. As such, it is a type of recurring
real-world problem that is sometimes actually solved, and other times
not. It is not itself an abstract game-theoretic strategic structure.
There are two main sets of interacting components in play, which
combine to produce a free rider problem. One is the underlying
strategic structure of the situation in which the problem arises. The
other is the way that human psychology tends to operate in situations
with that structure.</p>

<h3 id="StrStr">3.1 Strategic Structure</h3>

<p>
The first major contributor to whether a free rider problem arises in
a given situation is the strategic structure of the situation. A
situation&rsquo;s strategic structure consists in the features
determining what it would be rational for narrowly self-interested,
rational agents to do in that situation&mdash;the subject studied by
game theory. That description invites the question &ldquo;What is
narrow self-interest?&rdquo;, which of course is a further large
topic. We saw earlier that, once we make the distinction between
collective action problems and coordination problems, an agent&rsquo;s
interests cannot simply be identified with the satisfaction of their
preferences; and their narrow self-interest will have to exclude such
things as Socrates&rsquo; virtue of justice in order for
game-theoretic analysis to work. However, rather than examining more
fully the issues this raises, it will suffice here to work simply with
the intuitive idea of an agent&rsquo;s material advantage&mdash;the
incentives connected to this are what matters in producing free rider
problems.</p>

<p>
It was pointed out above that, although the strategic structure most
commonly associated with free rider problems is that of a multi-party
Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma, this is not essential. A free rider problem
can arise in situations in which non-contribution does not
dominate&mdash;that is, in which it is not true that non-contribution
is rational for a narrowly self-interested agent whatever other agents
do. Self-interest can actually favour non-contribution, so we get a
free rider problem; but if, were the number of contributors smaller,
self-interest would favour contribution, we do not have a
Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma.</p>

<p>
So the strategic structure that is conducive to producing free rider
problems is broader than the class of Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas.
Instead, it can be described in terms of the three
 <a href="#features">features (i)&ndash;(iii)</a>
 we began with. Where &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; refers to narrow
self-interest, the first relevant feature is that the benefit received
by each member of the group depends mainly on the level of
others&rsquo; contribution towards producing it. This allows that
one&rsquo;s own contribution may produce some enhancement of the
benefit one receives. But&mdash;this is the second feature&mdash;the
cost of any one member&rsquo;s contribution is likely to be greater
than the resulting benefit to that member. This second feature allows
for the possibility of levels of contribution by others for which
contributing produces a net benefit to the contributor, but says that
this is unlikely. And the third feature is that one member&rsquo;s
decision whether or not to contribute is independent of
others&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Situations with those three structural features are especially
conducive to producing free rider problems. However, a free rider
problem is not itself a strategic structure. Strategic structures are
descriptions of the situational features determining what perfectly
rational and narrowly self-interested agents would do. Free rider
problems are problems for actual agents&mdash;agents who are neither
perfectly rational nor narrowly self-interested. To the extent that
their behaviour approximates that of the agents modelled by game
theory, those models are helpful in understanding how free rider
problems arise. But a free rider problem should not be identified with
the strategic structure that gives rise to it: it is the outcome of
the interaction between that structure and the psychologies of the
agents involved.</p>

<h3 id="PsyFac">3.2 Psychological Factors</h3>

<p>
The free rider problem, as we have defined it, concerns the
agents&rsquo; incentives not to contribute towards the production of a
good. A situation&rsquo;s strategic structure is relevant to whether
the agents face a free rider problem because of its effect on their
incentives. But just what effect it has on those incentives depends on
various psychological factors.</p>

<p>
First, actual agents are not perfectly well-informed, and they are not
perfectly rational. This carries the implication that a free rider
problem can arise in a situation in which a perfectly rational,
well-informed and narrowly self-interested agent would prefer to
contribute. Perhaps the
 <a href="#features">conditions (i)&ndash;(iii)</a>
 do not actually hold, but the agents involved are misinformed and
falsely believe that they do hold, or the agents have the correct
information but interpret it irrationally. For example, suppose that
the union officials adopt Olson&rsquo;s by-product strategy for
encouraging union membership, attaching an insurance discount to the
membership benefits. The discount might be large enough to make it
rational to join, but if many of us ignore the offer letter or
miscalculate the benefit, we might still actually face a free rider
problem.</p>

<p>
And, second, actual agents are not always exclusively self-interested.
This can in one respect make free rider problems easier to avoid, but
in another it makes this harder. The respect in which it makes it
easier is that Hume seems right that most of us are equipped with
pro-social attitudes that make some difference to our behaviour. The
idealized agents of game theory are all Humean &ldquo;sensible
knaves&rdquo; who &ldquo;feel no reluctance to the thoughts of
villainy or baseness&rdquo;. But most actual agents do feel at least
some reluctance to the thoughts of villainy or baseness, wanting to
avoid the opprobrium that people like the upright Hume direct against
the sensible knave, and to secure their own good self-opinion. In
situations where there are strong expectations and effective
invigilation of cooperative behaviour, the incentives we have to avoid
others&rsquo; opprobrium and think well of ourselves can potentially
be sufficient to prevent us from facing a free rider problem, even
though a group of sensible knaves would face one. However, as Hume
observes and as is experimentally confirmed, this incentive tends to
dissipate as the size of the group increases (Marwell &amp; Ames 1979;
Isaac &amp; Walker 1988).</p>

<p>
At the same time, there is another kind of incentive&nbsp;beyond
narrow self-interest that tends to magnify, not diminish, free rider
problems. This is the incentive not to be (and be seen as) a
&ldquo;sucker&rdquo;&mdash;a contributor on whose contributions others
take a free ride. This incentive has three main manifestations:
aversion to being the object of others&rsquo; derision; shame, when
that self-conception is internalized; and outward-directed resentment
towards the free riders who exploit one&rsquo;s own cooperative
behaviour. In these various forms, aversion to being a sucker can
motivate a reluctance to contribute towards the production of a public
good, independently of whether the expected benefit associated with
contributing outweighs the direct cost of the contribution. This
&ldquo;sucker effect&rdquo; again creates the possibility that even
when the underlying strategic structure does not have
 <a href="#features">features (i)&ndash;(iii)</a>,
 we could still actually face a free rider problem (Bougherara et al.
2009).</p>

<p>
More broadly, it seems that at least six different psychological
factors are involved in determining the strength of the incentives
that potential contributors to collective goods-production will have
not to contribute, and thus whether a free rider problem is produced.
First, there is the positive incentive to gain a material advantage by
avoiding the cost of contribution. Second, there is the negative
incentive not to be a sucker. In the other direction, there is the
restraining influence of pro-cooperative incentives to earn the
positive regard of others and oneself. Then, moderating the influence
of those competing incentives are three further psychological factors:
one&rsquo;s state of knowledge about how one is situated relative to
other agents; one&rsquo;s rationality in assessing the true strategic
structure of the situation; and one&rsquo;s degree of trust in other
agents and institutions&mdash;in other agents&rsquo; cooperative
dispositions, and in institutions&rsquo; reliability in imposing the
positive and negative incentives for cooperation that they have
declared they will impose.</p>

<p>
In experimental social science, situations whose strategic structures
present collective action problems of various kinds have served as a
testing-ground for studies of how these various factors interact to
affect observed patterns of cooperation and non-contribution (Andreoni
1988; Fischbacher &amp; G&auml;chter 2010; Kameda et al. 2011). These
studies can help to inform proposed strategies for solving free rider
problems, to which we will turn in
 <a href="#SolFreRidPro">Section 4</a>.
 It should also be borne in mind that, once we recognize the range of
factors that bear on the contributory incentives of individuals, the
possibility remains open that investigations of social phenomena at a
population-level scale can succeed by applying a &ldquo;rational
choice theory&rdquo; that models those phenomena as the outcomes of
rational self-interested individual choice: this might still turn out
to be a theoretically illuminating simplification for some explanatory
purposes (Eriksson 2011).</p>

<h3 id="PubGoo">3.3 Public Goods</h3>

<p>
The most commonly discussed free rider problems arise in relation to
the production of public goods. Definitions of public goods vary; but
most emphasize one or more of the following eight features:</p>

<ol>

<li>Free Availability: if a public good is available to one member of
the group for which it is public, then it is freely available to each
other member.</li>

<li>Nonexcludability: if anyone is enjoying the good, no one else can
be prevented from freely enjoying it without excessive cost to the
would-be excluders.</li>

<li>Compulsoriness: if anyone receives the good, no-one else can avoid
doing so without excessive cost.</li>

<li>Joint Consumption: one person's consumption of the good does not
diminish the amount available for consumption by anyone else.</li>

<li>Nonrivalness: one person's enjoyment of the good does not diminish
the benefits available to anyone else from its enjoyment.</li>

<li>Equality: if anyone receives the good, everyone receives the same
amount.</li>

<li>Indivisibility: there can be more than one consumer of the good,
and each consumes the total output.</li>

<li>Joint Supply: if the good is being consumed, no extra cost is
required to supply the good to an additional consumer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are entailments between members of this list; but, on the most
straightforward reading of them, no two are
 equivalent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Broadly speaking, these features belong to three main families. The
first three features are refinements of the idea that the good cannot
be supplied to one person without making it available to others; the
next four are refinements of the idea that one person&rsquo;s
consumption of the good does not impinge on others&rsquo; consumption
of it; the last feature (joint supply) concerns the cost of extra
consumption to the supplier of the good, rather than to other
consumers. Paradigm examples of public goods&mdash;street lighting,
national defence, firework displays, lighthouses, clean
air&mdash;possess all three kinds of feature. But it is notable that
features in the first family can be present without features in the
second and third, as in the nonexcludable but rival &ldquo;common pool
goods&rdquo; discussed by Ostrom and Ostrom (1977): for example, fish
stocks in the sea. And features in the second and third families can
be present without features in the first, as in the excludable but
nonrival &ldquo;club goods&rdquo; discussed by Buchanan (1965): for
example, a theatre performance.</p>

<p>
Features of all of these kinds are relevant to the existence and
solubility of free rider problems. Nonexcludability and its cognates
are obviously relevant because of their bearing on whether an
individual can consume the good without contributing to the cost of
producing it; and they also have a bearing on the incentives there may
be to avoid being treated as a sucker by other consumers of the good.
But nonrivalness and its cognates are potentially relevant too. This
can remove the degree of inhibition that may attach to actions that
are perceived to harm others: conceiving of free riding as harmless
may increase a person&rsquo;s propensity to engage in it. And the same
applies to jointness in supply: the perception that one&rsquo;s
additional consumption imposes no extra burden on the producer of a
good may likewise remove a source of reluctance to impose on other
people in taking a good for free.</p>

<p>
The free rider problem is typically discussed as a problem in relation
to the production of public goods: indeed, some discussions build this
connection into the definition of the problem. But that temptation
should be resisted. A private consumption good&mdash;one that has none
of the hallmarks of public goods&mdash;can itself be produced by a
group; and when it is, a free rider problem can arise. For example,
consider a publicly funded scheme of health care provision that is not
charged to the user. Here, since the provision of the good could be
restricted to fee-paying consumers, it is excludable; since the health
care consumed by a particular patient is not available for consumption
by anyone else, it is rival; and since it costs more to treat an extra
patient, it is not in joint supply. However, the incentives there are
to evade the tax contributions that resource the service can still
create a free rider problem. Free rider problems can arise when goods
are collectively produced, whether those goods are themselves public
or private. All that is needed is the perception that one can receive
the good without having contributed to producing it.</p>

<h2 id="SolFreRidPro">4. Solving Free Rider Problems</h2>

<p>
As decision theory teaches, when an agent is presented with the
question what to do, the rationality of their decision is determined
by three main factors: the range of available actions, the different
possible outcomes of those actions and their probabilities, and the
agent&rsquo;s preferences or values. The same factors give us three
basic possibilities for solving a free rider problem.</p>

<p>
The first possibility is to change the available actions. For example,
if we face a Tragedy of the Commons, it may be possible to fence the
commons, thereby removing the possibility of unrestricted use of a
previously free resource.</p>

<p>
The second possibility is to change the possible outcomes of the
available actions, or the probabilities of those outcomes. This is the
Hobbesian solution: by imposing penalties for noncontribution and
making it sufficiently likely that those penalties will be applied, we
can change the agents&rsquo; self-interested calculus so that free
riding is no longer worth the risk. This solution, when it is
available, can often be effective in solving a free rider problem in
its strongest, non-production, manifestation&mdash;where it threatens
to jeopardize our producing a good at all. However, notice that it
really amounts to exchanging one free rider problem for another (more
tolerable) one. Since we are now expending extra resources on
invigilation and deterrent punishment, we are not producing the good
as efficiently as we could have done if we had been sufficiently
motivated to produce it without needing the threat of penalties.</p>

<p>
The third possibility is to change the agents&rsquo; preferences,
without making changes of the first two kinds. We could call this the
Socratic solution, since Socrates&rsquo; reply to his egoistic
challengers, if it worked, would be a solution of this kind. If,
through attaining philosophical insight, we all came to see free
riding as individually bad for us, that could be a way of dissolving
the incentives that create the problem. However, there are also some
other less ambitious possibilities here. Changing the informational
state of the agents, and thereby affecting their trust, could change
their preferences in a pro-cooperative direction. So could spreading
norms that induce shame for behaving like a sensible knave.</p>

<p>
Mapping these three possibilities onto our earlier discussion of the
causes of the free rider problem, the first two possibilities
encompass ways of changing the underlying strategic structure, while
the third covers changes to the psychological factors.</p>

<p>
Since the free rider problem is a problem concerning the incentives
and behaviour of real-world agents, and not merely a strategic
structure in game theory, identifying its potential solutions is a
topic for empirical investigation, rather than game-theoretic
calculation. Two main ongoing bodies of empirical work have advanced
our understanding of the main factors that contribute to facilitating
or obstructing those solutions.</p>

<p>
Within social psychology, there is an extensive body of work
investigating the behaviour of experimental subjects when situated in
conditions that present artificially constructed free rider problems.
Building on the early work of Maximilien Ringelmann (1913),
researchers have sought to measure the &ldquo;Ringelmann
effect&rdquo;&mdash;the observed decrease in productivity of group
members as group size increases&mdash;and to identify variables that
lessen this effect, including goal-setting at the group level,
devising internal competition between group members, and increasing
the exposure of individuals&rsquo; performance to scrutiny by other
group members (Forsyth 2019: Ch. 10). Researchers have also
systematically studied the conditions under which collections of
unaffiliated individuals can be induced to engage in mutually
beneficial cooperation: attempts have been made to measure the effects
of externally imposed sanctions, increased opportunities for
communication, symmetry in the stakes for group members, sequential
decision making, and different levels and types of payoff (Jin et al.
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Turning to political science and sociology, wide-ranging empirical
work has been done to study and explain the social dynamics through
which effective and stable solutions to free rider problems are
created. A central contribution to this field has been made by Elinor
Ostrom and her collaborators in investigating the management of common
pool environmental resources, where there is the potential for
Tragedies of the Commons (Ostrom 1990). According to Ostrom,
self-organizing groups can be effective in solving such problems,
without resorting to either state regulation or private ownership,
when six main conditions are met: reliable information is available to
members of the group about the costs and benefits of different courses
of action; individual group members see maintaining the common
resource as important for their own achievements; group members see
their reputation as a trustworthy reciprocator as important; agents
can communicate with each other; informal monitoring and sanctioning
is feasible and considered appropriate; and social capital and
leadership exist, related to previous successes in solving joint
problems (Ostrom 2010). These conditions are more easily satisfied in
smaller groups with a strong sense of group identity and cultural
cohesion.</p>

<p>
A question this leads to is what prospects there are for finding a
solution to the problem of sustainable resource use on a global scale.
This was a focus of some of Ostrom&rsquo;s later work, which
investigated the interaction between collective action problems at
different scales. She maintained that the evidence supported the view
that global solutions are not impossible, but are only likely to work
well if supported by national, regional and local efforts where the
six features are strongly present (Ostrom 2009, 2010).</p>

<p>
A further body of relevant work in political science investigates the
role of political entrepreneurship as a resource for solving
collective action problems (Laver 1980; Shepsle 2010: Ch. 14). Here,
the interest is in the ways in which, in contexts where powerful
political institutions exist, it can serve the interests of office
holders to be seen as a leader of institutional action that furthers
the interests of those they represent. When it is in the interests of
all group members (including would-be free riders) that public goods
are provided, there can be incentives for political entrepreneurs to
enhance their own political standing by working to steer institutions
in that direction. However, the same dynamics can also lead to the
deployment of political entrepreneurship towards fostering inter-group
conflict (R. Hardin 1995). Here as elsewhere, the dynamics of real
world collective action are complex and nuanced.</p>

<h2 id="FreRidProMorPhi">5. The Free Rider Problem and Moral Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Moral philosophy engages with the free rider problem in two main ways.
One line of enquiry concerns whether morality itself can be understood
as the collection of dispositions and behaviours that we have acquired
that allow us to solve the free rider problem and other related
collective action problems. That is an external line of enquiry: it
looks at morality as a social phenomenon and seeks to explain it by
assigning to it a function&mdash;of solving the collective action
problems we would otherwise succumb to. The second line of enquiry is
internal. It asks, from within moral thought, what the moral
objections to free riding are and to which forms of free riding they
apply.</p>

<h3 id="FunMor">5.1 The Function of Morality?</h3>

<p>
Since Hume, it has routinely been observed that the free rider problem
is easier to solve in smaller groups, and that this is attributable to
the set of dispositions we have to invigilate others&rsquo;
cooperative behaviour, to disapprove of and sanction free riding, and
to seek to avoid others&rsquo; opprobrium and our own shame for
it&mdash;in short, to endorse moral norms that demand cooperative
behaviour of ourselves and others. Together with an appreciation of
the strategic structure that underlies the free rider problem, this
encourages an evolutionary explanation of our pro-cooperative
psychological dispositions. It is to the advantage of every member of
a group that such dispositions and the norms they sustain are
prevalent; so the members of populations containing those dispositions
can be expected to survive and reproduce more readily that those that
lack them. The pro-cooperative dispositions that underlie moral
thought and behaviour are dispositions that we would expect to be
favoured by natural selection.</p>

<p>
This does not detract from the strategic point that being a sensible
knave&mdash;ingratiating oneself sufficiently with others to secure
access to the benefits of cooperation, but being vigilant for
opportunities for advantageous cheating&mdash;can be successful. We
should therefore expect there to be&mdash;as there is&mdash;some
propensity towards free riding behaviour in human populations. But
selection pressures in the evolutionary past can explain the
prevalence of pro-cooperation dispositions.</p>

<p>
(Notice that this presupposes that Hobbes is mistaken. Hobbes does not
want to dispose of morality, but he insists that what theorists of
morality fail to recognize is that moral virtues and vices &ldquo;are
but Conclusions, or Theorems concerning what conduceth to the
conservation and defence of themselves&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em>: Ch.
15 [1996: 111]). If Hobbes is right, there is no need for evolution to
have equipped us with anything in addition to the rational pursuit of
self-interest in order to solve the fearful collective action problem
we face in the absence of cooperation.)</p>

<p>
This then provides the basis for an account of the function of
morality. Evolutionary explanations can support the attribution of
functions to biological structures, dispositions and behaviours,
without requiring that those functions are the result of intentional
design. According to one standard view, an object, structure or
activity has a function when it has an effect within a system that
explains why it exists within that system: going further, Larry Wright
influentially maintains that&nbsp;its having such an effect is its
function (Wright 1973, 1976). On this view, evolutionary explanations
yield biological functions. Following this line of thought, several
philosophers draw the conclusion: facilitating mutually beneficial
cooperation and thereby solving the free rider problem is the function
of morality (Kitcher 2006: 178; Joyce 2006: 208; Prinz 2007: 32;
Sinclair 2012: 14).</p>

<p>
This line of argument invites questions of three main kinds: debate
over them is ongoing. The first concerns the structure of the
biological explanation. It is very plausible that pro-cooperative
dispositions in humans are non-accidental, and that selection
pressures favour those dispositions. However, the structure of that
explanation is contested. A major point of contention concerns whether
selective pressures operating at the level of the group are needed to
explain the transmission of pro-cooperative dispositions. The free
rider problem is cited by some philosophers of biology against the
view that this can be accounted for by individual selection alone:
what is in the interests of the individual is to live in a group in
which others&rsquo; cooperation confers benefits on all group members,
while exploiting opportunities to take advantage of this without
contributing oneself (Richerson et al. 2016). But others argue that
in-group dynamics in small-group contexts can suffice to explain the
emergence of cooperative dispositions and norms while restricting the
target of natural selection to the individual, not the group (Sterelny
2016).</p>

<p>
The second set of questions concerns the inference from the etiology
of pro-social dispositions to a conclusion concerning the function of
morality. The Larry Wright view of functions, reducing a function to
an effect that explains why something exists, can itself be questioned
(Boorse 1976). It can also be questioned whether, from an explanation
that appeals to the environmental pressures that existed in the
evolutionary past, we can make a good inference to the current
function of morality (Smyth 2017). And, beyond this, questions can be
raised about the narrowness of the conception of morality that is
involved in identifying morality with the behaviours and attitudes
supporting cooperation: in particular, morality as it is usually
conceived of includes expressions of concern for others&rsquo; welfare
(for example, in compassion for the weak) and respect for their
independent agency (for example, in norms of non-interference) that
resist straightforward identification with forms of mutually
beneficial cooperation (Cullity 2018).</p>

<p>
Suppose that questions of those first two kinds can be satisfactorily
resolved, and there is a good argument for identifying the function of
morality with facilitating mutually beneficial cooperation. The third
kind of question that then arises is: what follows from that? In
particular, can we draw any conclusions about the content of morality
from a theory of its function? Surely, there are morally better and
worse forms of cooperative human endeavour. For any given instance of
mutually beneficial cooperation by the members of a group, the
question &ldquo;Is this form of cooperation morally good, bad or
indifferent?&rdquo; can be intelligibly asked, and it is not clear how
a theory of the etiologically-generated function of morality is going
to constrain the available answers. To be clear, this is not itself an
objection to the functional thesis&mdash;it is a question about
whether that thesis carries any normative moral implications.</p>

<h3 id="MorEvaFreRid">5.2 The Moral Evaluation of Free Riding</h3>

<p>
We began by distinguishing two main manifestations of the free rider
problem: the free riding manifestation and the non-production
manifestation. In each of these manifestations, it raises a
significant question that is internal to morality.</p>

<p>
First, consider paradigm cases of free riding on the production of a
public good. When the good that a free rider enjoys but does not pay
for is nonrival, no one else is made any worse off by the free
rider&rsquo;s consumption of the good. If so, the following question
arises: since free riding in these circumstances is harmless, why is
it wrong? What moral objection can be raised against it?</p>

<p>
A first kind of answer is that there may not be any actual harm, but
there is still an expectation of harm associated with the free
rider&rsquo;s action&mdash;in the sense that the weighted average of
the possible harms associated with the action is greater than zero.
After all, as the number of free riders increases, so does the average
burden on the diminishing number of contributors, who are sharing the
cost of producing the good. However, in a large group, any such
expectation of harm associated with the difference between one
individual&rsquo;s consuming the good without contributing and their
not consuming without contributing will be very small&mdash;especially
if the already-produced good is in joint supply, and the free rider is
unlikely to be making a difference to others&rsquo; behaviour. And
carrying some small expectation of harm does not seem sufficient to
make an action morally wrong&mdash;most morally innocuous actions do
so.</p>

<p>
Instead, the answer that is commonly given is that what makes free
riding wrong is that it is unfair (Cullity 1995, 2008). The complaint
it invites is not &ldquo;Why have you made us worse off?&rdquo; but
&ldquo;Why have you arrogated to yourself a privilege that you rely on
others&rsquo; not taking?&rdquo; If this is indeed a sound moral
criticism that can be made of free riding on the production of
nonrival public goods, then it apparently furnishes an objection to
welfarism&mdash;the view that the sole determinant of an
action&rsquo;s rightness or wrongness is its actual or potential
impact on others&rsquo; welfare.</p>

<p>
A major point of contention then concerns how far a criticism of this
kind can properly extend. In particular, can it ever be properly
directed against those who do not contribute towards the production of
compulsory goods&mdash;goods that one cannot avoid receiving once they
have been produced? As is explained in
 <a href="#FreRidProPolPhi">&sect;6</a>
 below, that issue seems to be of great importance in determining
whether a plausible foundation can be found for political obligation
in an anti-free riding principle of fairness.</p>

<p>
We can turn now to the non-production manifestation of the free rider
problem&mdash;that is, the problem we have when our reluctance to pay
for public goods results in the failure to produce them
altogether&mdash;or, in a Tragedy of the Commons case, in the
exhaustion of a common resource through unconstrained use. Here, it is
harder to see how any non-contributor treats anyone else unfairly, if
all alike are non-contributors. The question &ldquo;Why have you
arrogated to yourself a privilege that you rely on others&rsquo; not
taking?&rdquo; no longer applies: there is no free riding, and no
apparent unfairness. Is there moral wrongness of any other kind? It
becomes hard to see how that can be true if no one is in a position to
raise a complaint against anyone else&rsquo;s treatment of them. This
raises an interesting possibility. Perhaps, in the non-production
manifestation of the free rider problem, our reluctance to behave
cooperatively could produce a catastrophe for everyone, without
anyone&rsquo;s having done anything morally wrong.</p>

<p>
However, although that seems to be a theoretical possibility, it is
not so clear that it is true of real-life Tragedies of the Commons.
Suppose that the popular speculation about the Easter Islanders were
right, and they did indeed exhaust their natural resources and thereby
destroy their own
 civilization.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Then none of the unconstrained resource-users would have had a
complaint against any other. However, while this point would apply to
all those generations of Easter Islanders who were unconstrained
resource users, it would not apply to the last generation. They would
have an unfairness complaint against the preceding generations, of a
different kind&mdash;not a complaint that the previous generations
were free riding on the contributions of the last generation, but
instead a complaint that those previous generations took more than
their fair share of a resource pool that, had it been managed
sustainably, could have continued to supply them. This complaint will
typically apply in any temporally drawn-out Tragedy of the Commons
case, as a complaint that can be raised by those who have been
deprived of a resource by others&rsquo; unrestricted use of it. And it
apparently applies in the case of global climate change, which as we
saw is worse than a Tragedy of the Commons.</p>

<h2 id="FreRidProPolPhi">6. The Free Rider Problem and Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
We surveyed above some of the most prominent work in political science
bearing on the causes and solutions of free rider problems. There are
three further topics in normative political philosophy on which the
free rider problem has a prominent bearing.</p>

<h3 id="ValSta">6.1 The Value of the State</h3>

<p>
Through exercising its power to constrain us and to coordinate (and
compel) the pooling of our resources to facilitate the production of
important goods, the agency of the state can play an important role as
a source of public goods. Some such goods must apparently be provided
by the state if we are to possess them at all&mdash;for example, the
impartial enforcement of public order, criminal justice, and safety
and environmental regulation. For others, the power of an effective
state is required, given the existence of other states&mdash;for
example, national defence. And for a broader class of further goods,
they are more efficiently provided by the state than they are
privately&mdash;for example, some forms of public infrastructure
(e.g.,
 lighthouses).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This encourages the public goods theory of the value of the state,
according to which the primary justification for the existence of the
state comes from its welfare-enhancing role in solving the free rider
problem and securing for us the benefits of the large-scale
cooperation it would otherwise be difficult to secure (Baumol 1952;
for discussion, see R. Hardin 1997). This can be thought of as
essentially a normative supplementation of Hobbes&rsquo;s explanatory
theory. Hobbes&rsquo;s claim is that, in sustaining civil order by
supplying incentives that solve a free rider problem, the state serves
everyone&rsquo;s interests. The public goods theory generalizes this
claim beyond civil order (a constraint case) to a range of further
resource contribution cases, and then adds a value claim to
Hobbes&rsquo;s explanatory one.</p>

<p>
However, two issues that theories of this kind raise are worth noting.
First, is it really true that absolutely everyone is better off living
under the authority of a state? Don&rsquo;t the Sentinelese get by
satisfactorily without one? Don&rsquo;t some warlords thrive under
circumstances of government collapse? And isn&rsquo;t it credible that
some self-reliant Idaho backwoodsmen really would be better off, on
balance, with no government provision and no government exaction?
Pressing this further, it can be emphasized by skeptics that what is
in question is not simply whether the goods and services provided by
the state are worth the money extracted to pay for them. The relevant
question is whether all of the costs of living under the authority of
the state are outweighed by the benefits it produces&mdash;where those
costs include the loss of freedom entailed by subjection to the
authority of the state, and the loss of self-determination and
self-reliance entailed by the provision of compulsory goods. And
beyond this, the more pressing justificatory question that arises for
the inhabitants of most states is not whether to have a state at all;
it is which of the various possible states we should have, and which
public goods we should produce, in what way. Here, it is clear that
there is no candidate that is best for everyone: we face the
battle-of-the-sexes problem described earlier, to which a different
solution is needed.</p>

<p>
The other issue concerns whether a public goods theory of the value of
the state is too narrow. Aren&rsquo;t there other important purposes
that are served by the state, beyond merely serving as a vehicle for
mutual advantage? It can secure the welfare of others&mdash;not only
other humans, but also non-human animals&mdash;who are not potential
parties to mutually advantageous cooperation. And (potentially at
least) it can pursue justice, domestically and internationally.</p>

<h3 id="PolObl">6.2 Political Obligation</h3>

<p>
There has been recurrent interest in the project of grounding
political obligation &ndash; the obligation to recognize and obey the
authority of the political state &ndash; in an anti-free-riding
principle. H.L.A. Hart made this claim of the following principle of
&ldquo;mutuality of restrictions&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according to
rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to
these restrictions when required have a right to a similar submission
from those who have benefited by their submission. (Hart 1955:
185)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Rawls (1964) had began by following Hart in this project, he
later abandoned it (1971: 336&ndash;7). Drawing on Hart&rsquo;s
principle, in A Theory of Justice Rawls refines it as what he dubs the
&ldquo;principle of fairness&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a person is required to do his part as defined by the rules of an
institution when two conditions are met: first, the institution is
just (or fair), that is, it satisfies the two principles of justice;
and second, one has voluntarily accepted the benefits of the
arrangement or taken advantage of the opportunities it offers to
further one's interests. (Rawls 1971 [1999: 96])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rawls claims that the principle of fairness grounds obligations, such
as the obligation to keep one&rsquo;s promises. He distinguishes
duties of political obedience from obligations, and treats them as
having a different source.</p>

<p>
The grounds Rawls had for changing his mind are the ones that
distinguish his principle from Hart&rsquo;s. The benefits conferred by
the state are compulsory: one cannot (without excessive cost) avoid
receiving them. And the state claims an entitlement to force people to
pay for them. It is these two features that are emphasized by Nozick
(1974: 90&ndash;95) in opposing Hart&rsquo;s proposed grounding for
political obligation. He parodies Hart&rsquo;s principle with examples
of gangs throwing books into people&rsquo;s houses and then demanding
payment, and enthusiasts setting up a public address system to
entertain the neighbourhood and then demanding that others take turns
as disc jockey. When a compulsory benefit is forced onto you, Nozick
argues, there is no unfairness in refusing to pay for it: on the
contrary, it is those trying to extort the payment who act unfairly.
Rawls&rsquo;s formulation, which restricts the obligation to cases in
which a benefit has been voluntarily accepted, avoids these
objections.</p>

<p>
Despite this, there has been a revival of interest in Hart&rsquo;s
project of grounding political obligation in an anti-free-riding
principle. Its defenders have sought to emphasize the differences
between the kind of extortionate behaviour parodied in Nozick&rsquo;s
examples, and the sort of situation in which demanding payment for an
unsolicited benefit seems much more reasonable. If our village is
under threat from tigers, and it is proposed that we all help to
collect wood to build a protective fence, then it seems much more
plausible to claim that my refusal to contribute is unfair. This kind
of case still involves a compulsory benefit, but differs from
Nozick&rsquo;s examples in several significant-looking respects. The
benefit clearly outweighs its cost for each contributor, benefits and
costs are distributed fairly, and the benefit is nonexcludable: it can
only be produced in a way that makes it available to anyone if it is
made available to everyone. Moreover, there is no way of making the
receipt of the benefit voluntary: the protective fence can only be
produced at all if it is produced as a compulsory good, unlike the
goods in Nozick&rsquo;s examples (Arneson 1982; Cullity 1995; Trifan
2000).</p>

<p>
Nozick&rsquo;s critics claim that these differences are significant
because of their relevance to whether it is reasonable to impose
demands for payment on beneficiaries. Their underlying thought is
that, if each of us deliberated with others in good faith about the
principles by which our interaction with each other should be guided,
without claiming special privileges for oneself, we must accept that a
requirement on each of us to contribute to sustaining important public
goods, such as public order and security, is reasonable. It is
unreasonable for anyone to propose that we should go without these
goods when the cost to each of us of sustaining them is relatively
small, and unreasonable to require the cost to be distributed onto
others, exempting oneself. The situation is different in
Nozick&rsquo;s examples: there, it is reasonable to insist that
benefits of these kinds should be made subject to voluntary
agreements.</p>

<p>
If that is true, it keeps open the prospect that political obligations
can be grounded in an anti-free riding principle (Klosko 1991, 2005;
Wolff 1995; Dagger 2000). However, notice that this project requires
defending a further and stronger claim. That I am behaving
unreasonably does not yet justify others in using force against me.
Perhaps the others should simply build their fence and treat me with
Humean disdain as a free rider. To justify the use of coercion, the
train of thought needs to be extended as follows. When a collectively
produced good is important enough, and it is not reasonable to think
that we will succeed in producing it without the use of coercive
sanctions to enforce cooperation, it may be reasonable to adopt a
scheme for producing the good that is backed by such sanctions.
According to the revivers of Hart&rsquo;s project, this is true of
important collective goods secured by the state.</p>

<p>
That line of argument needs much elaboration and supplementation in
order to be convincing. It needs to respond to the objections that the
operation of the state does not qualify as the kind of cooperative
scheme to which a principle of fair contribution properly applies;
that an obligation to contribute does not apply when the question of
which benefits a group should be producing is itself contested; and
that it is not obvious that every citizen to whom claims of political
obligation are addressed does receive a net benefit from the state
(Simmons 1979a, 1979b: Ch. 5). More fundamentally, it is objected that
an argument from reasonable co-deliberation is unpersuasive as an
attempt to establish the legitimacy of using force against those who
prefer to be left alone. Perhaps if I were concerned to join the rest
of the group, that would commit me to standards of reasonableness in
engaging with others. But if I prefer not to associate myself with a
group that claims authority over me, can I not complain that it is
question-begging for them to invoke the terms of reasonable
association within their group as a justification for compelling me to
join in?</p>

<h3 id="ComFreRidPro">6.3 Combatting the Free Rider Problem</h3>

<p>
Whether or not we are attracted to either of those two justificational
projects in political philosophy&mdash;grounding the value of the
state in its efficacy in solving free rider problems to secure public
goods, or grounding political obligations in an anti-free-riding
principle&mdash;there are two further questions that arise for
political philosophy.</p>

<p>
The first is: what measures is it justifiable to take in punishing and
deterring free riding? Again, part of the challenge in answering this
question comes from the distinctive features of nonrival goods. If a
free riding consumer of nonrival goods does not harm anyone else, the
use of coercive measures against the free rider is apparently
precluded by Mill&rsquo;s Harm Principle, on its most straightforward
interpretation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm
to others. (1859 [1991: Ch. 1, p. 14])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This invites the thought: since surely it is legitimate for us to
deter free riding (for example, by punishing tax evasion) this makes
the Harm Principle itself implausible. Perhaps, instead, we can appeal
to the overall potential harm we stand to suffer if free riding goes
unsanctioned. Or, in a bigger departure, we might defend the view that
there are good moral reasons for punishing wrongdoing against other
members of the community, while recognizing in actions such as free
riding the possibility of wrongs that are independent of harms. This
is a topic to be pursued within the theory of punishment.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is this question: what measures is it justifiable for
us to take in compelling contributions towards the stable production
of a new public good? To tackle this, we need to begin by asking
whether the production of the good is worth its full cost, taking into
account both its opportunity cost (in terms of forgoing the other
goods that might have been produced instead with the same resources)
and the cost involved in being subject to coercion. This invites the
earlier skepticism about whether there are any goods for which the
answer to that question will clearly be Yes in relation to every
person who is potentially subject to the coercion. If not, that does
not rule out the possibility of a successful justification, but it
will require a more extensive argument. Intuitively, if the benefit is
widespread enough, and can only be secured by resorting to coercion,
it could be unreasonable for me to object to the generally beneficial
use of coercive means of securing a public good on the grounds that I
do not derive a net benefit myself. The further complication is that,
in a polity where there are strongly held conflicting opinions about
which practices of public goods production are worthwhile, fair
collective decision-making requires us to resolve such disputes
democratically. This then leaves us with the challenge of specifying
and justifying the constraints on simple majoritarian decision-making
that need to be in place before we can justify taking resources off a
dissenting minority group in order to benefit the majority.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
