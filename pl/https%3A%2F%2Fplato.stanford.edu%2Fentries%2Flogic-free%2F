<h1>Free Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Apr 5, 2010; substantive revision Thu Jun 19, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In most general terms, free logic is concerned with names that do not
denote. Classical logic requires each singular term to denote an
object in the domain of quantification &mdash; which is usually understood
as the set of &ldquo;existing&rdquo; objects. Free logic does not.
Free logic is therefore useful for analyzing discourse containing
singular terms that either are or might be empty. Varying conventions
for calculating the truth values of atomic formulas containing empty
singular terms yield three distinct forms of free logic: negative,
positive and neutral, which is why we commonly refer to them as free
logics (in the plural) instead.</p>

<p>
Most free logics have been first-order, their quantifiers ranging over
individuals. Recently, however, some work on higher-order free logics
has appeared. Corine Besson (2009) argues that internalist theories of
natural kinds require second-order free logics whose quantifiers range
over kinds, and she finds precedent for this idea ranging as far back
as Cocchiarella (1986). Andrew Bacon, John Hawthorne, and Gabriel
Uzquiano (2016) explore the possibility of using a higher-order free
logic to resolve certain intensional paradoxes, but they find that
this idea faces daunting difficulties. Timothy Williamson (2016)
reluctantly concurs. This article, however, focuses mainly on
first-order logics.</p>

<p>
Section 1 lays out a brief history and motivation of free logic,
introduces basic definitions and explains how it differs from related
logics. The semantics for the variants of free logics are surveyed in
Section 2. Section 3 presents the proof systems for the three
variants, briefly laying out the axiomatization and then focusing on
the currently favored proof-theoretic approaches. Section 4 is
critical, examining three anomalies that infect most free logics.
Section 5 samples applications of free logic to theories of
description, logics of partial or non-strict functions, logics with
Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics that are in a certain
sense Meinongian.</p>

<h2 id="brief-history-and-motivation">1. Brief History and Motivation</h2>

<p>
A consideration of one question regarding non-denoting names can be
traced back to Aristotle (translation Barnes 1984):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It might, indeed, very well seem that the same sort of thing does
occur in the case of contraries said with combination, &lsquo;Socrates
is well&rsquo; being contrary to &lsquo;Socrates is sick&rsquo;. Yet
not even with these is it necessary always for one to be true and the
other false. For if Socrates exists one will be true and one false,
but if he does not both will be false; neither &lsquo;Socrates is
sick&rsquo; nor &lsquo;Socrates is well&rsquo; will be true if
Socrates himself does not exist at all. (13b11&ndash;20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While this passage possibly anticipates the issues free logics are
concerned with, it was in the 20th century that the modern debate
begins. In the first part of the 20th century, some inquiries were
made into a logic with possibly empty domains, or <em>inclusive</em>
logic (called so because it includes this possibility, Quine
1954), and thus
inquiry is sometimes considered a precursor to the investigations into
free logic. The section 1.2 below discusses the difference between
free and inclusive logics, however.</p>

<p>
Proper modern free logics, as a family of first-order logics, came
about as a result of examining the existence assumptions of classical
logics in the middle of the 20th century (Hintikka
1959; Lambert 1967, 1997, 2001), with the name due to Karel
Lambert, which is short for &ldquo;logic free of existence assumptions
with respect to its terms, singular and general&rdquo; (we&rsquo;ll
tighten up the previously loose talk of &lsquo;names&rsquo; and focus
on terms instead). But since in modern logic there are hardly any
presuppositions with regard to general terms (although there are
naturally some exceptions, like
Besson 2009), the first point will
be the focus of this exposition.</p>

<p>
Consider then the following two arguments.</p>

<p>

\[\frac{\text{Bucephalus is a horse.}}{\because \text{ There exists something that is a horse.}}\]
</p>

<p>
This sounds like a perfectly fine piece of elementary reasoning. But
this is structurally at least <em>very</em> similar to the next
argument:</p>

<p>

\[\frac{\text{Sleipnir does not exist.}}{ \because\text{ There exists something that does not exist.}}\]
</p>

<p>
A useful, albeit artificial, assumption that pervades the standard
approaches to quantified first order logic is that every singular term
denotes an object. Obviously, the second inference is blocked by
limiting singular terms to the denoting ones.</p>

<p>
In opposition to this dismissive response &ldquo; intuitively,
Socrates <em>could have</em> not existed &rdquo; (although,
see possibilism-actualism debate), free logic chooses to alter the
logical rules for Existential Generalization (and related Universal
Specification) by explicitly limiting them to the existence predicate
\({E!}\).</p>

<h3 id="definition-and-variants">1.1 Definition and Variants</h3>

<p>
The definitional hallmarks of a free logic are: (1) it is free of
existential presuppositions with respect to its singular terms, (2) it
is free of existential presuppositions with respect to its general
terms and finally (3) its quantifiers have existential import, or are
more broadly limited to the predicate which delineates the denoting
terms, \({E!}\) (most commonly read as <em>existence</em>, Leonard
1956;
Baaz and Iemhoff 2006; Maffezioli and Orlandelli 2019, and
<em>definedness</em>, Feferman
1995; Antonelli 2000).</p>

<p>
In any case, it is crucial for the understanding of free logic that,
in any of its versions, quantification is limited to the
\(E!\)-predicate; whereas the particular interpretation of this
predicate may vary and, as we shall see later, this predicate does not
need to even have the time honored status of a <em>logical</em>
predicate.</p>

<p>
As stated previously, point (2) does not have any significant bearing
on the discussion, while point (3) represents the limitation of
quantification to \({E!}\). Focusing now on point (1), the question
arises as to the status of atoms containing non-denoting terms, and
what truth status is assigned to them determines the major variants of
free logic.</p>

<p>
<em>Positive</em> FL allows for some atoms with terms outside of
\({E!}\) to remain true (at the very least self-identities). On the
other hand <em>negative</em> FL treats all such atoms as uniformly
false (as was the suggestion in Aristotle&rsquo;s quote above).
Finally <em>neutral</em> FL, assigns a third value to those atoms, and
forms a subfamily of its own, depending on the interpretation of that
third value and/or the meaning and inferential behavior of logical
symbols.</p>

<h3 id="related-systems">1.2 Related Systems</h3>

<h4 id="inclusive-logics">Inclusive Logic</h4>

<p>
Another existence assumption that is frequently employed relates not
to terms but to models &mdash; namely that the domain is non-empty. Logics
which allow for the rejection of this assumption (i.e., allow us to
include the empty domain) are called <em>inclusive</em>. While they
bear a close resemblance to free logics, these two issues are
orthogonal to one another and can be considered in separation. To see
this, it is easy to consider <em>empty logic</em> of Hailperin
(1953),
which contains no singular terms and no elements of the domain. While
obviously inclusive, this logic is not free, since there are no
non-denoting terms. The converse case of free non-inclusive logics is
easily obtained by additionally specifying this via the addition of
the following rule to any of the free logics below:</p>

<p>

\[\frac{{E!} t, \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta} \text{NI, t fresh}\]
</p>

<p>
This is standardly taken to be the case with free logics, so this rule
can be assumed to be added to the systems discussed below.</p>

<h4 id="classicalintuitionistic-logic">Classical/Intuitionistic Logic</h4>

<p>
While most of the presentation here centers on the free logics arising
form the extension of classical propositional base, considerable work
has also gone into investigation of those with intuitionistic bases.
Considerations discussed below apply, <em>mutatis mutandis</em> also
for those bases. In either case the simplest way of obtaining a
non-free logic from a free one is simply the addition of the rule</p>

<p>

\[\frac{{E!} t, \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}\text{NI}^+\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that in contrast to the previous version of the rule which
required an <em>arbitrary</em> term be used, any term can be used
here. Therefore, in effect this rule eliminates non-denoting terms (it
states, read bottom up, that in any proof search we may add the
assumption a term denotes). Important to note is that the
intuitionistic version of the rule contains at most one formulas in
\(\Delta\), but is otherwise of the same form.</p>

<h4 id="quasi-free-logics">Quasi-free Logic</h4>

<p>
While the name is recent and due to Indrzejczak
(2021a), the logics of
these type have been considered for a while, with the most notable
example the Logic of Partial Terms (Feferman
1995). This logic lies
somewhere between classical (<em>mutatis mutandis</em>,
intuitionistic) and free logics by, in effect, adding the rule
NI\(^+\) for singular terms, but remaining free for functional
expressions. Feferman specifically discusses a negative free
extension, but a useful overview of multiple versions (and their
uniform cut elimination) is available in (Indrzejczak
2021a).</p>

<h3 id="language-of-free-logic">1.3 Language of Free logic</h3>

<p>
For the formal presentation of free logics we utilize the language
\(\mathcal{L}\), a standard first-order language (without functions),
adapted from (Gratzl
2010), with the vocabulary defined as</p>

<div class="definition">

<p>
<strong>Definition 1</strong> (Alphabet \(\mathcal{L}\)). <em>The
alphabet</em> of the language \(\mathcal{L}\) consists of:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Denumerable list of free individual variables (names):
\(a,b,c,\ldots\),</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
Denumerable list of bound individual variables:
\(x,y,z,\ldots\),</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
Denumerable list of \(n\)-ary predicate variables, including a
unary predicate \({E!}\) and a binary predicate \(=\),</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
\(\neg\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\to\), \(\forall\), \(\exists\),
\((\), \()\).</p> </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
A <em>formula</em> of \(\mathcal{L}\) is then defined as</p>

<div class="definition">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2</strong> (Formula of \(\mathcal{L}\)).</p>

\[A::= P^{n}(\bar{t_{1}},...,\bar{t_{n}})\ |\ \neg A\ |\ A\circ A\ |\ \forall x A\ |\ \exists x A\]

<p>
where \(\circ \in \{\wedge, \vee, \to\}\).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Sem">2. Formal Semantics for Free Logics</h2>

<p>
In this section we lay out common semantical approaches to free
logics. We commence with a formal presentation of the three
(well-studied) semantical approaches for positive and negative free
logic.</p>

<h3 id="meinongian-semantics">2.1 Meinongian Semantics</h3>

<p>
The <em>inner-outer domain</em>, or <em>Meinongian</em> semantics, has
been devised to study meta-theoretical properties of positive free
logic. The main ingredients for it are a structure and a valuation,
laid out in the following two definitions:</p>

<div class="definition" id="defvaluationVm1">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3</strong> (Meinongian structure
\(\mathcal{S}_{m}\)). A <em>Meinongian structure</em> \(\mathcal{S}_{m}\)
is a triple \(\langle\cD_i, \cD_o, \varphi\rangle\),
where the following conditions are met:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
\(\cD_i, \cD_o\) are sets, with \(\cD_i\) the
inner domain, thought of as the set of existents, and \({\mathcal
D}_o\) the outer domain, thought of the set of non-existents. Both
\(\cD_i\), and \(\cD_o\) can possibly be empty, however:
\(\cD_i \cup \cD_o \not = \varnothing\), and \(\cD_i \cap \cD_o =
\varnothing\).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
\(\varphi(E!) = \cD_i\).</p> </li>

<li>

<p class="nobottommargin">
Let \(\cD\) be the union of \(\cD_i\) and
\(\cD_o\), then:</p>

<ul class="hanging dense notopmargin">
<li>&bull;&nbsp;
For every free individual variable \(t\): \(\varphi(t) \in
\cD\).</li>

<li>&bull;&nbsp;
For every \(n\)-ary predicate \(P^n\): \(\varphi(P^n) \subseteq
\cD^n\).</li>

<li>&bull;&nbsp;
Every object in \(\cD\) has a name in the formal
language, i.e. if \(d \in \cD\), then \(d^\bullet\) (the
standard-name of \(d\)) is in the language.</li></ul>
 </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="definition" id="defvaluationVm">

<p>
<strong>Definition 4</strong> (Meinongian Valuation \({\mathcal
V}^{m}\)). <em>The truth-value assignment</em> \({\mathcal V}^{m}\) on the
structure \(\mathcal{S}_m\) is defined as</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
\(\notag {\mathcal V}^{m}({E!} t)= \begin{cases}
\top, &amp; \text{if}\ \varphi(t) \in \cD_i\\
 \bot, &amp; \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}\)
</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
\(\notag {\mathcal V}^{m}(P^{n}(t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}))= \begin{cases}
\top, &amp; \text{if}\ \langle \varphi(t_{1}),\ldots,\varphi(t_{n})\rangle\in \varphi(P^{n})\\

</div>

<h3 id="supervaluational-semantics">2.2 Supervaluational Semantics</h3>

<p>
The supervaluational approach to semantics offers means for reducing
three-valued semantics to a positive one. It is more involved, but has
some advantages over Meinongian semantics given that it does not make
use of an outer-domain, which can be viewed as ontologically dubious.
The price for this is at least more formal complexity and, furthermore
that meta-theoretically it is not compact in the sense of the
compactness theorem; more on this in Example 2 and remark. The
approach of fully retaining three-valued semantics is explored in the
section on neutral free logic later in this section.</p>

<p>
One of the goals of supervaluational semantics is to save the laws of
classical logic, such as \(A\vee \neg A\), \(\neg(A \wedge \neg A)\)
while preserving the spirit of free logic, that is allowing for empty
singular terms and quantification which is tied to the
\(E!\)-predicate. This is achieved by setting up a multi-stage
process, that commences with the following definition:</p>

The remaining definitional clauses for the Boolean cases and
existentially quantified formulas follow as usual. Now with this at
hand, we can define a <em>supervaluation</em> \(\sigma\) which is
based on a stage-1 structure and its stage-2 superstructures; in order
to indicate the dependence of \(\sigma\) with respect to \({\mathcal
V}^{s1}\), we write \(\sigma_{{\mathcal V}^{s1}}\), and define:</p>

<div class="definition" id="supval">

\(A\) is not in the domain of \(\sigma_{{\mathcal V}^{s1}}(A)\)
otherwise, i.e. there is a stage-2 structure over a stage-1 structure

over a stage-1 structure with \({\mathcal V}^{s2}(A) =
\bot\).</p> </li>

Since this semantics is more complicated we define core semantical
notions in detail and provide some examples.</p>

<div class="definition">

<p>
<strong>Definition 10</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
A formula \(A\) is <em>logically true</em>, or <em>logically
supertrue</em> iff for all \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structures with
\(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}^{s1}}(A) = \top\).</p>

<p>
A formula \(A\) is <em>logically false</em>, or <em>logically superfalse</em> iff

<p>
A formula \(A\) is a <em>logical consequence</em> of a set of formulas
\(\Gamma\), or \(A\) is a <em>logical superconsequence</em> of \(\Gamma\)
\((\Gamma \models A)\) iff for all \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structures: if
\(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}^{s1}}(B) = \top\), for all \(B \in \Gamma\),
then \(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}^{s1}}(A) = \top\).</p> </li>

<li>

A set of formulas \(\Gamma\) is <em>satisfiable</em>, or <em>supersatisfiable</em>

A formula \(A\) is <em>contingent</em>, or <em>supercontigent</em>
iff (1) there is
a \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structure with \(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}^{s1}}(A) =
\top\) and a (2) there is a \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structure with
\(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}^{s1}}(A) = \bot\). </p> </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Next we offer several examples as a way of elaborating on these
definitions.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex2">

<p>
<strong>Example 2</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
\(\exists x(x = a)\) is not logically true.</p>

<p>
Let there be a \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structure such that \(a\) is
not in the domain of \(\varphi\); the result follows.</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
\(P(a) \models \exists xP(x)\).</p>

<p>
According to our definition of logical superconsequence, \(\exists
xP(x)\) follows from \(P(a)\) just in case for all
\(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structures: if \(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}_{s1}}(P(a))
= \top\), then \(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}_{s1}}(\exists xP(x)) =
\top,\)&nbsp;now plugging in the clause 1 of Definition 9 we obtain:
just in case for all \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structures: if \({\mathcal
V}^{s2}(P(a)) = \top\) for every completion \(\mathcal{S}_{s2}\) of
\(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\), then \({\mathcal V}^{s2}(\exists xP(x) ) =
\top\) for every completion \(\mathcal{S}_{s2}\) of
\(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\).</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
\(P(a) \to \exists xP(x)\) is not logically (super-)true.</p>

<p>
Suppose that \(P(a) \to \exists xP(x)\) is logically (super-)true,
i.e. for all \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\) structures,
\(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}_{s1}}(P(a) \to \exists xP(x)) = \top\), just in
case \({\mathcal V}^{s2}(P(a) \to \exists xP(x))=\top\) for all
\(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}_{s2}}\) over \(\sigma_{\mathcal{S}_{s1}}\).
There is a valuation \({\mathcal V}^{s1}\) such that \({\mathcal
V}^{s1}\) is not defined for \(P(a)\), so \({\mathcal V}^{s1}(E!a) =
{\mathcal V}^{s1}(P(a)) = \bot\), and the desired result
follows.</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
\(\forall xE!x\) is logically (super-)true.</p>

<p>
\({\mathcal V}^{s2}(\forall xE!x) = \top\) for all
\(\mathcal{S}_{s2}\) structures over \(\mathcal{S}_{s1}\), since:
either \({\mathcal V}^{s2}(E!d^\bullet) = \top\) or \({\mathcal
V}^{s2}(E!d^\bullet) = \bot\) for all \(d^\bullet\). However, for both
cases in by definition
 <a href="#defvaluationVst2">8</a>
 clause 7: \({\mathcal V}^{s2} (\forall xE!x) = \top\).</p> </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Some remarks about the above examples are in order.</p>

<p>
(1) Items 2 and 3 show that strong completeness is not available for
logical superconsequence, and with it that compactness fails.</p>

<p>
(2) As the previous example highlights the logical consequence
relation used in supervaluational semantics is <em>global</em> as
opposed to the more usual <em>local</em>. Local consequence states
that \(\Gamma\) entails \(A\) just in case every model that makes all
of \(\Gamma\) true, likewise makes \(A\) true &mdash; the quantifier takes
the wide scope. By contrast, global consequence states that if every
model makes all of \(\Gamma\) true, then every model makes \(A\) true
-the implication takes the wide scope instead.</p>

<h3 id="generalized-semantics">2.4 Generalized Semantics</h3>

<p>
The approach of utilizing <em>generalized semantics</em> was
introduced by Pavlovi&#263;
and Gratzl (2021) to facilitate meta-theory. In a nutshell, the
idea of this approach is that for the proofs of soundness and
completeness, a <em>description</em> of a model, rather than a
full-blown model, will suffice. This allows for a simplified
presentation of semantics (eschewing partial functions) and, given that
it has a greater level of generality, can be applied to different
particular semantic approaches. Great use of this feature of
generalized semantics was made to offer a uniform picture of a variety
of positive and negative free logics.</p>

propositionally classical while incorporating free quantification.</p>

A similar investigation is offered for neutral free logics based on
strong (Kleene

identity-free segment.</p>

<p>
Even though there are multiple possible neutral free logics, there is
good reason to see it as a single kind of logic, since the treatment
of quantifiers does not vary between these interpretations, and the

used.</p>

When it comes to supervaluations of this generalized semantics, a
completion of a neutral structure, \(\varphi '\), is identical to
\(\varphi\) it completes, except that \(\varphi'(P^n) \subseteq
\varphi'(D)\) (therefore making it a positive structure) such that
\(\varphi(P^n) \subseteq \varphi'(P^n)\), and the valuations for atoms
do not contain the case for \(+\) (thus making it moot for logical
symbols).</p>

<p>
We again offer several examples, to illustrate both the functioning of
the two systems, and also their differences.</p>

<div class="example">

<p>
<strong>Example 4</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
\(\forall x {E!} x\) is valid in both weak and strong models;
proof, same as in Example 2, follows immediately from the valuation
for \({E!}\).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
 \(\forall x Px \to P(a)\) is always non-false (so <em>tolerantly
valid</em>) under either valuation, although not always true (so not
<em>strictly valid</em>) (for more on strict and tolerant validity,
see (Cobreros et al.
2012)).</p>

<p>
If \(P(a)\) is false, then \({E!} a\) is true, and therefore
\(\forall x P(x)\) is false. However, if \({E!} a\) is false, this
formula is third-valued under weak valuation, and either third-valued
(if \(\forall x P(x)\) is true) or true (if \(\forall x P(x)\) is
false) under the strong evaluation.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>\(\forall x P(x) \to ({E!} a \to P(a))\) is true under the strong
evaluation.</p>

<p>
\({E!} a\) is crisp, meaning it is always true or false. If false,
\({E!} a \to P(a)\) is true and the whole formula is true. If true,
then \(P(a)\) is either true or false. In the former case \({E!} a \to
P(a)\) is true and the whole formula is true. In the latter case,
\(\forall x P(x)\) is false and the whole formula is again
true.</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
\(\forall x P(x) \to ({E!} a \to P(a))\) is merely non-false under
the weak evaluation.</p>

<p>
If \({E!} a\) is true, the reasoning is the same as in the
previous point. But if it is false, the whole formula is
third-valued.</p> </li>

<h2 id="formal-proofs">3. Formal Proof Systems for Free Logics</h2>

<p>
Traditional presentation of proof-systems for free logic has more
often been in Hilbert, or axiom, style and due to this historical fact
we first introduce some formalizations of variants of free logic by
using this style. However, further types of proof systems have been
developed which facilitated fruitful research in this area; so, most
of this section is devoted to these more useful proof systems. Before
stating systems for Hilbert-style calculi of free logic, we recall
such a system for classical logic.&nbsp; It and the rest of the
systems presented here are formulated in a first-order language
\(\bL\) without sentence letters or function symbols, whose primitive
logical operators are negation (not) &lsquo;\({\neg}\)&rsquo;, the
conditional (if-then) &lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo;, the universal
quantifier (for all) &lsquo;\(\forall\)&rsquo;, identity
&lsquo;=&rsquo; and &lsquo;E!&rsquo;, the others being defined as
usual. We assume for the sake of definiteness that the formulas of
\(\bL\) are closed (contain no unquantified variables) and that they
may be vacuously quantified (have the form \(\forall xA\) or \(\exists
xA\), where \(x\) does not occur free in \(A)\). An occurrence of a
variable is <em>quantified</em> if it lies within the scope of an
operator such as &lsquo;\(\forall\)&rsquo; or
&lsquo;\(\exists\)&rsquo; that binds that variable; otherwise it is
<em>free</em>. Each axiom system has <em>modus ponens</em> as the sole
rule of inference.</p>

<p>
<strong>Some theorems. </strong> We exhibit some interesting theorems
of free logic, beginning with with positive free logic and
<em>Hintikka's Law</em>: \(E!s \leftrightarrow \exists x(x = s)\) The
proof from left to right is straightforward:</p>

<div class="indent">
\[\begin{align}
\tag*{1.} &amp;\forall x\neg(x = t) \to (E!t \to \neg(x= t) ) &amp;\text{[from P4]} \\
\tag*{2.} &amp;t = t &amp;\text{[from P6]} \\
\tag*{3.} &amp;t = t \to (E!t \to \neg \forall x \neg (x = t)) &amp;\text{[from 1 by logic]} \\
\tag*{4.} &amp;E!t \to \neg \forall x \neg (x = t) &amp;\text{[from 2,3 by MP]}
\end{align}\]
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, the proof from right to left is slightly more
convoluted:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\tag*{ 1.} &amp;s=t \to (E!s \to E!t)  &amp;\text{[from P5]} \\
\tag*{ 2.} &amp;\forall x((x = t) \to (E!x \to E!t)) &amp;\text{[from 1, P7]} \\
\tag*{ 3.} &amp;\forall x(\neg E!t \to (E!x \to \neg (x =t))) &amp;\text{[from 2 by logic]} \\
\tag*{ 4.} &amp;\forall x\neg E!t \to \forall x(E!x \to \neg (x =t)) &amp;\text{[from 3,P2 by logic]} \\
\tag*{ 5.} &amp;\neg E!t \to \forall x \neg E!t &amp;\text{[from P3]} \\
\tag*{ 6.} &amp;\neg E!t \to \forall x(E!x \to \neg (x =t)) &amp;\text{[from 4,5 by logic]} \\
\tag*{ 7.} &amp;\forall x (E!x \to \neg (x=t)) \\
   &amp;\qquad \to (\forall xE!x \to \forall x\neg (x=t)) &amp;\text{[from P2]} \\
\tag*{ 8.} &amp;\forall xE!x \to (\forall x(E!x \to \neg (x=t)) \\
   &amp;\qquad \to \forall x \neg (x=t)) &amp;\text{[from 7,P2 by logic]} \\
\tag*{ 9.} &amp;\forall xE!x &amp;\text{[from P8]} \\
\tag*{ 10.} &amp;\forall x(E!x \to \neg (x=t)) \to \forall x \neg (x=t) &amp;\text{[from 8,9 by MP]} \\
\tag*{ 11.} &amp;\neg E!t \to \forall x\neg x=t &amp;\text{[from 6,10 by logic]} \\
\tag*{ 12.} &amp;\exists x (x=t) \to E!t &amp;\text{[from 11 by logic]}
\end{align}\]

<p>
Now moving to negative free logic, we have the stronger claim of</p>

\[ E!t \leftrightarrow t = t\tag{E!-SI equivalence} \]

<p>
as a theorem, since: \(E!t \to t = t\) is an axiom of type N6, and
\(t= t \to E!t\) an axiom of type N9.</p>

<p>
In contrast to positive free logic, NFL also proves the
<em>indiscernibility of non-existents</em>:</p> 
\[ \neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t \to (P[s] \to P[t])\tag{Indiscernability of non-E!} \]

<div class="indent">
\[\begin{align}
\tag*{1.} &amp;P[s] \to E!s &amp;\text{[from N9]} \\
\tag*{2.} &amp;P[s] \wedge \neg P[t] \to E!s \vee E!t &amp;\text{[from 1 by logic]} \\
\tag*{3.} &amp;\neg (P[s] \to P[t]) \to \neg (\neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t) &amp;\text{[from 2 by logic]} \\
\tag*{4.} &amp;\neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t \to (P[s] \to P[t]) &amp;\text{[from 3 by logic]}
\end{align}\]
</div>

<p>
Moreover, indiscernibility of non-existents generalizes to \(\neg E!s
\wedge \neg E!t \to (A[s] \to A[t])\) by induction on the complexity of
\(A\).</p>

<p>
Clearly this formula is not a theorem of PFL as an application of the
soundness theorem shows: let's construct a Meinongian structure with
\(D_i = \varnothing,\) and \(D_o = \{0, 1\}\) with \(\varphi(s) = 0,\)
and \(\varphi(t) = 1,\) and \(\varphi(P) = \{0\}.\) Then \({\mathcal
V}(\neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t \to (P[s] \to P[t])) = \bot,\) and so PFL
\(\not \vdash \neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t \to (P[s] \to P[t]).\)</p>

<p>
Finally, that truth implies the existential claim likewise holds in
negative free logic:</p> 
\[ P(s) \to \exists xP(x)\tag{TIEx}\]

<div class="indent">
\[\begin{align}
\tag*{1.} &amp;E!s \to (P(s) \to \exists xP(x)) &amp;\text{[from N4 by logic]} \\
\tag*{2.} &amp;P(s) \to E!s &amp;\text{[from N9]} \\
\tag*{3.} &amp;P(s) \to \exists xP(x) &amp;\text{[from 1,3 by logic]}
\end{align}\]
</div>
<p>
<strong>Collapse into classical logic.</strong> It is quite
instructive to ask what happens if positive and negative free logic
are combined. Semantically, given 
 <a href="#defvaluationVm1">Definition 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#russell">Definition 11</a> 
 and their respective valuations, the answer might be
elusive. However, just like with the generalized semantics,
syntactically the answer is straightforward. So, the axioms and rules
of inference are as for PFL and NFL taken jointly.</p>

<p>
\(E!t \to (\forall x A \to A)\) follows from axiom 3 and logic, in the
light of NFL-theorem \(E!t \leftrightarrow t = t\), we obtain: \(t=t
\to (\forall x A \to A)\) so by PFL axiom P6, the desired result, i.e.
\(\forall x A \to A\) follows.</p>

<p>
(This equivalence is sometimes taken as a definition of \(E!t\).)
Identity statements in negative free logic thus have existential
implications. This may be problematic in certain contexts. According
to Shapiro and Weir (2000), for example, use of such an
&ldquo;existential&rdquo; notion of identity sullies the
&ldquo;epistemic innocence&rdquo; of some recent efforts to base
neo-logicist philosophies of mathematics on free logic.</p>

<h3 id="Q_SC">3.2 Quantified Sequent Calculi</h3>

<p>
Most of the recent representations of a proof system for free logics
has been in the form of sequent calculi. These approaches are favored
for their transparency arising from locality &mdash; all the relevant
information for evaluating an inference step is contained locally at
within the point of application, as well as modularity &mdash; extensions do
not alter the properties of the base system. For an overview of proof
theory in general see the entry on 
 <a href="../proof-theory/">proof theory</a>,
 and for its history and the modern developments we utilize here see
 the entry on <a href="../proof-theory-development/">the development of proof theory</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The basic unit of a sequent calculus is a <em>sequent</em> \(\Gamma
\Rightarrow \Delta\), where \(\Gamma\) and \(\Delta\) are finite
multisets of (closed) formulas, intuitively understood as ``if
everything left of the arrow holds, then something on the right of the
arrow holds''. All the formulas except \(\Gamma\) and \(\Delta\) in
the schematic presentation below are called <em>active</em> formulas
of the rule if they occur only in the upper sequent(s) and
<em>principal</em> if they occur in the lower sequent of the rule.</p>

<p>
In this section we will present the sequent calculi for the bivalent
positive and negative free logics with and without identity. The base
is the classical propositional calculus G3cp:</p>

<p>
<strong>Initial sequent:</strong> \(P,\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta, P\),
where \(P\) is prime</p>

<div class="avoid-break">

 &amp;&amp;\\
 \frac{A [ t/x], \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{\exists x A , \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta} L\exists^* &amp;&amp; \frac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta, \exists x A, A[ t/x]}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta, \exists x A} R \exists

To add identity, we extend two more rules, for reflexivity of identity
(Ref) and the replacement principle (Repl):</p>

<div class="avoid-break">
<p>
<strong>Identity rules:</strong></p>

<p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{t=t,\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta }{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta} =_{Ref} &amp;&amp; \frac{s=t, P[s], P[t], \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{s=t, P[t], \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta} =_{Repl}

<p class="center">

<p>
The replacement rule is defined only for primes, but it suffices to
prove all instances of replacement, so no generality is lost here. At
the same time, the rule as presented has a geometric form, which means
that its addition in the present form will be modular, not upsetting
the properties of the base. All of these rules taken together
constitute what is most commonly thought of as G3c.</p>

This substitution will suffice to demonstrate two axioms which
characterize free logic, of Restricted generalization (RG) and
Restricted specification (RS):</p>

and the second to the rule L\(\forall\). RG states that (free)
quantifiers apply to all, and RS that they apply only to, the
instances of \({E!}\). By contrast, the principle of Unrestricted
specification holds for classical FOL, but not free logics:</p>

<p>

\[\forall x A\to A[t/x] \tag{US}\]
</p>

<p>
One can easily see that this will not be derivable using the free
rules due to the presence of the extra condition \(E! t\) in the
conclusion of the rule.</p>

<p>
These observations on the functioning of the quantifier rules will
hold for both positive free logic and negative free logic, but the
latter needs to be distinguished by further modifications we outline
in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="NFL_SC">3.4 Negative Free Logic</h3>

<p>
To obtain a sequent calculus G3nf for negative free logic, we extend
the propositional base of G3cp with the free quantifier rules, much
like in the positive case (hence the observations of the previous
section still hold), but instead of the standard identity rules we add
the following relational rules:</p>

<p>
<strong>Relational rules:</strong></p>

<p>

\[
\frac{{E!} t, P[t], \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta}{P[t], \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta}{E!} \qquad \frac{t=t, P[t], \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta}{P[t], \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta} =_{Ref}
\]

\[
\frac{s=t, P[s], P[t], \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{s=t, P[t], \Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}=_{Repl}
\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that the rule for reflexivity of identity has been weakened,
now to apply only to terms occurring within atoms. Since the rule for
\(E!\) is similarly restricted, we get that \(E! t\) iff \(t = t\).
Therefore, instead of the classical reflexivity of identity, we get
the restricted version (remember that free quantification is
restricted):</p>

<p>

\[\forall x (x=x) \tag{RRef}\]
</p>

<p>
All the atomic formulas (even self-identities) are restricted to
\(E!\). Therefore, the following principle, that truth implies
\({E!}\) (TIE), is characteristic of negative free logic:</p>

<p>

\[P[t] \to {E!} t \tag{TIE}\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that this will not hold for positive free logic when \(P[t]\)
is \(t=t\).</p>

<p>
Since all the relational rules once again follow the geometric rule
schema, modularity is once again in effect and their additions do not
alter the structural properties of the base system.</p>

<p>
Positive free logic is the most widely used of the free logics, at
least in part because it represents the least intervention into the
familiar quantified first-order logic. Compared to it, negative free
logic adds a rule while weakening another, meaning that neither is a
proper part of the other. As one consequence, not too surprising if
one observes the form of their respective rules, \({E!} t\) is
equivalent to self-identity, \(t=t\), making it also straightforwardly
expressible in an existence-free language.</p>

<h3 id="NtFL_SC">3.5 Neutral Free Logic</h3>

<p>
The proof-theoretic presentation of the system for neutral free logic
here, due to Pavlovi&#263;
and Gratzl (2023) starts off from the sequent calculus for weak
Kleene logics from (Fjellstad
2020). The system there is a five-sided calculus, with the
fifth side introduced to account for crispness of formulas (formulas
are <em>crisp</em> when they are either true or false), specifically
in order to deal with the falsity conditions of the universal
quantifier (in weak Kleene logics it requires all instances to be
crisp).</p>

<p>
However, in neutral free logic, quantification is limited to the
extension of the predicate \({E!}\), which is itself always crisp
(subsequently, \(P(t_1...t_n)\) is crisp iff \({E!} t_i\) for \(1\leq
i\leq n\)). As a result, if for some \(t_i\) such that \({E!} t_i\)
the instantiated formula \(A[t_i/x]\) is not crisp, then for any such
\(t_i\) it is not crisp. Therefore, it follows from \(A[t_i/x]\) being
false that it is crisp for every \(t_i\) s.t. \({E!} t_i\), and
therefore the additional crispness condition is not required.</p>

<p>
The basic building block of the system is a (dual-)sequent of the
form</p>

<p>

\[\Gamma\ |\ \Gamma' \Rightarrow \Delta\ |\ \Delta'\]
</p>

<p>
where \(\Gamma\), \(\Gamma'\), \(\Delta\) and \(\Delta'\) are again
multisets, which is notational variation of the generalized
propositional sequent calculi for weak and strong Kleene in (Indrzejczak
2021b) (see
also Bochman 1998;
Degauquier 2016), extended to quantification.</p>

<p>
The vertical bar &lsquo;\(|\)&rsquo; is a structural comma (i.e. a
structural conjunction between antecedents and a structural
disjunction between succedents).</p>

<p>
In an implication format, the reading of this sequent is &ldquo;if
everything in \(\Gamma\) is true and everything in \(\Gamma'\)
non-false, then either something in \(\Delta\) is non-false or
something in \(\Delta'\) is true&rdquo;, while in the
negative-conjunction reading it states &ldquo;it is not the case that
everything in \(\Gamma\) is true, everything in \(\Delta\) is false,
everything in \(\Gamma'\) is non-false and everything in \(\Delta'\)
is non-true&rdquo;.</p>

fresh in rules marked with \(*\).</p>

<p>
Rules L\({E!}\) and R\({E!}\) tell us, in parallel to the rule
\({E!}\) of negative free logic, that in true atoms all terms are
\({E!}\), but also that all <em>false</em> atoms likewise contain only
terms that are \({E!}\). So, all crisp atoms contain only denoting
terms. Conversely, rules L&rsquo;\({E!}\) and R&rsquo;\({E!}\) tell us
that atoms containing only denoting terms are crisp (true or false,
respectively). Finally, transfer rules L\(Tr_{E!}\) and R\(Tr_{E!}\)
tell us that \({E!}\) atoms themselves are always crisp.</p>

<p>
Next, we proceed with identifying the propositional base to attach
these rules to. Two obvious candidates identified in the literature
(Priest 2008) are
weak Kleene (Bochvar and
Bergmann 1981) and strong Kleene (Kleene
1938) logics, of which the former
tends to be more prevalent.</p>

<h4 id="weak-kleene-base">Weak Kleene base</h4>

<p>
In discussing approaches to neutral free logic(s), Lehmann
(1980, 1994, 2002) argues as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The underlying semantic rationale for neutral free semantics is
Frege&rsquo;s functional view of reference: predicates and
&lsquo;=&rsquo; name functions from individuals to truth-values. If
functions are operations, as Frege seems to have thought, then the
semantic rules governing subject-predicate and identity constructions
are [such that] where there is no input to an operation, there is no
output either. The truth-functional connectives name truth-functions,
so the same line of thought dictates the weak tables for them. (Lehmann
2002, 234)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Following this reasoning the first sequent calculus we observe, G3wnf,
will be obtained by adding to the free quantifier and relational rules
weak Kleene base. To make things more manageable, here we restrict
ourselves to the negation and implication fragment of it:</p>

<p>

that it is not the case that an atom is neither true nor false (or, if
an atom is non-false then it is true on the implicational reading),
effectively blocking the third value. However, a restricted version of
that possibility,</p>

<p>

\[\{{E!} t_{i}\}_{1\leq i\leq n},\Gamma\ |\ \Gamma',P(t_1 ... t_n)\Rightarrow \Delta\ |\ \Delta',P(t_1 ... t_n)\tag{\(is_4\)}\]

<h2><a name="4">4. Generic Anomalies</a></h2>

<p>
While problems noted above are specific to particular forms of free
logic, there are anomalies that infect all, or nearly all, forms. This
section considers three: (1) a cluster of problems related to the
application of primitive predicates to empty terms, (2) the failure of
substitutivity <em>salva veritate</em> of co-referential expressions,
and (3) the inability of free logic to express sufficient conditions
for existence.</p>

<h3><a name="probs">4.1 Problems with Primitive Predicates</a></h3>

<p>
In classical logic and in positive free logic any substitution
instance of a valid formula (or form of inference) is itself a valid
formula (or form of inference). But in negative or neutral free logic
this is not the case. A <em>substitution instance</em> is the result
of replacing primitive non-logical symbols by possibly more complex
ones of the same semantic type&mdash;\(n\)-place predicates
with open formulas in \(n\) variables, and individual constants with
singular terms&mdash;each occurrence of the same primitive
symbol being replaced by the same possibly complex symbol. The
replacement of an occurrence of a primitive \(n\)-place predicate
\(P\) in some formula \(B\) by an open formula \(A\) with free
variables \(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\) is performed as follows: where \(t_1
,\ldots ,t_n\) are the individual constants or variables immediately
following \(P\) in that occurrence, replace P\(t_1 \ldots t_n\) in
\(B\) by \(A(t_i /x_i)\)&mdash;the result of replacing \(x_i\)
by \(t_i\) in \(A\), for each \(i\), \(1\le i\le n\).</p>

<p>
Let \(P\), for example, be a primitive one-place predicate. Then if
the semantics is negative, \(Pt \rightarrow \rE!t\) is valid. But now
consider the substitution instance \({\sim}Pt \rightarrow \rE!t\), in
which the open formula \({\sim}Px\) is substituted for \(P\). This
substitution instance is false when \(t\) is empty. Hence valid
formulas may have invalid substitution instances. The same holds for
ordinary neutral semantics that make conditionals true whenever their
consequents are true.</p>

<p>
In a negative semantics, moreover, the truth value of an empty-termed
statement depends arbitrarily on our choice of primitive predicates.
Consider, for example, a negative free logic interpreted over a domain
of people that takes as primitive the one-place predicate
&lsquo;\(A\)&rsquo;, meaning &ldquo;is an adult,&rdquo; and defines
&ldquo;is a minor&rdquo; by this schema:</p> 
\[ Mt \eqdf {\sim}At. \]

<p>
For any non-denoting name \(t, At\) is false in this theory; hence
\(Mt\) is true. If we take &lsquo;is a minor&rsquo; as primitive
instead, the truth-values of \(At\) and \(Mt\) are reversed. But why
should truth-values depend on primitiveness in this way?</p>

<p>
Positive semantics avoid these anomalies. But, if bivalent, in
application they force us to assign truth values to empty-termed
formulas in some other way, often without sufficient reason. Consider,
for example, these three formulas, all of which contain the empty
singular term &lsquo;\(1/0\)&rsquo; (where &lsquo;\(/\)&rsquo; is the
division sign):</p> 
\[\begin{aligned}
1/0 &amp;= 1/0 \\
 1/0 &amp;\gt 1/0 \\
 1/0 &amp;\le 1/0 
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Assuming a bivalent positive semantics, which ones should we make true
and which false? Since the semantics is positive, &lsquo;\(1/0 =
1/0\)&rsquo; is automatically true. One might argue further that since
&lsquo;\(\le\)&rsquo; expresses a relationship weaker than
&lsquo;=&rsquo; and since &lsquo;\(1/0 = 1/0\)&rsquo; is true,
&lsquo;\(1/0 \le 1/0\)&rsquo; should be true as well. But that is
merely to mimic with empty terms an inference pattern that holds for
denoting terms. To what extent is such mimicry justified? Suppose we
do decide to make &lsquo;\(1/0 \le 1/0\)&rsquo; true; should we
therefore make &lsquo;\(1/0 \gt 1/0\)&rsquo; false? There are no
non-arbitrary criteria for answering such questions. To a large
extent, of course, the answers don&rsquo;t matter. There are no facts
here; any consistent convention will do. But that&rsquo;s just the
problem. Some convention is needed, and establishing one can be a lot
of bother for nothing.</p>

<h3><a name="subfail">4.2 Substitutivity Failures</a></h3>

<p>
Classical predicate logic has the desirable feature that co-extensive
open formulas may be substituted for one another in any formula
<em>salva veritate</em>&mdash;i.e., without changing that
formula&rsquo;s truth value. (Open formulas \(A\) and \(B\) in \(n\)
free variables \(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\) are <em>coextensive</em> if and
only if \(\forall x_1 \ldots \forall x_n (A \leftrightarrow B)\) is
true.) But, as Lambert noted in 1974, this principle fails for nearly
all free logics with identity. Consider, for example, the formula
\(t=t\), where \(t\) is empty, which is an instance of the open
formula \(x=x\). Now \(x=x\) is coextensive with both \((x=x \amp
\rE!x)\) and \((\rE!x \rightarrow x=x)\), since all three formulas are
satisfied by all members of \(\bD\). Hence if co-extensive open
formulas could be exchanged <em>salva veritate</em>, \((t=t \amp
\rE!t)\) and \((\rE!t \rightarrow t=t)\) would have the same truth
value as \(t=t\). But on nearly all free logics this is not the case.
Positive free logic and supervaluations make \(t=t\) true and \((t=t
\amp \rE!t)\) false; negative free logic makes \(t=t\) false and
\((\rE!t \rightarrow t=t)\) true; and any ordinary neutral free logic
whose conditionals are true whenever their antecedents are false makes
\(t=t\) truth-valueless and \((\rE!t \rightarrow t=t)\) true. Many
find this troubling because, since Frege, it has been widely held that
(1) extensions of complex linguistic expressions should be functions
of the extensions of their components (so that co-extensive components
should be exchangeable without affecting the extension of the whole)
and (2) the extension of a formula (or statement) is a truth
value.</p>

<p>
One possible response is to reject (2). Leeb (2006) develops for a
version of PFL a dual-domain semantics in which the extensions of
formulas are abstract states of affairs. In this semantics,
co-referential open sentences are exchangeable not <em>salve
veritate</em>, but (as he puts it) <em>salve extensione</em>; that is,
the exchange does not alter the state of affairs designated by the
statement in which it occurs. But Leeb&rsquo;s state-of-affairs
semantics is so complex that it may discourage application.</p>

<p>
Those who wish to retain (2) may be consoled by the following
observation: though substitutivity <em>salve veritate</em> of
co-extensive open formulas fails for nearly all free logics, a related
but weaker principle, the substitutivity <em>salve veritate</em> of
co-<em>comprehensive</em> open formulas, is valid for positive free
logics. Open formulas \(A\) and \(B\) in \(n\) free variables \(x_1
,\ldots ,x_n\) are <em>co-comprehensive</em> if every assignment of
denotations in the outer domain \(\bD_o\) to \(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\)
satisfies \(A\) if and only if it satisfies \(B\). Among the open
formulas mentioned in the previous paragraph, for example, \(x=x\) and
\((\rE!x \rightarrow x=x)\) are co-comprehensive in a dual-domain
positive free logic, being satisfied by all members of \(\bD_o\), but
\((x=x \amp \rE!x)\) is not co-comprehensive with them, since it is
satisfied only by the members of \(\bD\). Unlike co-extensiveness,
however, co-comprehensiveness is not expressible in the language of
PFL. But it becomes expressible with the introduction of quantifiers
over the outer domain&mdash;a strategy considered in
 <a href="#Meinong">Section 5.5</a>.</p>
 
<h3><a name="inexp">4.3 Inexpressibility of Existence Conditions</a></h3>

<p>
&lsquo;Whatever thinks exists,&rsquo; &lsquo;Any necessary being
exists&rsquo;, &lsquo;That which is immediately known exists&rsquo;:
such statements of sufficient conditions for existence are prominent
in metaphysical debates. But, somewhat surprisingly, they are not
expressible in free logic. Their apparent form is \(\forall x(A
\rightarrow \rE!x)\). But because the universal quantifier ranges just
over \(\bD\), which is also the extension of E!, this form is valid in
free logic&mdash;as it is in classical logic with \(\rE!x\)
expressed as \(\exists y\,y=x\). No statement of this
form&mdash;not even &lsquo;all impossible things
exist&rsquo;&mdash;can be false. Hence on free logic all such
statements are equally devoid of content. Argument evaluation suffers
as a result. Consider, for example, the obviously valid inference:</p>

<table class="avoid-break cell-rl cellpad-small-dense centered">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>I think.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>Whatever thinks exists.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\therefore\)</td>
  <td>I exist.</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Its natural formalization in free logic is \(Ti, \forall x(Tx
\rightarrow \rE!x) \vdash \rE!i\). But this form is invalid. To obtain
the conclusion, we must first deduce \(Ti \rightarrow \rE!i\) by
specification from the second premise and then use modus ponens with
the first. But since the logic is free, specification requires the
question-begging premise \(\rE!i\).</p>

<p>
Unsatisfactory entailments involving &ldquo;existence
hedges&rdquo;&mdash;predications that entail the existence of
their objects&mdash;have recently come up in discussions of
neutral free logic in particular. Daniel Yeakel (2016, p. 379) argues
that &ldquo;on any neutral free logic either some existence hedges
will entail some undesired existence claims, or they will not entail
some desired existence claims.&rdquo; But the example of the previous
paragraph works for negative and positive free logics as well. A
remedy is not to be found in free logic alone, but again
quantification over the outer domain of a dual-domain semantics may
help (see
 <a href="#Meinong">Section 5.5</a>).</p>
 
<h2><a name="Applications">5. Some Applications</a></h2>

<p>
This section considers applications of free logic in theories of
definite descriptions, languages that allow partial or non-strict
functions, logics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics
that are in a certain sense &ldquo;Meinongian.&rdquo; Free logic has
also found application elsewhere&mdash;most prominently in
theories of predication, programming languages, set theory, logics of
presupposition (with neutral semantics), and definedness logics. For
more on these and other applications, see Lambert 1991 and 2001b;
Lehman 2002, pp. 250&ndash;253; and Nolt 2006, pp.
1039&ndash;1053.</p>

<h3><a name="defdes">5.1 Definite Descriptions</a></h3> One of the driving forces for the development of free
logic has been the investigation of the existence assumptions of
singular terms, more specifically <em>definite descriptions</em>.
Theories of definite descriptions are still both a play and a proving
ground within the conceptual framework of free logic. For a more
philosophical approach to definite descriptions, see the entry on 
 <a href="../descriptions/">descriptions</a>].


<h4 id="russellian-approach">Russellian approach</h4>

<p>
The most influential theory of definite descriptions of the first half
of the 20th century was developed by Bertrand Russell in his &ldquo;On
Denoting&rdquo; and was later incorporated (with more technical
apparatus) into the <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (Whitehead
and Russell
1910). Russell thought of definite descriptions as incomplete
symbols having only meaning in context and none in isolation; more on
this below. This also deprived the definite descriptions of the status
of singular terms.</p>

<p>
Whether or not this is the case, there are a couple of rather basic
thoughts and lessons that can be borne out: a definite description is
of the form: the \(A\), or the \(x\), such that \(A[x]\); where
&lsquo;the \(x\)&rsquo; is the description operator, and
&lsquo;\(A[x]\)&rsquo; is the basis of the description. A definite
description is (uniquely) satisfied just in case the basis of the
description is uniquely satisfied. Such a definite description is also
called <em>proper</em>. That is, the definite description &lsquo;the
current pope&rsquo; is uniquely satisfied since there is exactly one
object in the domain that satisfies &lsquo;being a pope&rsquo;, i.e.
the basis of the definite description. Note that the phrase &lsquo;the
base of a definite description being uniquely satisfied&rsquo; means
that there is exactly one object that satisfies it, or to be even more
painstakingly precise: there is at least one object that satisfies the
basis of the description and there is at most one.</p>

<p>
In order to incorporate definite descriptions into (some) formal
language some used an inverted iota, or an inverted capital I, we just
use \(\imath\), where \(\imath\) is a variable-binding term-forming
operator, such that: \(\imath x A\) is a singular term, if \(A\) is a
formula. This admittedly is not in the spirit of Russell, but very
much in the spirit of free logic that has its core the scientific goal
of unification. In this particular case this means that the plethora
of theories on definite descriptions can conveniently be both
developed and compared within the framework of free logic. However,
what is in the spirit of Russell is that definite descriptions
essentially occur in two contexts: (1) the \(A\) exists, and (2) the
\(A\) is \(F\). Russell&rsquo;s guiding principles, or as Russell puts
it, contextual definitions, are then stated as:</p>

<p>

\[E!\imath xA[x] \leftrightarrow \exists x(A[x] \wedge \forall y(A[y] \to x = y))\tag{R1}\]
</p>

<p>

\[F(\imath xA[x]) \leftrightarrow \exists x(A[x] \wedge \forall y(A[y] \to x = y) \wedge F[x])\tag{R2}\]
</p>

<p>
In accordance with what Russell tells us about definite descriptions
with a uniquely satisfied basis, the following formulas are
theorems:</p>

<p>

\[E!\imath xA[x] \to A[\imath x A[x]]\tag{T1}\]
</p>

<p>

\[E!\imath xA[x] \to \imath xA[x] = \imath xA[x]\tag{T2}\]
</p>

<p>
However, Russell&rsquo;s approach becomes less elegant if it comes to
the negative side, that is, if the basis of a definite description is
not uniquely satisfied. We just mention two here. First, following
(R2) negation of the left-hand side is ambiguous given the right-hand
side of the equivalence, it can either mean:</p>

<p>

\[\neg(\exists x(A[x] \wedge \forall y(A[y] \to x = y) \wedge F[x]))\]
</p>

<p>
or</p>

<p>

\[\exists x(A[x] \wedge \forall y(A[y] \to x = y) \wedge \neg F[x])\]
</p>

<p>
In order to disambiguate Russell invented <em>scope operators</em> to
distinguish the two different readings, in which he did not succeed
consistently; more work on the formal aspects of Russell&rsquo;s
theory are found e.g. (Scales
1969; Czermak 1974;
Donald Kalish 1992; Lambert 1997; Gratzl 2015). The second
inelegance is that, given that Russell denies definite descriptions
the status of singular terms, he needs a philosophical theory about
the logical structure of sentences and terms, which is interesting in
itself, but also cumbersome and furthermore leads to the fact that
Russell&rsquo;s approach is not closed under substitution, which is
not advantageous given that uniformity is a goal.</p>

<h4 id="hilbert-and-bernays-approach">Hilbert and Bernays Approach</h4>

<p>
Another way that would remain in classical logic but treats definite
descriptions radically different is found in Hilbert &amp; Bernays in
their <em>Grundlagen der Mathematik</em>, Vol. 1, 1934. In their
approach expressions of the form \(\imath xA\) are accepted as
singular terms just in case it is provable in the formal system, or
simply logic, that the basis of \(\imath xA\), i.e. \(A\), is uniquely
satisfied. That is, both formulas are provable:</p>

<p>

\[\exists xA[x], \ and \ \forall x \forall y(A[x] \wedge A[y] \to x = y)\]
</p>

<p>
If these formulas are provable, then \(A[\imath xA[x]]\) is among the
provable statements of the formal system in question. Now, this
approach has been critiqued on occasion for e.g. mingling the
formation rules of formulas and terms with provability of the formal
system, for not being natural &mdash; not even for mathematics for which it
has been originally developed for. The former point of critique can be
lifted, see e.g. (Lambert
1999); others were not so
impressed by the syntactic quagmire left behind by Hilbert and Bernays
and developed quite elaborated results, e.g. (Sch&uuml;tte
1971).</p>

<p>
On the positive side, there are two points: (1) it does not prove
\((***)\) (see below) and it proves \(t = \imath x(x = t)\). The last
formula is also known as <em>Frege&rsquo;s Law</em>, (FL), which Frege
introduced in his <em>Grundgesetze</em>; that is to say, in a
different context but (FL) is what we have nowadays in classical
first-order logic. Clearly, classical logic or even a free logic and
(FL) alone will not result in an interesting account of definite
descriptions.</p>

<h4 id="free-description-theories">Free Description Theories</h4>

<p>
Taking stock, there are options within classical logic to develop
quite divergent theories on definite descriptions, all of which have
their own merits and drawbacks. The three theories outlined have
background theories, or philosophical attitudes, of their own and so,
as the argument goes, are not directly comparable within one common
framework. Fortunately, here free logic offers a way out.</p>

<p>
Lambert&rsquo;s Law is the minimal principle (at least up to now) all
description theories based on free logic seem to agree upon:</p>

<p>

\[\forall x(x = \imath yA[y] \leftrightarrow \forall y(A[y] \leftrightarrow x = y))\tag{LL}\]
</p>

<p>
Following Lambert
(1997), it is also instructive to determine which effect (LL)
has if it is combined with classical logic; where it is assumed that
classical logic is closed under substitution for all singular terms.
From (LL) and axiom 3 (or as is also known: universal instantiation)
and tautologies, it follows that (this closely follows Lambert
1997):</p>

<p>

\[t = \imath xA \to A[t/x]\tag{*}\]
</p>

<p>
The following is a theorem:</p>

<p>

\[\imath x(P(x) \wedge \neg P(x)) = \imath x(P(x) \wedge \neg P(x)\tag{**}\]
</p>

<p>
But now contradiction follows from \((*), (**)\), and modus
ponens:</p>

<p>

\[P(\imath x(P(x) \wedge \neg P(x))) \wedge \neg P(\imath x(P(x) \wedge \neg P(x)))\tag{***}\]
</p>

<p>
Now, further inductive support for the usefulness of free logic is
that free logicians drew the morals of adopting a version of free
logic in which contradiction can be avoided; suffice it to say that in
the face of antinomy and it appropriate error analysis, typically some
routes are open for investigation, one that varies universal
instantiation is at least a viable and systematic option.</p>

<p>
We already introduced Hintikka&rsquo;s Law (HL), i.e.</p>

<p>

\[E!t \leftrightarrow \exists x(x = t)\tag{HL}\]
</p>

<p>
earlier. So, adding (HL) to PFL, Russell&rsquo;s (R1), (R2), (T1), and
(T2) are obtainable.</p>

<p>
However, NFL is more in tune with Russell&rsquo;s account (since
definite descriptions are, in fact, treated as genuine singular
terms), for this end NFL is accompanied with (LL) and a version of
axiom 8 of NFL including definite descriptions, i.e.:</p>

<p>

\[\iota xA[x] = \iota xA[x] \to E!\iota xA[x]\]
</p>

<p>
NFL enjoys the theorem of <em>indiscernability of non-existents</em>,
which has the following instance (given that NFL enriched with
definite descriptions is closed under substitution):</p>

<p>

\[\neg E!\imath xA \wedge \neg E!\imath xB \to (B[\imath xA] \to B[\imath xB])\]
</p>

<p>
Free description theories leaning more towards the positive side of
free logic are, for instance, theories building on (LL) and</p>

<p>

\[\forall x(A[x] \leftrightarrow B[x]) \to \imath xA[x] = \imath xB[x]\tag{Coext}\]
</p>

<p>
In (Morscher and Simons
2001b) the truth of this principle is called self-evident. The
predicates &lsquo;having kidneys&rsquo; and &lsquo;having a
heart&rsquo; are co-extensional, which is an empirical truth, and
according to (Coext) then implies that the \(x\) having a lung = the
\(x\) having a heart &mdash; a truth of the status of being obvious might be
challenged. Whereas, still having positive intuitions the predicates
&lsquo;being a Labrador full up with food&rsquo; and &lsquo;being a
Martian&rsquo; are co-extensional, both being empty, the then part:
the \(x\) being a Labrador full up with food = the \(x\) being a
Martian seems to be more in line with PFL. It is
noteworthy for Hilbert and Bernays (Coext) is a theorem given that the
uniquenss-conditions are provable for both \(A\), and \(B\).</p>

<p>
A principle related to (Coext) and still maintaining PFL is:</p>

<p>

\[\neg E!s \wedge \neg E!t \to s = t\tag{Negexid}\]
</p>

<p>
Both (Coext) and (Negexid) are reflections of the <em>chosen
object</em>-idea which assigns empty singular terms and arbitrary
object. Under this assumption one is back to the classical existence
assumptions, and so classical logic. The chosen-object theory is due
to Frege, the formulation used is due to Carnap (Carnap
1964): 
\[\forall x(x = \imath yA[y] \leftrightarrow\]

\[(\exists z(\forall y(A[y] \leftrightarrow y = z) \wedge z = x)\]
 
\[\vee \neg \exists z(\forall y(A[y] \leftrightarrow y = z) \wedge z=*))\tag{Chosob}\]
</p>

<p>
Technical investigations on the chosen object theory are found in
(Donald Kalish 1992)
and more recently and more proof-theoretically motivated in (Indrzejczak
2019). After a period of lull, where logical research on
definite descriptions was not so pronounced, the research into
definite descriptions has lately again picked up e.g. (K&uuml;rbis
2021, 2022).</p>

<h3><a name="Partial">5.2 Logics with Partial or Non-Strict Functions</a></h3>

<p>
Some logics employ primitive <em>n-place function
symbols</em>&mdash;symbols that combine with \(n\) singular
terms to form a complex singular term. Thus, for example, the plus
sign &lsquo;+&rsquo; is a two-place function symbol that, when placed
between, say, &lsquo;2&rsquo; and &lsquo;3&rsquo;, forms a complex
singular term, &lsquo;\(2 + 3\)&rsquo; that denotes the number five.
Similarly, &lsquo;\(^2\)&rsquo; is a one-place function symbol that,
when placed after a term denoting a number, forms a complex singular
term that denotes that number&rsquo;s square. Semantically, the
extension of a function symbol is a function whose arguments are
members of the quantificational domain \(\bD\), and the resulting
complex term denotes the result of applying that function to the
referents of the \(n\) component singular terms, taken in the order
listed. Since classical logic requires every singular term (including
those formed by function symbols) to refer to an object in \(\bD\),
for each such function symbol \(f\), it requires that:</p>

\[ \forall x_1 \ldots \forall x_n\exists y(y = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)). \]

<p>
Hence classical logic prohibits primitive function symbols whose
extensions are partial functions&mdash;functions whose value
is for some arguments undefined. Such, for example, is the binary
division sign &lsquo;/&rsquo;, since when placed between two numerals
the second of which is &lsquo;0&rsquo;, it forms an empty singular
term. Similarly, the limit function symbol &lsquo;lim&rsquo; yields an
empty singular term when applied to the name of a non-coverging
sequence. Classical logic can accommodate function symbols for partial
functions via elaborate contextual definitions. But then (as with
Russellian definite descriptions) the form in which these function
symbols are usually written is not their logical form. Free logic
provides a more elegant solution. Because it allows empty singular
terms, symbols for partial functions may simply be taken as
primitive.</p>

<p>
In applications of free logic involving partial functions, the
existence predicate &lsquo;\(\rE!\)&rsquo; is often replaced by the
postfix definedness predicate &lsquo;\(\downarrow\)&rsquo;. For any
singular term \(t, t\downarrow\) is true if and only if \(t\) has some
definite value in \(\bD\). Thus, for example, the formula
&lsquo;\((1/0)\downarrow\)&rsquo; is false. While some writers (e.g.,
Feferman (1995)) distinguish &lsquo;\(\downarrow\)&rsquo; from
&lsquo;\(\rE!\)&rsquo;, the literature as a whole does not, and
&lsquo;\(\downarrow\)&rsquo; is often merely a syntactic variant of
&lsquo;\(\rE!\)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
In addition to partial functions, <em>positive</em> free logics can
also readily handle <em>non-strict</em> functions. A non-strict
function is a function that may yield a value even if not all of its
arguments are defined. The binary function \(f\) such that \(f(x,y) =
x\), for instance, can yield a value even if the \(y\)-term is empty.
So, for example, the formula \(f(1, 1/0) = 1\) can be regarded as
true. Logics for non-strict functions must be positive because in a
negative or neutral logic empty-termed atomic formulas, such as \(f(1,
1/0) = 1\), cannot be true. Free logics involving non-strict functions
find application in some programming languages (Gumb 2001, Gumb and
Lambert 1991). Such logics may employ a dual-domain semantics in which
the referents of empty functional expressions such as
&lsquo;1/0&rsquo; are regarded as <em>error
objects</em>&mdash;objects that correspond in the running of a
program to error messages. Thus, for example, an instruction to
calculate \(f(1, 1/0)\) might return the value 1, but an instruction
to calculate \(f(1/0, 1)\) would return an error message.</p>

<h3><a name="Kripke">5.3 Logics with Kripke Semantics</a></h3>

<p>
Kripke semantics for quantified
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logics</a>,
 <a href="../logic-temporal/">tense logics</a>,
 <a href="../logic-deontic/">deontic logics</a>,
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/">intuitionistic logics</a>, and so on, are often free. This is because they index
truth to certain objects that we shall call &ldquo;worlds,&rdquo; and
usually some things that we have names for do not exist in some of
these worlds. Worlds may be conceived in various ways: they may, for
example, be understood as possible universes in alethic modal logic,
times or moments in tense logic, permissible conditions in deontic
logic, or epistemically possible states of knowledge in intuitionistic
logic. Associated with each world \(w\) is a domain \(\bD_w\), of
objects (intuitively, the set of objects that exist at \(w)\). An
object may exist in (or &ldquo;at&rdquo;) more than one world but need
not exist in all. Thus, for example, Kripke semantics for tense logic
represents the fact that Bertrand Russell existed at one time but
exists no longer by Russell&rsquo;s being a member of the domains of
certain &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;&mdash;that is, times
(specifically, portions of the last two centuries)&mdash;but
not others (the present, for example, or all future times). Two
natural assumptions are made here: that the same object may exist in
more than one world (this is the assumption of <em>transworld
identity</em>), and that some singular terms&mdash;proper
names, in particular&mdash;refer not only to an object at a
given world, but to that same object at every world. Such terms are
called <em>rigid</em> <em>designators</em>. Any logic that combines
rigid designators with quantifiers over the domains of worlds in which
their referents do not exist must be free.</p>

<p>
Kripke semantics gives predicates different extensions in different
worlds. Thus, for example, the extension of the predicate &lsquo;is a
philosopher&rsquo; was empty in all worlds (times) before the dawn of
civilization and more recently has varied. For rigidly designating
terms, this raises the question of how to evaluate atomic formulas at
worlds in which their referents do not exist. Is the predicate
&lsquo;is a philosopher&rsquo; satisfied, for example, by Russell in
worlds (times) in which he does not exist&mdash;times such as
the present? The general answers given to such questions determine
whether a Kripke semantics is positive, negative or neutral.</p>

<p>
For negative or neutral semantics, the extension at \(w\) of an
\(n\)-place predicate \(P\) is a subset of \(\bD_w^n\). An atomic
formula can be true at \(w\) only if all its singular terms have
referents in \(\bD_w\); if not, it is false (in negative semantics) or
truth-valueless (in neutral semantics). In a positive semantics,
atomic formulas that are empty-termed at \(w\) may nevertheless be
true at \(w\). Predicates are usually interpreted over the union
\(\bU\) of domains of all the worlds, which functions as a kind of
outer domain for each world, so that the extension of an \(n\)-place
predicate \(P\) at a world \(w\) is a subset of \(\bU^n\). Some
applications, however, require predicates to be true
of&mdash;and singular terms to be capable of
denoting&mdash;objects that exist in no world. If so, we may
collect these objects into an outer domain that is a superset of
\(\bU\). (They might be fictional objects, timeless Platonic objects,
impossible objects, or the like.)</p>

<p>
Quantified formulas, like all formulas, are true or false only
relative to a world. Thus \(\exists xA\), for example, is true at a
world \(w\) if and only if some object in \(\bD_w\) satisfies \(A\).
Except in intuitionistic logic, where it has a specialized
interpretation, the universal quantifier is interpreted similarly:
\(\forall xA\) is true at \(w\) if and only if all objects in
\(\bD_w\) satisfy \(A\). Kripke semantics often specify that for each
\(w, \bD_w\) is nonempty, so that the resulting free logic is
non-inclusive&mdash;but we shall not do so.</p>

<p>
Any of various free modal or tense logics can be formalized by adding
to a language \(\bL\) of the sort defined in
 <a href="#language-of-free-logic">Section 1.3</a>
 the sentential operator &lsquo;\(\Box\)&rsquo;. If \(A\) is a
formula, so is \(\Box A\). In alethic modal logic, this operator is
read &ldquo;it is necessarily the case that.&rdquo; More generally, it
means &ldquo;it is true in all accessible worlds that,&rdquo; where
accessibility from a given world is a different relation for
different modalities: possibility for alethic logics, permissibility
for deontic logics, various temporal relations for tense logics, and
so on. A typical bivalent Kripke model \(\bM\) for such a language
consists of a set of worlds, a binary accessibility relation \(\bR\)
defined on that set; an assignment to each world \(w\) of a domain
\(\bD_w\); an &ldquo;outer&rdquo; domain \(\bD_o\) of objects (which
typically is either \(\bU\) or a superset thereof); and a two-place
interpretation function \(\bI\) that assigns denotations at worlds to
individual constants and extensions at worlds to predicates. For each
individual constant \(t\) and world \(w, \bI(t,w)\in \bD_o\). In such
a model, a singular term is a rigid designator if and only if for all
worlds \(w_1\) and \(w_2\), \(\bI(t,w_1) = \bI(t,w_2)\). For every
\(n\)-place predicate \(P, \bI(P,w) \subseteq \bD_w^n\) if the
semantics is negative or neutral; if it is positive, \(\bI(P,w)
\subseteq \bD_o^n\). Truth values at the worlds of a model \(\bM\) are
assigned by a two-place valuation function \(\bV\) (where \(\bV(A,w)\)
is read &ldquo;the truth value \(\bV\) assigns to formula \(A\) at
world \(w\)&rdquo;) as follows:</p> 
\[\begin{aligned}
\bV(Pt_1 \ldots t_n,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff } \langle\bI(t_1,w),\ldots,\bI(t_n,w)\rangle \in \bI(P,w); \\
 \bot, \text{ otherwise.} 
\end{array}\right. \\
 \bV(s=t,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff } \bI(s,w)=\bI(t,w); \\
 \bot, \text{ otherwise.} 
\end{array}\right. \\
 \bV(\rE!t,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff } \bI(t,w) \in \bD_w; \\

 \bV({\sim}A,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff } \bV(A,w) = \bot\\
 \bot, \text{ otherwise.} 
\end{array}\right. \\
 \bV(A\rightarrow B,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff } \bV(A,w) = \bot \text{ or } \bV(B,w) = \top; \\
 \bot, \text{ otherwise.} 
\end{array}\right. \\
 \bV(\Box A,w) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\top, \text{ iff for all } u \text{ such that } w\bR u, \bV(A,u) = \top\\

 \quad(\text{where } t \text{ is not in } A \text{ and } \bV_{(t,d)} \text{ is the}\\
 \quad\text{valuation function on the model just like } \bM \\
 \quad\text{except that its interpretation function } \bI^* \text{ is} \\
 \quad\text{such that for each world } w, \bI^*(t,w)= d); \\
 \bot, \text{ otherwise.} 
\end{array}\right. 
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Under the stipulations that admissible models make all individual
constants rigid designators and that \(\bI(P,w) \subseteq \bD_o^n\),
the standard free logic PFL, together with the modal axioms and rules
appropriate to whatever structure we assign to \(\bR\), is sound and
complete on this semantics.</p>

<p>
Modal semantics thus defined call for free logic whenever worlds are
allowed to have differing domains&mdash;that is whenever we
may have worlds \(u\) and \(w\) such that \(\bD_u \ne \bD_w\). For in
that case there must be an object \(d\) that exists in one of these
domains (let it be \(\bD_w)\), but not the other, so that any singular
term \(t\) that rigidly designates \(d\) must be empty at world \(u\).
Hence \({\sim}\exists x(x=t)\) (which is self-contradictory in
classical logic) must be true at world \(u\). Such a semantics also
requires free logic when \(\bD_o\) contains objects not in \(\bU\),
for in that case rigid designators of these objects are empty in all
worlds. Finally, this semantics calls for <em>inclusive</em> logic if
any world has an empty domain. Thus, given this semantics, the only
way to make the resulting logic unfree is to require that domains be
<em>fixed</em>&mdash;i.e., that all worlds have the same
domain \(\bD\), that \(\bD\) be non-empty, and that \(\bD_o =
\bD\).</p>

<p>
Just this trio of requirements was in effect proposed by Saul Kripke
in his ground-breaking (1963) paper on modal logic as one of two
strategies for retaining classical quantification. (The other, more
draconian, strategy was to allow differing domains but ban individual
constants and treat open formulas as if they were universally
quantified.) But such fixed-domain semantics validate the implausible
formula:</p> 
\[ \forall x\Box \exists y(y = x), \]

<p>
which asserts that everything exists necessarily and the equally
implausible Barcan formula:</p> 
\[ \forall x\Box A \rightarrow \Box \forall xA \]

<p>
(named for Ruth Barcan, later Ruth Barcan Marcus, who discussed it as
early as the late 1940s). To see its implausibility, consider this
instance: &lsquo;If everything is necessarily a product of the big
bang, then necessarily everything is a product of the big bang&rsquo;.
It may well be true that everything (in the actual world) is
necessarily a product of the big bang&mdash;i.e., that nothing
in this world would have existed without it. But it does not seem
necessary that everything is a product of the big bang, for other
universes are possible in which things that do not exist in the actual
world have other ultimate origins. Because of the restrictiveness and
implausibility of fixed-domain semantics, many modal logicians loosen
Kripke&rsquo;s strictures and adopt free logics.</p>

<p>
We may also drop the assumption that singular terms are rigid
designators and thus allow <em>nonrigid designators</em>. On the
semantics considered here, these are singular terms \(t\) such that
for some worlds \(w_1\) and \(w_2, \bI(t,w_1) \ne \bI(t,w_2)\).
Definite descriptions, understood attributively, are the best
examples. Thus the description &ldquo;the oldest person&rdquo;
designates different people at different times
(worlds)&mdash;and no one at times before people existed
(&ldquo;worlds&rdquo; \(w\) at which \(\bI(t,w)\) is undefined).</p>

<p>
Nonrigid designators, if empty at some worlds, require free logics
even with fixed domains. (Thus classical logic with nonrigid
designators is possible only if we require for each singular term
\(t\) that at each world \(w\), \(t\) denotes some object in
\(\bD_w\).) On some semantics for nonrigid designators, the quantifier
rule must differ from that given above, and other adjustments must be
made. For details, see Garson 1991, Cocchiarella 1991, Schweitzer 2001
and Simons 2001.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/">Intuitionistic logic</a>,
 too, has a Kripke semantics, though special valuation clauses are
needed for &lsquo;\({\sim}\)&rsquo;, &lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(\forall\)&rsquo; in order to accommodate the special meanings
these operators have for intuitionists, and &lsquo;\(\Box\)&rsquo; is
generally not used. The usual first-order intuitionistic logic, the
Heyting predicate calculus (HPC)&mdash;also called the
intuitionistic predicate calculus&mdash;has the theorem
\(\exists x(x=t)\) and hence is not free. But intuitionists admit the
existence only of objects that can in some sense be constructed, while
classical mathematicians posit a wider range of objects. Therefore
users of HPC cannot legitimately name all the objects that classical
mathematicians can. Worse, they cannot legitimately name objects whose
constructibility has yet to be determined. Yet some Kripke-style
semantics for HPC do allow use of names for such objects
(semantically, names of objects that &ldquo;exist&rdquo; at worlds
accessible from the actual world but not at the actual world itself).
Some such semantics, though intended for HPC, have turned out,
unexpectedly, not to be adequate for HPC. An obvious fix, advocated by
Posy (1982), is to adopt a free intuitionistic logic. For more on this
issue, see Nolt 2007.</p>

<h3><a name="fiction">5.4 Logics of Fiction</a></h3>

<p>
Because fictions use names that do not refer to literally existing
things, free logic has sometimes been employed in their analysis. So
long as we engage in the pretense of a story, however, there is no
special need for it. It is true, for example, in Tolkien&rsquo;s
<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> that Gollum hates the sun, from which
we can legitimately infer that <em>in the story</em> there exists
something that hates the sun. Thus quantifiers may behave classically
so long as we consider only what occurs and what exists &ldquo;in the
story.&rdquo; (The general logic of fiction, however, is often
regarded as <em>non</em>classical, for two reasons: (1) a story may be
inconsistent and hence require a
 <a href="../logic-paraconsistent/">paraconsistent logic</a>,
 and (2) the objects a story describes are typically (maybe always)
incomplete; that is, the story does not determine for each such object
\(o\) and every property \(P\) whether or not \(o\) has \(P\).)</p>

<p>
The picture changes, however, when we distinguish what is true in the
story from what is literally true. For this purpose logics of fiction
often deploy a sentence operator that may be read &ldquo;in the
story.&rdquo; Here we shall use &lsquo;\(\mathbf{S}_x\)&rsquo; to mean
&ldquo;in the story \(x\),&rdquo; where &lsquo;\(x\)&rsquo; is to be
replaced by the name of a specific story. Anything within the scope of
this operator is asserted to be true in the named story; what is
outside its scope is to be understood literally. (For a summary of
theories of what it means to be true in a story, see Woods 2006.)</p>

<p>
With this operator the statement &lsquo;In the story, <em>The Lord of
the Rings</em>, Gollum hates the sun&rsquo; may be formalized as
follows:</p> 
\[\tag{GHS} \mathbf{S}_{The\: Lord\: of\: the\: Rings}(\text{Gollum hates the sun}). \]

<p>
The statement that in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> something hates
the sun is:</p> 
\[ \mathbf{S}_{The\: Lord\: of\: the\: Rings}\exists x(x \text{ hates the sun}). \]

<p>
This second statement follows from the first, even though Gollum does
not literally exist. But it does not follow that there exists
something such that it, in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, hates the
sun:</p> 
\[ \exists x \mathbf{S}_{The\: Lord\: of\: the\: Rings}(x \text{ hates the sun}). \]

<p>
and indeed that statement is not true, for, literally, Gollum does not
exist. Since the sun, however, exists both literally and in the story,
the statement:</p> 
\[ \exists x\mathbf{S}_{The\: Lord\: of\: the\: Rings}(\text{Gollum hates } x) \]

<p>
is true and follows by free existential generalization from (GHS)
together with the true premise &lsquo;\(\rE!(\text{the sun})\)&rsquo;.
Thus free logic may play a role in reasoning that mixes fictional and
literal discourse.</p>

<p>
Terms for fictional entities also occur in statements that are
entirely literal, making no mention of what is true &ldquo;in the
story.&rdquo; Consider, for example, the statement:</p> 
\[\tag{G} \text{Gollum is more famous than G&ouml;del.} \]

<p>
Mark Sainsbury (2005, ch. 6) holds that reference failure invariably
makes such statements false and hence that they are best represented
in a negative free logic. Others, however&mdash;including
Orlando 2008 and Dumitru and Kroon 2008&mdash;question
Sainsbury&rsquo;s treatment, maintaining that statements like (G) are
both atomic and true. If so, they require a positive free logic. The
logic must be free because it deals with an empty singular term, and
it must be positive, because only on a positive semantics can
empty-termed atomic statements be true. One must still decide,
however, whether the name &lsquo;Gollum&rsquo; is to be understood as
having no referent or as having a referent that does not exist.</p>

<p>
If &lsquo;Gollum&rsquo; has no referent, then (G) might be handled by
a <em>single-domain</em> positive semantics. But that semantics would
have to treat atomic formulas non-standardly; it could not, as usual,
stipulate that (G) is true just in case the pair \(\langle\)Gollum,
G&ouml;del\(\rangle\) is a member of the extension of the predicate
&lsquo;is more famous than&rsquo;; for if there is no Gollum, there is
no such pair. On such a semantics &lsquo;Gollum is more famous than
G&ouml;del&rsquo; would not imply that something is more famous than
G&ouml;del.</p>

<p>
If, on the other hand, terms such as &lsquo;Gollum&rsquo; refer to
non-existent objects, then those objects could inhabit the outer
domain of a dual-domain positive free logic. Dumitru (2015), for
example, lays out such a dual-domain semantics for fictional discourse
using free descriptions and compares it with a supervaluational
approach that also uses free descriptions. In a such a dual-domain
semantics, atomic formulas have their standard truth conditions: (G)
is true just in case \(\langle\)Gollum, G&ouml;del\(\rangle\) is a
member of the extension of &lsquo;is more famous than&rsquo;.
Moreover, if we allow quantifiers over that outer domain, then
&lsquo;Something is more famous than G&ouml;del&rsquo; (where the
quantifier ranges over the outer domain) does follow from
&lsquo;Gollum is more famous than G&ouml;del&rsquo;, though
&lsquo;There <em>literally exists</em> something more famous than
G&ouml;del&rsquo; (where the quantifier ranges over the inner domain)
does not. Meinongian logics of fiction employ this strategy.</p>

<h3><a name="Meinong">5.5 Meinongian Logics</a></h3>

<p>
Alexius Meinong is best known for his view that some objects that do
not exist nevertheless have being. His name has been associated with
various developments in logic. Some free logicians use it to describe
any dual-domain semantics. For others, Meinongian logic is something
much more elaborate: a rich theory of all the sorts of objects we can
think about&mdash;possible or impossible, abstract or
concrete, literal or fictional, complete or incomplete. In this
section the term is used to describe logics stronger than the first
type but possibly weaker than the second: positive free logics with an
extra set of quantifiers that range over the outer domain of a
dual-domain semantics.</p>

<p>
Whether such logics can legitimately be considered free is
controversial. On older conceptions, free logic forbids any
quantification over non-existing things (see Pa&#347;niczek 2001 and
Lambert&rsquo;s reply in Morscher and Hieke 2001, pp.
246&ndash;8). But by anybody&rsquo;s definition, Meinongian
logics in the sense intended here at least <em>contain</em> free
logics when the inner domain is interpreted as the set of existing
things. Moreover, on the strictly semantic definition, which is also
that of Lehman 2002, whether the members of \(\bD\) exist is
irrelevant to the question of whether a logic is free. For a defense
of this definition, see Nolt 2006, pp. 1054&ndash;1057.</p>

<p>
Historically, quantification over domains containing objects that do
not exist has been widely dismissed as ontologically irresponsible.
Quine (1948) famously maintained that existence is just what an
existential quantifier expresses. Yet nothing forces us to interpret
&ldquo;existential&rdquo; quantification over every domain as
expressing existence&mdash;or being of any sort. Semantically,
an existential quantifier on a variable \(x\) is just a logical
operator that takes open formulas on \(x\) into truth values; the
value is T if and only if the open formula is satisfied by at least
one object in the quantifier&rsquo;s domain. That the objects in the
domain have or lack any particular ontological status is a
philosophical interpretation of the formal semantics. Alex Orenstein
(1990) argues that &ldquo;existential&rdquo; is a misnomer and that we
should in general call such quantifiers &ldquo;particular.&rdquo; That
suggestion is followed in the remainder of this section.</p>

<p>
Quantifiers ranging over the outer domain of a dual-domain semantics
are called <em>outer quantifiers</em>, and those ranging over the
inner domain <em>inner quantifiers</em>. If the inner particular
quantifier is interpreted to mean &ldquo;there exists&rdquo; and the
members of the outer domain are possibilia, then the outer particular
quantifier may mean something like &ldquo;there is possible a thing
such that&rdquo; or &ldquo;for at least one possible thing.&rdquo; We
shall use the generalized product symbol &lsquo;\(\Pi\)&rsquo; for the
outer universal quantifier and the generalized sum symbol
&lsquo;\(\Sigma\)&rsquo; for its particular dual. This notation
enables us to formalize, for example, the notoriously puzzling but
obviously true statement &lsquo;Some things don&rsquo;t exist&rsquo;
(Routley 1966) as:</p> 
\[ \Sigma x{\sim}\rE!x. \]

<p>
Since in a dual-domain semantics all singular terms denote members of
the outer domain, the logic of outer quantifiers is not free but
classical. With &lsquo;E!&rsquo; as primitive, the free inner
quantifiers can be defined in terms of the classical outer ones as
follows:</p> 
\[\begin{aligned}
\forall xA &amp;\eqdf \Pi x(\rE!x \rightarrow A) \\
 \exists xA &amp;\eqdf \Sigma x(\rE!x \amp A). 
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
The outer quantifiers, however, cannot be defined in terms of the
inner.</p>

<p>
Logics with both inner and outer quantifiers have various
applications. They enable us, for example, to formalize substantive
sufficient conditions for existence and hence adequately express the
argument of
 <a href="#inexp">Section 4.3</a>,
 as follows:</p> 
\[ Ti, \Pi x(Tx \rightarrow \rE!x) \vdash \rE!i. \]

<p>
This form is valid. The co-comprehensiveness of open formulas \(A\)
and \(B\) in \(n\) free variables \(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\) (see
 <a href="#subfail">Section 4.2</a>),
 can likewise be formalized as:</p> 
\[ \Pi x_1 \ldots \Pi x_n (A \leftrightarrow B). \]

<p>
Richard Grandy&rsquo;s (1972) theory of definite descriptions holds
that \(\iota xA=\iota xB\) is true if and only if \(A\) and \(B\) are
co-comprehensive and thus is readily expressible in a Meinongian
logic. Free logics with outer quantifiers have also been employed in
logics that are Meinongian in the richer sense of providing a theory
of objects (including, in some cases, fictional objects) that is
inspired by Meinong&rsquo;s work (Routley 1966 and 1980, Parsons 1980,
Jacquette 1996, Pa&#347;niczek 2001, Priest 2005 and 2008, pp.
295&ndash;7).</p>
