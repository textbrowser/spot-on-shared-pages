<h1>Philosophy of Cell Biology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 15, 2019; substantive revision Tue Jan 6, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Among biological entities, cells are regarded as of special importance
since they are widely viewed as the simplest organized systems that
are unambiguously alive. Although one can debate about entities such
as viruses, there is little debate that cells are living. Cells
perform all the activities critical to life, from metabolism to
reproduction. All cells alive today maintain themselves far from
thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment and are the product
of a continuous lineage of cell division that goes back approximately
4 billion years. The study of cells has required developing means of
materially manipulating them and our contemporary understanding of
cellular phenomena integrates results from a wide range of material
interventions. In introducing a special issue of <em>Studies in
History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences</em> on
the cell, O&rsquo;Malley and M&uuml;ller-Wille assert</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The cell, we suggest, is a nexus: a connection point between
disciplines, methods, technologies, concepts, structures and
processes. Its importance to life, and to the life sciences and
beyond, is because of this remarkable position as a nexus, and because
of the cell&rsquo;s apparently inexhaustible potential to be found in
such connective relationships. (2010: 169)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The examination of cell biology, in turn, is a potent nexus for
productive interactions between philosophers, historians, social
scientists, as well as cell biologists, each of whom raises questions
about the study of cells relevant to the others.</p>

<p>
During the period when philosophy of science focused primarily on
laws, cell biology was largely neglected. Although it is important to
cell biologists to discover useful generalizations, these are seldom
characterized as laws. Once philosophers of science turned their
attention from laws to mechanisms, from representational realism to
models and their functionality, and from concepts and theories to
experiments and instrumentation, more philosophers of science have
turned their attention to the practices of cell biology. These
practices are epistemically challenging. Due to the fact that cells
are mostly microscopic, their study raises traditional philosophical
issues concerning the status of unobservables and the trustworthiness
of evidence. Since a major concern of cell biology is to relate
functions (e.g., biochemical reactions) to cell structures, cell
biologists need not just to observe but also to physically manipulate
cells and their constituent structures and to develop informative
representations. Their activities thus provide rich examples for
philosophers. Although a great deal of cell biology has yet to be
tapped for philosophical analysis, we provide examples in which
philosophers (as well as historians) have investigated and analyzed
material practices in cell biology. We start, however, closer to
theoretical interests, examining how the discipline of cell biology
developed and how metaphors have played crucial roles in shaping how
scientists have conceptualized cells. Subsequently we turn to
controversies over whether cells can be understood mechanistically or
require a vitalist or holist perspective. After that, we turn to
questions of epistemology, including strategies for representing cells
visually and for developing mechanistic accounts of cell
functioning.</p>

<h2 id="WhaCelBio">1. What is Cell Biology?</h2>

<p>
It is sometimes assumed that scientific disciplines are sharply
delineated and can be defined by their subject matter. In fact,
however, they are dynamically changing, shaped in large part by
scientists, their research tools, and academic and research
institutions. This is clearly true in the case of cell biology.
Scientists began investigating cells in the seventeenth century after
Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek reported what they saw with newly invented
microscopes. Hooke (1665) gave cells their name. But the cell did not
become a focal unit for studying biological processes until Schleiden
(1838) and Schwann (1839) advanced the cell theory according to which
cells are the basic living units. The term <em>cytology</em> was
widely used for the studies that ensued, which focused mainly on
describing cells as seen under the light microscope. Although Wilson
used the phrase <em>cellular biology</em> in his introduction to
Cowdry&rsquo;s <em>General Cytology</em> (Cowdry 1924), and many of
its contributors aspired to integrate disciplines studying cells, the
term <em>cell biology</em> was only introduced in the years
immediately after World War II. Those adopting the term <em>cell
biology</em> advocated complementing new higher-resolution images
created with the electron microscope with results from biochemical,
biophysical, and molecular approaches to cells. This transition is
exemplified in the naming of what would become the flagship journal in
the field. The working title used in discussions about founding a new
journal was <em>Journal of Cytology</em>. At the time of the first
issue in 1955, it was called the <em>Journal of Biophysical and
Biochemical Cytology</em>, a title chosen to emphasize the integration
of multiple approaches to the study of cells. In 1962 it was
re-christened <em>The Journal of Cell Biology</em>, by which time the
International Society for Cell Biology and the American Society for
Cell Biology had also been established and the term <em>cell
biology</em> had acquired general currency for an integrated approach
to cells. (Bechtel 2006: chapter 7, examines the establishment and
renaming of the journal as well as the creation of the American
Society for Cell Biology.)</p>

<p>
The introduction of new research techniques, especially cell
fractionation and electron microscopy, figured centrally in the
efforts to establish cell biology as a distinct discipline in the
post-World War II period as they enabled constructing what Palade
(1987) termed a bridge between morphological observations and
biochemistry. Cell fractionation employs the ultracentrifuge to
separate cell contents into fractions that contain the enzymes
responsible for distinct cell activities while electron microscopy
enables these fractions to be linked to organelles identifiable in
cells. Bechtel (2006) and Matlin (2018) describe how Claude employed
centrifugation to identify microsomes which exhibited high
concentrations of RNA. Porter&rsquo;s (1953) complementary micrographs
of these particles in fractions and tissue slices (Figure 1) linked
microsomes to the intracellular structure he had named the
<em>endoplasmic reticulum</em>. As Matlin describes, this cycling
between cell fractionation to establish function and electron
microscopy to localize it to a structure was pursued repeatedly in
cell biology.</p>

(1953), plate 48.</p>
</div>

<p>
In terms of content, however, the break between cytology and cell
biology was nowhere near as sharp as the founders of cell biology
portrayed. Cowdry&rsquo;s <em>General Cytology</em> (1924) clearly had
similar aspirations of linking studies of morphology and studies of
cellular chemistry (see discussions by historians, philosophers, and
biologists of Cowdry&rsquo;s project in Matlin, Maienschein, &amp;
Laubichler 2018). But in terms of the institutions in which scientists
conducted their research, the break was quite significant. With the
creation of professional societies using the name <em>cell
biology</em>, biologists began to self-identify as cell biologists.
Laboratories and academic departments adopted the name <em>cell
biology</em> and funding agencies recognized cell biology as a
supported field of research.</p>

<p>
Although cell biologists actively courted biochemists and to some
degree biophysicists to join their new discipline, these efforts
largely failed. The most enduring connections were with molecular
biology, which was established as a new discipline in the same period
(see the entry on
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>).
 While molecular biology began with a focus on bacterial phage
(viruses that infect bacteria) and cell biology with eukaryotic cells
from mammals and plants, by the 1970s each discipline had broadened
its focus and soon many cell biologists were adopting a molecular
approach to cell structure and function. (A continuing point of
difference between cell biology and molecular biology is that cell
biology placed high value on linking chemical and molecular processes
to cell structure; see Matlin 2016; 2022). Academic departments began
to include both <em>cell</em> and <em>molecular</em> in their names.
In November 1989 the American Society for Cell Biology created a new
journal, <em>Cell Regulation</em>, but with its third volume in
January 1992, the name was changed to <em>Molecular Biology of the
Cell</em>. Although there are textbooks that reference just <em>cell
biology</em> in their title, several of the most prominent textbooks
feature both <em>cell</em> and <em>molecular</em>. These include
Alberts&rsquo; <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em> (Alberts,
Johnson, Lewis et al. 2015), Cooper and Hausman&rsquo;s <em>The Cell:
A Molecular Approach</em> (2007), and Iwasa and Marshall&rsquo;s
<em>Karp&rsquo;s Cell and Molecular Biology</em> (2016). The first
edition of Alberts&rsquo; <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>
(Alberts, Bray, Lewis et al. 1983) was modeled in part on
Watson&rsquo;s <em>Molecular Biology of the Gene</em> (1976) and
included Watson as a co-editor. Alberts attributes the vision of
integrating cell and molecular biology to Watson (see interview with
Alberts in the Oral History Collection at Cold Springs Harbor
Laboratory linked in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources below</a>)</p>
 
<h2 id="OntIssIWhaCel">2. Ontological Issues I: What is a Cell?</h2>

<p>
Not only have the disciplines studying cells undergone historical
transformations, so has the understanding of what cells are. As Hesse
(1966) argued, in many fields the objects of study are characterized
through metaphors to more familiar objects. In examining the different
metaphors that have been invoked for cells, Reynolds argues that the
choice of metaphor has consequences for how cells are understood:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Metaphorical language &hellip; has been essential not only to the
activity of <em>describing</em> cells but also to <em>seeing</em> and
<em>understanding</em> them, and has played no less a fundamental role
than the literal and material lenses of the microscope. (2018: 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Reynolds distinguishes two fundamental classes of metaphors: <em>cells
as human artifacts</em> and <em>cells as organisms.</em> Each has
taken on a variety of more specific forms. Among artifacts, cells have
been characterized as spaces enclosed by solid walls, building blocks,
factories, various types of machines, and electronic computers. The
organismal metaphors have suggested a conceptualization of cells as
elementary organisms (like unicellular amoebae) or citizens in a state
or society in which there is a division of labor and in which cells
make decisions that determine their own developmental
&lsquo;fates&rsquo;, including the ultimate decision to initiate
programmed cell death (Reynolds 2014; see also Reynolds 2022). These
metaphors have given rise to distinctive research agendas that focus
on specific aspects of cells and their relationship to other cells and
their environment. Although it cannot be given proper due here, the
relations of cells to their environment, especially other cells, is
often critical to their functioning. Bacterial cells have long been
viewed as solitary, in part because they are generally studied in
culture, but in fact most live in complex biofilms and engage in
complex communication both between individuals in a species and those
in different species (Liu, Martinez-Corral, Prindle et al. 2017).</p>

<p>
When Hooke introduced the term <em>cell</em> in <em>Micrographia</em>
in 1665 to describe the microscopic structure of cork that he observed
using a compound microscope
 (<a href="#fig2a">Figure 2A</a>),
 he was comparing cells to the polygonal cells of beeswax and the
small rooms occupied by monks in a monastery. (Hooke 1665: 116, also
commented on the fluid content of cells, labeling them
&ldquo;<em>succus nutritus</em>, or appropriate juices of
vegetables&rdquo;. As discussed below, the fluid content of cells took
on new importance with the advent of the protoplasm theories in the
mid-nineteenth century.) Although researchers who focused on plants
tended to find Hooke&rsquo;s metaphor appropriate, since plant cells
have clearly observable walls, others, beginning with van Leeuwenhoek,
who examined spermatozoa
 (<a href="#fig2b">Figure 2B</a>),
 animal tissues, and bacteria, tended to adopt other terms such as
<em>corpuscle</em> or <em>globule</em>.</p>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2:</span> Hooke&rsquo;s drawing clearly

</div>

<p>
Most of these early investigators focused on describing what they saw
in the microscope. But some, such as Buffon (1749), began to view
cells as basic living units. Nicholson characterizes this as the
beginning of an atomist tradition in biology that identified</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a basic indivisible unit of life and [sought] to explain the
morphological constitution and physiological operation of all living
beings in terms of these fundamental units. (2010: 203)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This more theoretically committed conception of cells is exemplified
in the publications of Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839), who are
generally credited with establishing the cell theory, the fundamental
tenet of which is that cells are the basic units of living things.</p>

<p>
Focusing exclusively on plants, Schleiden asserted that
&ldquo;&hellip; every plant &hellip; is an aggregate of fully
individualized, independent, separate beings, the cells
themselves&rdquo; (1838 [1847: 231&ndash;2]). In addition to their
walls, Schleiden appealed to the nucleus, which had been identified
with improved microscopes by Brown (1833), to identify plant cells.
The nucleus figured centrally in Schleiden&rsquo;s account of cell
formation according to which a new cell formed through a process like
crystal formation&mdash;one type of material is deposited around the
nucleolus to form the nucleus and then other material was deposited to
form the cell body. The metaphor comparing cell formation to crystal
formation played a yet larger role when Schwann confronted the
challenge that animal cells differ vastly in their appearance. Schwann
argued that they were nonetheless all cells since they all formed
through a process analogous to crystal formation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an
analogous, though very diversified manner, so that it may be asserted
<em>that there is one universal principle of development for the
elementary parts of organisms, however different, and that this
principle is the formation of cells.</em> (Schwann 1839 [1847:
165])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(For discussion of this and other uses of the crystal metaphor in
biology, see Haraway 1976.)</p>

<p>
Given that Schwann and Schleiden were masters of microscopy (as
witnessed by their drawings based on their microscopic observations),
and that other equally competent microscopists reported cells
dividing, their claim that cells form like crystals seems anomalous.
Bechtel (1984) argues that Schwann&rsquo;s strong commitment to
developing mechanistic accounts of vital processes may have played a
major role in how he interpreted what he saw&mdash;the crystal
formation metaphor provided a mechanistic model whereas at the time
there were no mechanical models for cell division. In any case,
Schleiden&rsquo;s and Schwann&rsquo;s accounts of cell formation were
soon set aside as more researchers reported on cell division and
Schwann&rsquo;s concerns with mechanism were supplanted by other
concerns. Virchow (1855), a pathologist, offered a theoretic argument
that only a process like cell division could explain the transmission
of disease and coined the oft-cited dictum &ldquo;<em>omnis cellula e
cellula</em>&rdquo; (all cells come from cells).</p>

<p>
Schwann&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory of the cell&rdquo;, however, was much
richer than his soon rejected view of cell formation. He argued that
cells were the basic units in which the processes of life (he coined
the term <em>metabolism</em>) occurred. He viewed metabolic processes
as catalyzed by the specific materials that were deposited in cells as
they formed. Schwann (1836) had himself recently discovered pepsin, a
catalyst that breaks down egg albumin. (Pepsin operates, however, not
within cells but after being secreted into intercellular spaces.) When
a year later he argued that fermentation could not occur without the
involvement of a whole living yeast cell (Schwann 1837), some critics
took Schwann to be claiming that living systems exhibited mysterious
vital properties. But for Schwann this was consistent with his
mechanist approach&mdash;the metabolic processes only occurred when
the responsible catalysts were brought together in cells.</p>

<p>
In the mid- to late-nineteenth century theorizing about cells went in
a number of directions. One direction focused even more than Schwann
on the material stuff constituting the cell. In the same period as
Schwann was advancing his theory of the cell, von Mohl (1835), a plant
researcher, introduced the name <em>protoplasm</em> for the fluid
material in cells. Animal researchers such as Dujardin (1835) called
the fluid seen in animal cells <em>sarcode</em>. Remak (1852) proposed
the protoplasm theory according to which the basic material of plants
and animal was identical and T. H. Huxley (1869) took this a step
further, arguing that protoplasm was the &ldquo;physical basis of
life&rdquo;. As discussed by Reynolds, protoplasm theory offered a
different fundamental biological theory&mdash;whereas Schleiden and
Schwann</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
sought to unify all the various forms of life through a common
morphological type and developmental principle, the protoplasm theory
attempted to achieve this through the identification of a common
substance or material. (2018: 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Accordingly, some supporters of protoplasm sought to dislodge the cell
as a basic living unit. The botanist Julius Sachs (1892), for example,
asserted &ldquo;to call the protoplasm unit a cell was about as
appropriate as calling a live bee in a honeycomb a cell&rdquo; (as
translated by Welch &amp; Clegg 2010: C1281). Since protoplasm appears
as a viscous substance that is only artificially constrained by cell
boundaries, some protoplasm theorists viewed it as supplanting the
cell as an organizing unit. Where Schwann understood the cell to be
the fundamental unit of biological development, protoplasm theorists
understood protoplasm to drive ontogeny and cells to be merely
secondary structures deposited in the course of this primary
substance&rsquo;s development. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century a number
of researchers focused on how protoplasm streams in both plants and
slime molds (see Dietrich 2015 for a detailed discussion of this
research). Recently a few biologists (Welch &amp; Clegg 2010, 2012)
and philosophers (Nicholson, 2010) have argued for reviving protoplasm
theory. Their argument is that protoplasm theory presents a more
holistic systems or organismal perspective. (We discuss holism and
organicism in
 <a href="#OntIssIIMecVsVitHolOrg">Section 3</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The characterization of protoplasm as just a viscous substance
existing on its own was complicated by the identification of the cell
membrane as a structure distinct from the cell wall and, as discussed
below, of membrane-bound organelles. In the end, most biologists
acquiesced in some version of Schultze&rsquo;s (1861: 11; as
translated by Hall, 1951: 451) compromise position that raised
protoplasm to be one defining feature of cells when he defined a cell
as &ldquo;a lump of protoplasm inside of which lies a nucleus&rdquo;.
Those who adopted such a compromise position often invoked a metaphor,
originating with Raspail, according to which the cell is &ldquo;a kind
of laboratory within which all tissues organize and grow&rdquo; (1843:
28; as translated by Harris, 1999: 32). The laboratory metaphor
encouraged attempts to develop chemical explanations for all the
reactions occurring in cells. There were a number of variants on this
theme. Unger analogized the plant cell with a &ldquo;m&auml;chtige
chemische Werkst&auml;tte&rdquo; (powerful chemical workshop) (1851:
23) and Virchow stated that &ldquo;starch is transformed into sugar in
the plant and animal just as it is in a factory&rdquo; (1858:
107).</p>

<p>
Embracing this chemical perspective, several chemists sought to
identify the chemical catalysts needed for the reactions to occur.
Fermentation was a common focus and K&uuml;hne (1877) coined the term
<em>enzyme</em> (Greek for &ldquo;in yeast&rdquo;) for the putative
catalyst operative in yeast. Enthusiasm for this effort was
temporarily dampened by Pasteur (1860). A noted chemist, he
nonetheless maintained that fermentation could only be carried out in
whole living cells. This reflects a conception of the cell as an
explanatorily irreducible unit of life&mdash;a conception associated
with vitalism (discussed in more detail below). Enthusiasm for the
factory conception, though, was rekindled by Buchner (1897). Guided by
Pasteur&rsquo;s contention that fermentation could not occur in the
absence of cells, he added sugar to an extract he prepared by
destroying all whole cells, thinking it would serve as a preservative.
When he observed the emission of bubbles, indicating fermentation in
the absence of living cells, he changed course and galvanized the
pursuit of chemical investigations of metabolism that resulted in the
establishment of modern biochemistry in the first decades of the
twentieth century (Kohler 1971; Cornish-Bowden 1997). One of its early
successes was the characterization in the 1930s of a pathway of enzyme
catalyzed reactions responsible for fermentation.</p>

<p>
At first the factory metaphor simply identified the cell as the place
in which chemical reactions occur, but over time researchers began to
focus on the different machines within the factory. This focus on
separate machines in the factory was promoted in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century when, using improved microscopes and
applying stains to enhance contrast, investigators began to identify
structures within cells and theorize about their functional
significance. Researchers were particularly successful in
characterizing the nuclear events in cell division and fertilization.
Flemming (1879, 1882) described in detail how the threads that he
called <em>chromatin</em> (due to their absorption of dye), later
named <em>chromosomes</em>, divided longitudinally, with the two
halves moving apart so that one of each would end up in each daughter
cell
 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).
 Soon after researchers such as Weismann and Correns pointed to links
between chromosome transmission and heredity, but it was Boveri (1902)
and Sutton (1903) who provided the compelling evidence that
Mendel&rsquo;s factors (what would soon be called <em>genes</em>) are
in or on chromosomes. Darden and Maull (1977) analyze the linking of
genes to chromosomes as a major example of what they termed
<em>interfield theories</em>, theories that do not try to reduce one
account to another but integrate the findings of different fields in a
theory that bridges them.</p>

 </div>

<p>
Late in the nineteenth century cytologists also succeeded in
identifying membrane-enclosed structures in the cytoplasm that came to
be known as <em>organelles</em>. Altmann (1890), using new stains he
developed, observed filaments within cells that he took to be
elementary organisms (a view he explicitly set in opposition to the
protoplasm theory). Although many researchers challenged
Altmann&rsquo;s observations, Benda (1899) confirmed the existence of
filaments using a different stain and gave them the name
<em>mitochondria</em> (Greek for &ldquo;thread&rdquo; and
&ldquo;granule&rdquo;). Because of their reactivity with oxidative
stains, Michaelis (1899) proposed that they figured in oxidative
reactions in cells. Yet other researchers identified other organelles
such as the Golgi apparatus (Golgi 1898) and ergastoplasm (Garnier
1897), which was ultimately identified as the endoplasmic
reticulum.</p>

<p>
In the early decades in the twentieth century biochemists and
cytologists developed their own research techniques and pursued their
investigations independently of the other. Most biochemists implicitly
embraced the assumption that the cell was a bag of chemicals that
could be studied in the extracts remaining after cell structure was
destroyed whereas those pursuing cytological inquiries tended to
embrace the factory metaphor in which organelles were distinct
machines. As witnessed by Cowdry&rsquo;s (1924) <em>General
Cytology</em> and Bourne&rsquo;s (1942) <em>Cytology and Cell
Physiology</em>, there were researchers who desired to build bridges
between biochemistry and cytology. There were some techniques, albeit
limited, for determining the chemical composition of organelles
(essentially, those of cytochemistry and histochemistry, which relied
on determining to which chemicals various stains bound). The nearly
simultaneous introduction of cell fractionation and electron
microscopy in the late 1940s provided the needed research techniques
and, as noted in
 <a href="#WhaCelBio">Section 1</a>,
 helped establish modern cell biology. In addition to the linkage of
microsomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, described above, researchers
linked oxidative metabolism to the inner membrane of the
mitochondrion. New structures were also discovered and connected to
functions, such as the lysosome which was linked to the breakdown and
recycling of disrupted cell components (de Duve 1958).</p>

<p>
The process of advancing new conceptions of cells continues. We note
just one example here. The pioneers of cell biology in the 1940s and
1950s embraced the "machines in a factory" metaphor, treating cell
organelles as compartments in which different chemical reactions were
catalyzed by the enzymes housed there. Once formed, the compartments,
on this view, did not change&mdash;the crucial activities occurred
within them. Over time, however, some researchers within cell biology
began to identify cell structures that executed mechanical movements,
as anticipated by Flemming&rsquo;s (1882) characterization of the cell
spindle as pulling chromosomes apart in mitosis. Of particular
importance was research on the cytoskeleton (now understood to consist
of actin fibres, intermediate filaments, and microtubules). The term
<em>cytoskeleton</em>was invoked in the 1930s and 1940s to denote a
rigid structure, and indeed it does help give cells their shape,
albeit not a rigid one. It was soon found to be the locus of movement.
H. E. Huxley (1969) advanced an account of muscle contraction as
resulting from myosin molecules forming bridges that pull on actin
filaments. Both actin filaments and microtubules were found to
continually extend themselves at one end by incorporating new proteins
while removing them from the other, a process characterized as
<em>treadmilling</em> (Cleveland 1982). Video observations of
organelles moving along microtubules (R. Allen et al. 1982) led to the
discovery of kinesins (Vale, Reese, &amp; Sheetz 1985), molecular
motors that <em>walk</em> along microtubules carrying cargo. (For more
detailed historical discussion of the discovery of kinesin, see
Mattlin 2020 and Bechtel &amp; Bollhagen 2021). It also focused new
attention on dyneins (Paschal &amp; Vallee 1987), previously only
known for their roles in cilia and flagella, as carrying cargo in the
opposite direction. Recognition of this continual movement of material
within cells gave rise to a new metaphor of the cell as a city with
bustling traffic (Vale &amp; Milligan 2000).</p>

<h2 id="OntIssIIMecVsVitHolOrg">3. Ontological Issues II: Mechanists Vs. Vitalists and Holists (Organicists)</h2>

<p>
Most of those pursuing the various metaphors discussed in the previous
section embraced a view that had its origins in Descartes, who
maintained both non-living and living systems (with the exception of
the human mind) operated like machines. But a significant number of
researchers rejected this perspective and maintained that living
organisms, including cells, are fundamentally different from ordinary
physical, mechanical systems. They argued that in one way or another
composition from material components is insufficient to account for
the phenomena associated with cells. We begin with these opponents of
mechanistic conceptions of cells and then examine how those advocating
mechanistic approaches responded.</p>

<p>
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century the opponents of mechanism
were typically referred to as <em>vitalists</em>. The various
vitalists all rejected mechanism, taken as the view that organisms are
composed of physical parts that operate in accord with the same
principles as processes in the non-living world. Their positive views
varied. Some vitalists adopted a position much like that of substance
dualists with respect to the mind, arguing that some non-material
component&mdash;a vital force (<em>vis vitalis</em>)&mdash;operates in
living beings and accounts for their distinctive activities. Others
avoided positing an extra component but maintained that different laws
apply in living organisms than in non-living systems (for discussions
of these different versions of vitalism, see Wolfe 2023 and
contributions in Normandin &amp; Wolfe 2013 and Donohue and Wolfe
2023). Regardless of how they expressed their positive views,
vitalists commonly pointed to activities of living organisms that they
claimed could not be accounted for in the same manner as physical
processes. This is well illustrated in Bichat (1805), who focused
first on the apparent lack of determinism in the behavior of
biological organisms and second on the fact that organisms seemed to
oppose physical processes that threatened to destroy them (in his
words, they <em>resist death</em>). As noted above, Schwann and
Pasteur both claimed that living yeast are needed to produce
fermentation. While for Schwann this only entailed that fermentation
depended on the specific combination of materials found in cells, for
vitalists it entailed that living cells perform activities that could
not be performed by the collection of component molecules. Bichat and
Pasteur, as well as other prominent vitalists such as M&uuml;ller
(1837&ndash;1840), embraced empirical and experimental research, but
drew limits with respect to what could be explained by appeal to the
material components of an organism alone.</p>

<p>
In many cases, mechanists did not explicitly respond to vitalists but
simply moved forward with their research. Bernard (1865) was an
exception. He addressed Bichat&rsquo;s challenges by introducing a
distinction between an organism&rsquo;s internal and external
environment. Mechanistic operations within organisms are carried out
in the internal environment and jointly serve to maintain that
environment in a constant state. Because mechanistic operations
respond to conditions in the internal environment, they appear
indeterminate when considered only in relation to external stimuli.
Moreover, because these mechanisms work to maintain a constant
internal environment, one could explain the ability of organisms to
resist physical processes that might otherwise destroy them (for
discussions of Bernard see Holmes 1974 and LaFollette &amp; Shanks
1994). Bernard&rsquo;s approach was the foundation for Cannon&rsquo;s
later well-known work on homeostasis (1929). (For a more detailed
account of Bernard and Cannon&rsquo;s contribution to homeostasis and
the central role that concept plays in accounts of how mechanisms in
cells are regulated, see Bechtel and Bich 2025.)</p>

<p>
By the beginning of the twentieth century few biologists investigating
cells (Driesch, 1914, being a notable exception) espoused vital forces
and vitalism <em>per se</em> ceased to be regarded as a tenable
position. But many biologists were still concerned to account for
differences between living cells and ordinary material systems. A
prominent position adopted by many investigators (Haldane 1929, 1931;
Lillie 1934; Needham 1936; Russell 1945, 1930; Von Bertalanffy 1952;
Weiss 1963; Woodger 1929) was <em>holism</em>, sometimes referred to
as <em>organicism</em>. (See Nicholson and Gawne 2015, Peterson 2016,
and contributions to Wolfe 2024 for analyses of how the organicists
differentiated their position from both vitalism and mechanism.)
Holists accepted that living systems were built out of material parts.
They insisted, however, that the activities performed by components of
living systems depended not just on those components and their
composition but on their organization. Accordingly, one cannot just
add together the activities of the components to account for the whole
(&ldquo;the whole is not just the sum of its parts&rdquo;). The
organized whole in part determines how the parts behave. This attitude
is manifest, for example, in J. S. Haldane&rsquo;s opposition to
investigating the origins of life from non-living matter: &ldquo;There
is and can be no origin of life out of mechanical conditions. Such an
origin is inconceivable&rdquo; (Haldane 1930: 12).</p>

<p>
The organization of cellular systems plays a central role in the
dialectic between mechanistic biologists and holists. Holists often
construe mechanistic biologists as downplaying the importance of
organization, but many mechanistic biologists deny this. Bernard had
emphasized the role of organization in allowing components to maintain
the constancy of the internal environment and those seeking to explain
homeostasis appealed to feedback loops. Recognizing that mechanistic
accounts are not limited to a simple, additive view of organization,
J. S. Haldane&rsquo;s son, J. B. S. Haldane, abandoned his
father&rsquo;s commitment to holism and embraced a mechanistic
framework that emphasized how biological components are affected by
being incorporated within organized systems. In making this break with
his father he was heavily influenced by working with the biochemist
Hopkins (1913), who likewise made organization central to his accounts
of biochemical processes. Accordingly, J. B. S. Haldane became one of
the pioneers in formulating biological inquiry into the origins of
life while still insisting that complex organization figured centrally
in activities of living organisms (Martin 2010). While contemporary
cell biologists only rarely invoke the term &ldquo;organicism,&rdquo;
sufficient interest in the concept persists among philosophers of
biology that in 2025 Matlin and Reynolds convened a seminar entitled
&ldquo;Is Organicism a Useful Concept: A Critical Historical and
Philosophical Analysis&rdquo; at the Marine Biological Laboratory at
Woods Hole, MA.</p>

<p>
Philosophers and scientists often invoke the word <em>emergent</em>
for phenomena that are different from the phenomena generated by their
components (see the entry on
 <a href="../properties-emergent/">emergent properties</a>).
 Sometimes emergent phenomena are viewed as incapable of being
explained in terms of their constituents. In the context of
characterizing systems biological accounts of cell phenomena, Boogerd
et al. (2005) develop an account according to which emergent phenomena
are ones that are fully explicable in terms of how their constituents
behave in the organized system, but not in terms of how they behave in
simpler (less complexly organized) systems. This recognizes that many
cellular constituents behave differently when incorporated into
particular systems in which they receive distinctive inputs. For other
recent treatments of emergence and its applications to cell biology,
see (Hooker 2011a; S. Mitchell 2012; Mossio, Bich, &amp; Moreno 2013;
Winning &amp; Bechtel 2019).</p>

<p>
The desire to understand how the organization in cells and
multicellular organisms differs from that found in most naturally
occurring systems or human-made artifacts motivated a body of research
in <em>theoretical biology</em> in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the most
prominent contributors to theoretical biology were Pattee (many of his
most important papers have been collected in Pattee 2012), Rosen
(1985, 1991), Polanyi (1968), and Waddington (1961). Philosophy of
biology, as it developed as a specialty in philosophy of science in
the 1970s and 1980s, largely ignored this tradition. Today, however, a
number of philosophers concerned with cell biology are drawing upon
its insights. Here we focus on one key conceptual tool theoretical
biologists provide for understanding the distinctive activities of
living systems such as cells: constraints. The notion of constraint is
drawn from classical mechanics, where constraints serve to constitute
macro-scale objects from their micro-scale particles. Constraints thus
account for why macro-scale objects exhibit different properties than
their constituents. Constraints are not explained by laws but rather
serve as boundary conditions that must be ascertained empirically.
Accordingly, to the degree constraints explain biological activities
of cells, these activities cannot be reduced, in the sense of being
derived from the principles of chemistry or physics. Instead,
researchers must, on the basis of empirical inquiry, identify the
constraints actually realized in living cells.</p>

<p>
The importance of constraints for understanding cellular and other
biological phenomena has been developed recently by Hooker (2011b,
2013) and Moreno and Mossio (2015). Hooker makes clear that, although
the term <em>constraint</em> suggests limitations, constraints also
extend possibilities&mdash;to offer a cellular example, microtubules
that run from the cell center to the periphery restrict the movement
of the kinesin and dynein motors that move on them but also provide a
possibility for transport of organelles to distant locations. Moreno
and Mossio in particular develop a perspective that links the focus on
constraints to the idea that living cells are autopoietic. Drawing
upon Maturana and Varela&rsquo;s (1980) conception of living systems
as autopoietic machines&mdash;machines that provide a network of
production that enables the construction of the living
system&mdash;Moreno and Mossio add a focus on the thermodynamic
requirements of cells. Cells, as highly organized systems, are far
from equilibrium and require a continual source of free energy to
carry out the operations required to synthesize new components and
resist the tendency towards equilibrium. What constraints do in
organisms, on their account, is direct flows of free energy to perform
the work of building, repairing, and reproducing the organism. (For a
related, but distinct, account of the role of constraints in
understanding biological systems, see Matlin and Green 2024.)</p>

<p>
Some constraints are flexible, and these make possible an important
feature of living systems&mdash;the ability of organisms to control
production mechanisms (such as those involved in fermentation or
muscle contraction) through the actions of control mechanisms. On
Pattee&rsquo;s account, control mechanisms change the flexible
constraints in <em>production mechanisms</em>in light of information
that is procured by making measurements. Negative feedback control
mechanisms, such as thermostats, are simple examples: the thermostat
makes a measurement of a variable (temperature in the room) that is
affected by the operation of the production mechanisms&mdash;the
furnace&mdash;and based on the measurement executes action on the
constraints in the furnace mechanism. Examples of feedback control
mechanisms are widespread in cells. Some of the best-known examples
are the <em>lac</em> operon (Jacob &amp; Monod 1961) and feedback
control of glycolysis by ATP (Ghosh &amp; Chance 1964). The
measurements used by control systems need not be restricted to states
affected by the activity of the production mechanism; they can also
measure states in the organism or states in its environment. Using
such measurements, production mechanisms can be controlled so as to
operate only in particular circumstances, enabling the organism, for
example, to navigate to a food source or avoid a predator as
needed.</p>

<p>
Moreno and Mossio (2015) offer an account in which appropriately
organized productive and control mechanisms enable cells, and by
extension multi-cellular organisms, to achieve what they refer to as
<em>biological autonomy</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a distinctive regime of causation, able not only of producing and
maintaining the parts that contribute to the functioning of the system
as an integrated, operational, and topologically distinct whole but
also able to promote the conditions of its own existence through its
interaction with the environment. (2015: xvi&ndash;xvii; see also Bich
2024)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that mechanisms, on this view, are contained within cells and
that it is cells, not mechanisms that are autonomous. What becomes
crucial for understanding the autonomy of cells is the organization of
control mechanisms that orchestrate the activities of various
productive mechanisms so as to maintain the cell (or the multicellular
organism). One notable feature of this focus on the organization
needed to maintain autonomy is that it is compatible with the more
traditional philosophical accounts of mechanism (discussed in
 <a href="#EpiIssIIStrForExpCelActMec">section 5</a>)
 but emphasizes a feature not prominent in them&mdash;that production
mechanisms are subject to control mechanisms. To understand the
behavior of cellular mechanisms, researchers must not only look inside
mechanisms to their organized parts and operations but outside to how
they are situated in cells and organisms in such a way that they can
be controlled by other mechanisms (Winning &amp; Bechtel 2018). Such
an ontological framework for understanding cells (as well as
multicellular organisms) integrates insights from traditional
mechanists in biology and their vitalist/organicist/holist critics,
capturing what is distinctive of living organisms within a framework
that accepts them as consisting of mechanisms, but mechanisms
organized in appropriate ways (Bich &amp; Bechtel (2022).</p>

<p>
As the discussion makes clear, the metaphor of mechanism has played a
major role in both biologists&rsquo; and philosophers&rsquo;
understanding of cells. Nicholson (2013, 2019) has argued against
those who have invoked the metaphor at the level of the cell, seeing
the cell as itself a machine. Many cell biologists invoke the metaphor
not for the whole cell but for its component, treating the cell as
consisting of machines (or more commonly mechanisms). Machine-like
entities and processes are invoked in explaining the activities of
cells. Bechtel &amp; Bollhagen (2021), for example, discuss the
explanations cell biologists give of molecular motor activity as
involving the conversion of chemical energy stored in ATP into
mechanical motion on analogy with how a combustion engine converts the
chemical energy in gasoline into motion. Nicholson (2019, 2020) has
also challenged this use of the machine metaphor, arging that these
entities operate at the nanoscale and so don&rsquo;t behave like
machines.</p>

<p>
While maintaining the framework of mechanism in explaining cell
processes, Levy and Bechtel (2020) have emphasized ways in which some
mechanisms invoked in cell biology are less machine-like than
traditionally assumed&mdash;mechanisms in which, for example, it is
bulk properties such as relative concentrations of components that
determine the activity or in which it is changes that the mechanism
components undergo that matter. In other cases, such as research on
the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, however, Bechtel, Bich,
&amp; Bollhagen (forthcoming) have shown that biologists have appealed
to mechanisms that behave very much like those in human made machines.
For recent defenses of the invocation of machines or mechanisms in
understanding cells, see Levy (2023), Barwich and Rodriguez (2024) and
Militello &amp; Moreno (2018).</p>

<h2 id="EpiIssIRepCelCelPro">4. Epistemic issues I: Representing cells and cellular processes</h2>

<p>
We turn now from questions about the ontological status of cells to
epistemic questions about how scientists study them. We begin with how
scientists represent cells and information about them. Traditionally,
philosophy of science has focused on linguistic representations of
scientific knowledge. But in many fields of biology and especially in
cell biology, information is often presented in images.
Scientists&rsquo; very familiarity with cells results from visual
representations generated using microscopes. Developing microscopes
and techniques for using them to produce interpretable images
presented a number of challenges. We begin in section 4.1 with the
challenges in generating images (micrographs) at all and in section
4.2 consider challenges in evaluating the reliability of the resulting
images. Beyond these replete (highly detailed) representations, cell
biologists rely on a variety of less replete diagrams. (The
characterization of images as &ldquo;replete&rdquo; is due to Perini,
2013. Drawing on Goodman, she uses relative repleteness to
differentiate diagrams from pictures.) In particular, as discussed in
 <a href="#DiaCelBio">section 4.3</a>,
 when they are developing mechanistic hypotheses about cells, cell
biologists rely on cell diagrams that represent types of cell
components and mechanism diagrams that represent select components
within cells that are hypothesized to constitute parts of the
mechanism responsible for a given phenomenon (Downes 1992).</p>

<h3 id="Mic">4.1 Micrographs</h3>

<p>
As discussed above, in the seventeenth century both Hooke and van
Leeuwenhoek pioneered the use of light microscopes to observe cells.
Subsequent investigators often designed their own microscopes. The
variations in these designs contributed to variability in the
resulting images. (Before photography, microscopists drew what they
saw using the microscope, introducing another source of variation.)
The variability of the images different researchers produced was one
factor that led biologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
to examine more carefully the processes through which microscopes
generate images (Schickore 2001, 2007). In his theoretical studies of
lenses, Newton (1704) characterized two types of aberrations created
by lenses: spherical aberrations, resulting from light rays coming
into focus at different points, and chromatic aberrations, resulting
from light of different wavelengths being refracted at different
angles. Schickore (2007) describes the many efforts by microscope
developers to correct for these aberrations and the creation of test
objects for evaluating the reliability of particular microscopes.
During the same time enthusiasts were advancing many claims about what
they saw, some of which were shown later to be artifacts. For example,
both Milne-Edwards (1823) and Dutrochet (1824) reported round
structures of a constant size similar to that reported for cells,
which they termed <em>globules</em>. (See Schickore 2009 for a
detailed examination of the reports of globules and an argument that
it was the variability in these reports that contributed to the
growing sense that something was amiss in the practices of the
microscopists.) Globules were, however, soon shown to be the products
of spherical aberrations. In the early nineteenth century several lens
makers developed strategies for eliminating spherical aberrations and
greatly limiting chromatic aberration (chromatic aberrations were not
fully eliminated until the introduction of the apochromatic lenses in
mid-century). As a result, the observations by Schleiden, Schwann, and
others discussed above were largely free of these distortions.</p>

<p>
Light microscopes faced another limit, that on magnification (a
limitation imposed by the wavelength of light). For cell researchers
to obtain higher-resolution images that could reveal constituents of
cells, a microscope relying on different physical principles was
required. The most important alternative to the light microscope for
studying cells was the (transmission) electron microscope, which
employs beams of electrons to create images in a manner comparable to
photography: locations on the photographic plate hit by many electrons
are black in the negative and white in the positive image. Although
electron microscopes were available in the early 1930s, only in the
years just before and during World War II did biologists begin to
explore their potential. One difficulty they confronted is that most
eukaryotic cells are too thick to be penetrated by the 50kV electron
beam available in the first electron microscopes. Microtomes had been
developed for cutting slices of cells for light microscopy, but new
approaches to microtome design were required to slice cells
sufficiently thinly without creating distortions. This problem was not
solved until the early 1950s (Porter &amp; Blum 1953). Accordingly,
some of the first electron micrograph studies focused on fibrous
material such as collagen (Schmitt, Hall, &amp; Jakus 1942) or on
bacteria (Stanley &amp; Anderson 1941). Porter, Claude, and Fullam
(1945) created the first electron micrograph of a eukaryotic cell by
culturing it under conditions where the periphery spread very thinly,
allowing electrons to penetrate. They generated an image
 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>)
 that showed at the periphery</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
filamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width;
scattered, small elements of high density especially abundant around
the nucleus and presumably representing Golgi bodies; and a delicate
lace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm. (1945: 246)</p>

<p>
Besides the challenge of creating preparations sufficiently thin to be
penetrated by the electron beam, researchers confronted a number of
other challenges in preparing biological material for electron
microscopy. For example, specimens must be placed in vacuum, and this
requires first removing all water, the primary constituent of cells,
without inducing too many distortions. Several historians and
philosophers (Rheinberger 1995, Rasmussen 1997, and Bechtel 2006) have
examined how biologists confronted these challenges and evaluated the
reliability of the resulting micrographs. How they addressed one
challenge&mdash;that of creating sufficient contrast in the
images&mdash;greatly affected the images that were produced. This was
already a challenge with light microscopy: cell material is mostly
translucent so that the light transmitted is mostly of the same
wavelength, making it hard to differentiate the various structures in
the image. To address the challenge, light microscopists in the
mid-nineteenth century began experimenting with dyes used for fabrics.
As noted in
 <a href="#OntIssIWhaCel">Section 2</a>,
 Flemming named the nuclear structures he observed chromatin since
they bound the aniline dye he was using. The problem for electron
microscopy was similar&mdash;cell components differ little in their
ability to block electron transmission. Electron microscopists found
that several of the fixatives used in light microscopy, especially
those involving heavy metals, enhanced the ability to block electrons,
and accordingly the contrast in the resulting images. Given that there
was little knowledge about what given chemicals would bind to within
the cell, the investigation of these stains was mostly pursued by
researchers trying out different compounds and procedures for applying
them (exemplified in Palade&rsquo;s 1952, study of osmium tetroxide)
to see what images they could generate. Indeed, different stains
(osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, etc.) did yield different
images.</p>

<p>
The latter half of the twentieth century saw important innovations in
light microscopy that depended upon the ability to make and analyze
film of cell movement. Microcinematography, as the technique was
initially called, allowed researchers to record cell movement over
many hours and to create time-lapse movies that made apparent
movements to slow to be discerned otherwise (Landecker 2011). In 1978,
at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, Robert and Nina
Allen accidentally discovered that they could detect structure in
cells below the resolution of normal light microscopy while teaching
an advanced microscopy course. The Allens connected a differential
interference contrast microscope to a video camera so that students in
the course could see images without having to look through the
microscope&rsquo;s eyepieces. Nina Allen found that if she changed the
&ldquo;illumination in such a way that the image field was flooded
with light to the point where almost nothing was visible and then
manually adjusted the black level on the video camera, she was able to
see details of cell structure on the video monitor that had never been
seen before&rdquo; (Matlin 2020). Dietrich (2015) analyzes studies of
the motility of protoplasm in slime molds and plants that drew upon
the contributions of the Allens.</p>

<h3 id="ArtCha">4.2 The Artifact Challenge</h3>

<p>
As we have noted, the generation of images of cells generally requires
stains. Since, especially when stains were first introduced, there was
little understanding about what they bound to, skeptics often raised
doubts that they were revealing actual structures in cells (Schickore
2009). Bechtel (2006) highlights three considerations that often
figured in scientists&rsquo; evaluation of whether micrographs were
informative about cells or only artifacts of the methods of
preparation: (1) the quality of the micrographs themselves&mdash;do
they exhibit distinct patterns? (2) the robustness of the
results&mdash;can comparable results be generated with different
techniques (e.g., with light and electron microscopy or with multiple
stains)? and (3) the theoretical plausibility of the results&mdash;do
they fit into a coherent theoretical account? While the first is
seldom commented on in philosophical accounts, it is notable that
scientists are inclined to assume that if an image reveals a distinct,
replicable pattern, it reflects something in the source (although this
assessment may be retracted if, for example, a researcher shows how
the pattern could be generated by other means). There has been
extensive philosophical discussion of the second&mdash;the inference
that when the same result is generated by independent means, it
reflects a preexisting entity in the world (Culp 1995; Stegenga &amp;
Menon 2017). However, this criterion proves insufficient at just the
point at which results with new techniques, such as the electron
microscope, are most controversial&mdash;when the images contain
structures beyond those that can be detected with other existing
techniques. In these cases, the distinctness of the patterns together
with considerations as to the theoretical plausibility of the findings
are the criteria researchers can use. Appeal to theoretical
plausibility, however, would seem to be circular since, in traditional
philosophical accounts, theories are tested by the evidence generated
by the technique. But developing a plausible theory that fits with an
experimental finding and other evidence is not easy and when they are
able to do so, scientists view it as buttressing their judgments that
the images reflect real structures. How cell biologists have invoked
these considerations is examined in philosophers&rsquo; discussions of
two historical cases in which biologists contested whether the
structure shown in microscopic images was real or an artifact. The
cases ended differently, one with the acceptance of the structure, one
with its rejection.</p>

<p>
The first case involves the Golgi apparatus, first described by Golgi
(1898) in light microscope studies using the silver nitrate stain he
had introduced. Palade and Claude (1949a,b), two of the pioneers of
modern cell biology, who would ultimately share the Nobel Prize,
argued that it was an artifact of staining, including with osmium
tetroxide (which Palade helped establish as a primary stain for
electron microscopy), appealing to their ability to create myelin
figures similar in appearance to the Golgi bodies by adding osmium to
egg white. Although Palade remained a skeptic about the Golgi
apparatus for 15 years (researchers in his lab reported that they were
not allowed to mention it during that interval), once researchers in
his laboratory demonstrated that many newly synthesized proteins pass
through the region of the cell where the Golgi apparatus appeared on
their way to being secreted, he accepted it as a cell organelle. In
describing the case, Bechtel (2006) argues it was the discovery that
it figured in an important cell function that led to Palade&rsquo;s
acceptance of it as real and that this is often a major factor in
researchers&rsquo; acceptance of the reality of entities identified
through new techniques.</p>

<p>
The second example stems from early electron microscopy of bacterial
cells. Chapman and Hillier (1953) observed invaginations of the plasma
membrane in gram-negative bacteria, which they called <em>peripheral
bodies</em>. Robertson (1958) renamed them <em>mesosomes</em> and they
were implicated by many researchers in a variety of cell functions
before being rejected as artifacts in the 1970s (Silva et al. 1976).
Analyzing this example, Rasmussen (1993) argues that philosophical
criteria for distinguishing real entities from artifacts, such as
robustness, are insufficient to explain scientists&rsquo; changing
judgments about the mesosome. He argues that Chapman and Hillier
maintained the reality of mesosomes in the course of advancing the
case for use of electron microscopes is the study of bacteria. The
eventual rejection of the mesosome as a real structure, he argues
resulted from competing finding using different techniques. Culp
(1994) challenged Rasmussen&rsquo;s interpretation of the history of
mesosomes, contending that the rejection of mesosomes as an artifact
is in fact best explained on grounds of the robustness of these
competing finding. In a later paper, Rasmussen responds to
Culp&rsquo;s analysis, continuing to maintain that local details, not
principles like robustness, determine scientists&rsquo; judgments
about artifacts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
general principles like robustness are too vague to warrant anything
whatsoever, because when described in sufficient detail it emerges
that the way such principles are instantiated is in flux&mdash;and the
devil is in the details. (2001: 643)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Several other philosophers have further pursued the case of the
mesosome and the arguments that led to its dismissal as an
artifact--see Allchin (2000), Weber (2005), and Hudson (2014: chapter
2).</p>

<p>
Detecting and arguing for artifacts is one example of identifying and
resolving error in science. A common response to a demonstration of
error is that the error must have been the result of poorly done
science. Allchin (2025), however, presents a compelling case that in
making errors, like affirming the existence of mesosomes or denying
the existence of the Golgi apparatus, scientists often advance what
seems to be compelling warrant for their claims. Moreover, he argues
that making such errors is an important feature of science. They
provide the target for research that detects and diagnoses the error,
constituing an advancement in science. Allchin provides detailed
illustration of many such errors and the processes through which they
were diagnosed in the history of science, including in cell
biology.</p>

<h3 id="DiaCelBio">4.3 Diagrams in Cell Biology</h3>

<p>
Microscopic images, whether hand-drawn, as they were in the nineteenth
century, or captured in photographs, are highly detailed or replete
(see discuss of Perini above). However, the knowledge cytologists and
cell biologists seek to develop is more abstract and
general&mdash;they seek to identify the types of structures found in
cells, not all their instances. Accordingly, cell biologists
frequently generate diagrams that leave out details. Maienschein
(1991) examines the origin of this practice in Wilson&rsquo;s (1896)
classic text, <em>The Cell in Development and Inheritance.</em> Early
in the book Wilson provided a diagram
 (<a href="#fig5A">Figure 5A</a>)
 which abstracts from the much more replete photographs he had
presented just a year earlier (Wilson 1895). Instead of showing all
the instances of different organelles, he presents just a few
instances of each type. Organelles are shown using icons that are
suggestive of their shapes. Such diagrams serve to convey the types of
organelles found in cells and their typical location but falsely
suggest that most of the space in the cell is empty. Maienschein
contends that this transition from photographs to abstract diagrams
reflects Wilson&rsquo;s growing confidence in the correctness of his
interpretation of what he was seeing through the microscope and a
transition &ldquo;from presenting data to representing theory&rdquo;
(Maienschein 1991: 252). A sign of their theoretical status is that
such figures, unlike micrographs or data plots, often undergo numerous
revisions as scientists develop their account. Revising these diagrams
is a means, in fact, of developing theory. With the development of
biochemical and molecular accounts of cell phenomena, researchers
often make what Serpente (2011) characterizes as a transition from the
iconic to the symbolic. He presents protein-protein interaction maps
and gene regulatory diagrams as examples of symbolic
representations.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 5</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Similar points also apply to another type of diagram that appears
frequently in cell biology&mdash;diagrams of hypothesized mechanisms
that are taken to be responsible for a particular phenomenon (Sheredos
et al. 2013; Abrahamsen, Sheredos, &amp; Bechtel 2018). Such diagrams
do not try to show all the organelle types but, as in
 <a href="#fig5B">Figure 5B</a>,
 only those thought to be involved in generating a particular
phenomenon&mdash;in this case, the breakdown of materials taken into
the cell (heterophagy) or of cell components themselves (autophagy).
One challenge with mechanism diagrams is that they are static whereas
mechanisms (see entry on
 <a href="../science-mechanisms/">mechanisms in science</a>)
 are engaged in change (the digestion of organelles and the expulsion
of the remaining material). One common strategy is to use arrows to
represent activities, although often within the same diagram arrows
may have multiple different meanings. Ultimately, however, it is up to
the viewer to animate a mechanism diagram (Hegarty 1992)&mdash;to
rehearse mentally the different activities that are represented and to
imagine the changes that are being produced by different parts.</p>

<p>
One might think that diagrams are only important as a means of
illustrating results that are presented textually. But examination of
the practices of cell biologists reveals that they are far more
central to their reasoning. Early in the development of a hypothesis
scientists sketch their ideas (e.g., about how fibroblasts move--see
Cronin and DeMali, 2022). Often diagrams (as well as the other figures
that show data or the workflow of the research) are crafted long
before text is drafted. Diagrams are commonly presented in lab
meetings and revised multiple times as scientists are refining their
claims. Researchers often generate the text of the paper only at the
end of this process. Taking advantage of access to the draft figures
and text for two research projects, Sheredos and Bechtel (2020)
examined the process of interactive engagement in which the
investigators modified diagrams, changed text, and then further
modified the diagram. In one of the cases they examined, an early
version of a diagram serves to pose a question that was addressed
through the experimental studies, resulting in a final diagram that
offers an answer to the question posed.</p>

<p>
Anderson, Dupr&eacute;, and Wakefield (2019), report on a
collaboration between an artist, a philosopher and a cell biologist
engaging in a series of Drawing Labs, one-on-one sessions in which
they explored how scientists can learn to represent the process of
cell division in one connected image. Across three sessions, the
artist encouraged &ldquo;scientists to use drawing to explore the
scope and limits of their knowledge while simultaneously learning
about cell division.&rdquo; Since these first three sessions revealed
difficulties scientists had in breaking out of traditional
&ldquo;structure-based&rdquo; representations of the process, the
artist introduced principles of choreography and the idea of a musical
score as an analogical source to encourage the scientists to think
about mitosis more &ldquo;processually.&rdquo; In the end, the
exercise enabled scientists to formulate a list of questions that were
new to the scientist involved in the project in spite of the fact that
they had been studying cellular processes for twenty years. The study
concludes that &ldquo;[d]rawing shifts the focus from the image as
product &hellip; to the production of the image as an integral part of
research. This activity &hellip; can contribute to scientific insights
and hypotheses.&rdquo; Representing process is often just the
beginning. Jones and Wolkenhauer (2012) show in their analysis of
other diagrammatic representations of cell division how diagrams serve
to locate information required for a computational model in a
representation of the cellular mechanism that is being modeled.</p>

<h2 id="EpiIssIIStrForExpCelActMec">5. Epistemic Issues II: Strategies for Explaining Cell Activities Mechanistically</h2>

<p>
Historically prominent philosophers of science such as Popper and
Reichenbach rejected inquiries into how scientific theories are
discovered as not philosophical (see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-discovery/">scientific discovery</a>).
 Beginning with Hanson (1958), though, discovery has attracted the
interest of many philosophers of science. Investigations into
discovery in cell biology (and related fields such as biochemistry,
molecular biology, and neuroscience) inspired Bechtel and Richardson
(1993 [2010]) to argue that the goal in these fields was not to
construct nomological explanations (Hempel 1965) but rather to
identify the mechanism responsible for a phenomenon and determine how
it worked. Examples from cell biology have also figured prominently in
accounts of mechanistic explanation by Machamer, Darden, and Craver
(2000), Craver and Darden (2013), Bechtel (2006), and others (see
Glennan &amp; Illari, 2018, for a compendium of contemporary accounts
of mechanisms and mechanistic explanation, and the entry
 <a href="../science-mechanisms/">mechanisms in science</a>).
 The concept <em>mechanism</em> figures both in discussion of
ontological issues and epistemic issues, but the two uses can be
distinguished in the manner proposed by G. Allen (2005). In this
section, we are concerned with what he called &ldquo;operative or
explanatory mechanism&rdquo; (2005: 261; the thesis that for
explanatory purposes components of cells should be conceived to
function <em>as if</em> they were machines).</p>

<p>
One of the central objectives of many philosophers of science focused
on mechanistic explanations is to characterize reasoning strategies or
heuristics that scientists use to develop mechanistic explanations
(Bechtel &amp; Richardson 1993 [2010]; Craver &amp; Darden 2013; Gross
2018). We discuss reasoning strategies that figure in different phases
of developing mechanistic explanations in cell biology: delineating
phenomena and situating them in responsible mechanisms, identifying
and characterizing the components of mechanisms (a reductionistic
phase), and determining the organization within mechanisms and between
mechanisms and their contexts (a more holistic phase).</p>

<h3 id="DelCelPheAssTheResMec">5.1 Delineating Cell Phenomena and Associating Them with Responsible Mechanisms</h3>

<p>
Challenging the common characterization of explanations as explaining
data, Bogen and Woodward advanced the claim that scientific
explanations are targeted at phenomena. Instead of defining what
phenomena are, they give examples: &ldquo;weak neutral currents, the
decay of the proton, and chunking and recency effects in human
memory&rdquo; (1988: 306). From these examples, it is clear that Bogen
and Woodward understand phenomena to be repeatable processes that can
be observationally or experimentally detected in multiple ways. On
this characterization, cell activities such as protein synthesis or
cell division count as cellular phenomena. Although phenomena are
often construed as the starting point of research, Craver and Darden
(2013: Chapter 4) identify some of the experimental tasks involved in
characterizing phenomena such as identifying precipitating conditions,
manifestations, inhibiting conditions, modulating conditions, and
nonstandard conditions that alter the manifestation of the phenomenon.
They also emphasize the role of multiple experimental techniques in
specifying features of phenomena. A good deal of research in cell
biology is devoted to determining conditions under which cell
phenomena such as programmed cell death are initiated or inhibited and
cell biologists have been inventive in developing experimental
techniques needed to produce these phenomena. The resulting targets of
explanation in cell biology range from highly specific (protein
synthesis in liver cells under low oxygen conditions) to much more
general (protein synthesis generically). Individual research projects
often address highly specific phenomena whereas textbooks or review
articles discuss more general phenomena.</p>

<p>
While some account of the phenomenon under study is generally adopted
before researchers set out to identify the responsible mechanism, the
characterization often changes radically as research on the
responsible mechanism proceeds. This is illustrated with an example
from the study of cells. A starting point for early inquiries into how
animals store energy for their activities focused on the heat
generated by metabolizing foodstuffs. This heat was assumed to power
other activities and approximately a hundred years of research was
devoted to explaining animal heat (see Mendelsohn 1964). However,
after Lohmann (1929) and Fiske and Subbarow (1929) had identified
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and demonstrated that when hydrolyzed it
would release considerable energy, heat was determined to be just a
waste product of metabolism and researchers instead focused on the
synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP. This became the reconstituted
phenomenon to which much of the older research was now applied.</p>

<p>
Recent philosophical work on characterizing phenomena points out that
the traditional mechanist view tends to render research seeking to
characterize phenomena subordinate to that seeking to explain
phenomena. In response, a number of recent philosophical expositions
argue for more autonomy for investigations of phenomena
vis-&agrave;-vis explanatory investigation and draw on cell biological
practice to make the case. Bollhagen (2021) analyzes how cell
biologists studying the &ldquo;walking&rdquo; motor protein kinesin
recharacterized its &ldquo;stepping pattern&rdquo; in the context of
an experimental practice dedicated solely to characterizing, as
opposed to explaining, this phenomenon. This shows that phenomenon
reconstitution can occur even in the absence of explanatory insights
(see also Bollhagen 2025). Bechtel and Vagnino (2022) discuss how it
took over a century of research in electrophysiology to characterize
electrical potentials in neurons and muscles and the action potential
of neurons. Research devoted to discovering phenomena independently of
attempts to explain it is not unique to cell biology: see Feest 2011,
2017; Cola&ccedil;o 2018, 2020; and Dresow &amp; Love 2025 for other
discussions of phenomenon characterization in related domains of
science.</p>

<h3 id="RedStrDecLoc">5.2 Reductionist Strategies: Decomposition and Localization</h3>

<p>
Most explanations in cell biology decompose cells into the parts or
entities that constitute them and the operations or activities
performed by these entities that contribute to realizing the cellular
phenomenon. Although sometimes researchers can proceed by reasoning
<em>a priori</em> about what component activities would be required to
produce a given phenomenon, most often the decomposition is developed
on the basis of experiments. While the goal is to identify both parts
and operations and to link them, a given group of researchers may only
have research techniques that allow them to identify one or the other.
This was the case in cell biology. As discussed in
 <a href="#WhaCelBio">Section 1</a>,
 microscopic research enabled researchers to identify component parts
(organelles) of cells, but except for indirect clues such as shape or
the ability of an organelle to take up a stain, these researchers were
unable to procure information about the functions they performed.
Biochemists on the other hand were able to identify reactions involved
in many cell activities, but since they studied these in chemical
soups made by grinding up the cell, they were not able to link these
to cell structures. Cell biology developed with the introduction of
new techniques such as cell fractionation and electron microscopy that
opened up the possibility of localizing biochemical reactions in
organelles.</p>

<p>
How scientists pursue reductionistic explanatory strategies like
decomposition and localization can change with the advent of new
instrumentation and techniques. Worlizcek, Matlin and Green (2025)
argue that the development of immunofluorescent microscopy has
provided means of decomposing cell parts and localizing function to
them without physically destroying the cell, as in cell fractionation.
They illustrate what they term <em>exposing</em> cell activities with
research coupling fluorescent probes to antibodies that bind to
specific proteins. This allows cell biologists to spatially localize
specific proteins in cells. Using the spatial location and behavior of
these proteins, now visualizable under the light microscope,
scientists can formulate hypotheses about their function in the cell.
This technique facilitates cell biologists investigating cell
mechanisms reductionistically while heeding what Matlin (2022) argues
is cell biology&rsquo;s distinctive epistemological imperative to
&ldquo;preserve the cellular context.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Additional fluorescence visualization techniques have been developed
since the early 2000s that are collectively labelled
&ldquo;super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.&rdquo; The first of
these was FIONA&mdash;Fluorescence Imaging with One-Nanometer
Accuracy&mdash;developed by Ahmet Yildez while studying the stepwise
movements of molecular motor proteins like myosin and kinesin. This
technique records fluorescence emitted from single dye molecules
attached to a biological system of interest and models the recorded
bright spots as Gaussian functions which enables researchers to
identify the center of the dye and localize the fluorescent tag to
within one nanometer (Wang et al., 2014). Building on FIONA,
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques include
PALM&mdash;Photoactivated Localization Microscopy&mdash;which uses
photoactivatable dye that can be switched on and off with light. By
activating only a few fluorescent tags at a time over thousands of
imaging cycles, this technique avoids generating overlapping spots in
densely packed samples and enables visualization of the distribution
and dynamics of closely spaced subcellular structures (Betzig et al.,
2006). The development and practice of these and other high-resolution
visualization techniques such as MINIFLUX (minimal photon fluxes;
Balzarotti et al. 2017) and fluoRBT (fluorescence rotor bead tracking;
Ivanov et al. 2017) are opening up many new modes to investigate
activities within cells.</p>

<p>
In addition to microscopic techniques taking advantage of
fluorescence, cell biologists have developed a host of other new
technologies for investigating metabolic activities in cells. The
development in the early 2000s of techniques to sequence RNA (RNA-seq)
by first extracting RNA, reverse transcribing it into DNA, and
applying DNA sequencing to identify the sequence of bases in the DNA,
and then determing the RNA makeup of the, which can be a single cell
(Molla Desta &amp; Birhanu, 2025). For a philosophical analysis of the
epistemic challenges involved in RNA-seq, see Tulodziecki (2025). A
variety of imaginge techniques, such as cryo-electron microcopy
(Nogales &amp; Mahamid, 2024) and cryo-electron tomography (Young
&amp; Villa, 2023). While these can only be applied to dead cells,
other researchers are establishing tools for imaging living cells at
increasingly high resolution (Jacquemet, Carisey, Hamidi, Henriques,
&amp; Leterrier, 2020; Laine et al., 2023). These techniques often
provide enormous quantities of data. To deal with this, researchers
have turned to machine learning techniques such as the use of
AlphaFold to determine protein structure (Senior et al., 2020). One
problem to which these techniques have been applied is understanding
the structure and functioning of pores between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm (Schwartz, 2022). Many of these techniques operate at
different spatial and temporal scales, leading to efforts to integrate
results over these scales (McCafferty et al., 2024). As a result of
these and other newly developed techniques, cell biologists now have
many new ways to decompose cells and understand the activities of
their components. These present rich targets for further philosophical
analysis.</p>

<p>
It is worth emphasizing that the sense in which decomposition, both as
traditionally pursued by literally taking cells apart and now through
techniques of imaging structures in living cells, is reductionistic is
very different from that advanced in more traditional philosophical
accounts of theory reduction. Since theory reduction involves the
derivation of one theory from another (Nagel 1961; see the entries on
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">scientific reduction</a>
 and
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>),
 it can only be pursued when there are full theories, some of which
can be derived from the others. Researchers pursue decomposition
without assuming the existence of full theories at either level or
that a theory at one level can be derived from one at a lower level.
Moreover, in pursuing decomposition researchers typically do not
assume that knowledge of the lower-level components is sufficient for
explaining the phenomena&mdash;at a minimum, they recognize that how
the components are organized is also important. The association of a
cell process with a specific enzyme is not the end of the explanatory
process&mdash;the activity of enzymes is often affected by the context
in which the enzyme exists, for example, in a membrane. For this
reason, researchers value <em>in vitro</em> reconstitution experiments
in establishing that they have correctly accounted for a
phenomenon.</p>

<p>
Allchin (1996, 2007), Weber (2002), and Matlin (2016) analyze an
important reconstitution experiment at the interface of cell biology
and biochemistry that played a major role in resolving a conflict
between two opposing accounts of the synthesis of ATP in oxidative
metabolism. Biochemists spent a couple decades trying to identify a
purely chemical pathway that used the energy released in oxidative
metabolism to synthesize ATP (as happens in glycolysis). Peter
Mitchell (1961) advanced an alternative, chemiosmotic hypothesis
according to which energy was transferred via the creation of a proton
gradient over a membrane. Kagawa and Racker (1966) had already linked
ATP synthase to small <em>knobs</em> on the inner mitochondrial
membrane, but it was an <em>in vitro</em> chimeric system combining
fragments from bacteria, plants, and animals created by Racker and
Stoeckenius (1974) that demonstrated that energy could first be
captured in a proton gradient and then used in mitochondria to
synthesize ATP. Unlike purely biochemical accounts that discounted
cell structure, this research showed the importance of not just
enzymes but how they are situated with respect to cell structures in
explaining cellular phenomena. For another example, Matlin (2022)
discusses how biologist G&uuml;nter Blobel&rsquo;s research on the
signal hypothesis&mdash;which explains how proteins are targeted to
specific locations within the cell&mdash;succeeded by developing an
<em>in vitro</em> system that preserved enough of the cell&rsquo;s
topological organization to study these processes in a biologically
meaningful way. By "preserving the cellular context," cell biologists
avoid studying mere "biochemical events" that have no order, location,
or relation to morphological structure in the cell. According to
Matlin, that cell biologists preserve the cellular context is key for
understanding the epistemological distinctiveness of cell biology
vis-&agrave;-vis molecular biology.</p>

<p>
As we noted at the outset, cell biology came into its own as
techniques for decomposing cells into their constituent mechanisms
developed. However, that mechanistic explanation might not be the only
kind of explanation relevant to understanding explanatory practice in
cell biology. Recently Ross (2018, 2021) has argued for distinguishing
pathways from mechanisms (and both from cascades). On her account,
mechanisms address the lower-level machinery through which a
phenomenon is produced whereas a pathway is &ldquo;a sequence of
causal steps that string together an upstream cause to a set of causal
intermediates to some downstream outcome&rdquo; (Ross 2021). Sometimes
what is needed for explanation is just the sequence of steps. We can
explain why a particular city, C, has a supply of corn that is
contaminated, while others do not by appealing to the presence of a
toxin in the corn supply at a certain factory and that roadways
connect this source to city C, but not the others. Ross argues that in
cell biology developmental pathways, signal transduction pathways, and
metabolic pathways provide similar explanations. By showing how cell
biologists seek explanations by a cellular events into pathways Ross
has expanded our understanding of research strategies in cell biology.
For some cell biologists, identifying the pathway often doesn&rsquo;t
represent the end of research. Christensen et al. (2018) have recently
advanced symbolic control analysis as a tool for analyzing pathway
models in order to reach a mechanistic understanding of their
behavior. This promises to be a useful locus for further philosophical
analysis of the relationship between pathways and mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="HolStrChaOrg">5.3 Holistic Strategies: Characterizing Organization</h3>

<p>
Even in chemical soups, individual molecules are arranged in a
particular pattern. This pattern affects, for example, which molecule
encounters another. When analyzing such soups, however, chemists do
not try to decipher the arrangement but instead rely on statistical
measures about the likelihood of encounters. But cells are
different&mdash;different molecules are segregated in different
locations and how they are organized affects the resulting behavior
(this is true even in prokaryotic cells that lack internal membranes,
with molecules segregated in different parts of the cell, sometimes
changing location over the course of a day; see Cohen, Erb,
Selimkhanov, et al., 2014). Organization is also important in
manufactured products. If the parts of your computer were distributed
on your desk, and each part was provided with some input so that it
was performing an operation, the parts would still not carry out the
same activities as they do when they are in their proper arrangement.
Organization ensures that the outputs of one component are passed to
the appropriate others as inputs. The importance of organization is
further recognized when one considers that what human designers do is
impose new organization on existing components to achieve novel
desired effects. Evolution often does the same in biology.</p>

<p>
Organization is especially important for attempts to understand the
activities of cells but, until recently, cell biologists have had to
cleverly use rather limited tools to determine the modes of
organization realized in cells. At a coarse-grained level, the
combination of cell fractionation and electron microscopy provided
information about organization and this provided insight into how
cells perform their activities. For example, recognizing that enzymes
that can break apart cell components are segregated from the rest of
the cell within the lysosome explains why they only carry out their
activities on structures that are first transported into the lysosome.
And knowing that a collection of enzymes is localized in an adjacent
membrane explains how products of one reaction are readily taken up in
another. In these cases the organization realized in cells and its
consequences can be characterized qualitatively and presented in a
mechanism diagram, as discussed in
 <a href="#DiaCelBio">section 4.3</a>.
 In other cases, however, the organization is more complex than can be
described in such qualitative terms. Especially when components are
organized into feedback loops, and the individual operations are
characterized in nonlinear functions, cell biologists turn to
computational models to understand their behavior. Bechtel and
Abrahamsen (2010) and Brigandt (2013) describe a number of examples
from recent research on cell phenomena that require computational
models and refer to the resulting explanations that apply dynamical
analysis to mechanistic accounts as &ldquo;dynamical mechanistic
explanations&rdquo;. Using computational modeling of spindle formation
in cell division as an example, Gross (2018) shows how computational
models can go beyond what has been established experimentally and
serve as heuristics guiding further research.</p>

<p>
In recent years cell biologists have acquired new tools for studying
organization, many of these advanced in systems biology (Green 2017;
see the entry on
 <a href="../systems-synthetic-biology/">philosophy of systems and synthetic biology</a>).
 One approach in systems biology seeks to develop comprehensive
detailed models of the numerous components identified as involved in
specific phenomena (Gross &amp; Green 2017). High-throughput data
about, for example, which proteins in a cell can bind to each other or
which pairs of genes, when mutated together, are lethal, has massively
increased the number of cell components associated with any given
phenomenon. To make sense of this cell researchers often seek abstract
models by constructing networks in which nodes stand for entities and
edges for interactions between entities (Green et al. 2018). The
challenge researchers face is to make sense of these
networks&mdash;given the large number of entities involved and their
many interactions, these networks can often appear as hairballs. We
briefly consider two strategies for analyzing networks in cell biology
that philosophers have analyzed.</p>

<p>
Alon and his collaborators, focusing on gene transcription networks
and metabolic networks in bacteria and yeast, identified
&ldquo;recurring, significant patterns of interconnections&rdquo;
involving two, three, or four nodes, which they called <em>motifs</em>
(Milo et al., 2002: 824). One example, occurring in &ldquo;hundreds of
non-homologous gene systems&rdquo; (Mangan, Zaslaver, &amp; Alon 2003:
197) in the transcription network of <em>E. coli</em>, is the
<em>feedforward loop</em>. In a feedforward loop
 (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>),
 one unit sends inputs to two other units, the first of which also
sends an input to the other, which serves as the final output unit.
Using Boolean models, Alon and his colleagues demonstrated that
depending on whether the connections are excitatory or inhibitory,
such a motif can perform a number of different functions. For example,
if all the connections are excitatory and the final output unit is
only active when it receives input from both of the other units (the
connections to it constitute an AND-gate, as shown on the left in
 <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>),
 then the feedforward loop functions as a persistence
detector&mdash;the output unit only becomes active when the input to
the first unit endures at least until the second unit becomes active.
This, as Mangan et al. explain, protects the output (which might serve
to start the transcription of a gene) from being generated in response
to random noise presented to the input unit. The feedforward loop and
Alon&rsquo;s other motifs are characterized abstractly without
specific reference to what entities and interactions correspond to the
nodes and edges. Philosophers who have examined this research refer to
these organizational patterns as <em>design principles</em> that
enable generalization of explanations without invoking evolutionary
considerations such as adaptation (Green 2015; Green, Levy, &amp;
Bechtel 2015; Bollhagen &amp; Bechtel 2022).</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig6">
<img alt="see text above, 3 diagrams, 2 coherent feedforward loops and 1 incoherent feedforward loop with 'and' and 'or' gates and 'activation' and 'repression' links." src="figure-feedback.svg" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 6:</span> Three examples of feedforward
loops studied by Alon and his colleagues</p>
</div>

<p>
The second strategy employs computational tools such as cluster
analysis to find collections of nodes that are especially highly
interconnected. To interpret these clusters in terms of mechanisms
operative in the cell, researchers often align them with Gene Ontology
(GO), a resource that was developed to represent published information
about cell components, molecular functions, and biological processes
in directed acyclic graphs so as to facilitate communication between
researchers working on different species (Ashburner et al. 2000).
Leonelli (2016) examines many of the epistemic issues the developers
of GO confronted in developing such a resource. Beyond its original
function, GO is now widely used to interpret network graphs
mechanistically. By annotating nodes in cellular networks with
information from GO when it is available researchers interpret these
clusters as corresponding to known mechanisms or sometimes as
constituting previously unknown mechanisms. Researchers make
inferences about nodes for which such information is lacking using
principles such as <em>guilt by association</em>&mdash;the entity is
inferred to occur in the same location or to contribute to the same
process as those with which it clusters (Bechtel 2017 analyzes several
examples).</p>

<p>
As a result of computational models and analyses of large networks,
cell biology in the twenty-first century is much more focused on
organization and appears much less reductionistic than it did in the
mid twentieth century. For some philosophers, this reliance on network
analyses represents a move away from mechanistic explanations towards
a process view (Th&eacute;ry 2015; Nicholson 2018; Dupr&eacute; 2012).
Huneman (2010, 2018) construes the explanations resulting from network
analysis as a distinct type of explanation he labels <em>topological
explanation</em> (see also Kosti&#263; 2020). Some, however, argue
that since these analyses still draw upon the components constituting
the system and the biologists developing them continue to think of
them as mechanistic, we should extend the conception of mechanistic
explanation to include the holistic focus on organization developed in
computational and network analyses (Baetu 2015; Levy 2014). Others,
such as Darrason (2018) and Moreno and Su&aacute;rez (2020), advocate
a pluralist perspective in which mechanisms, networks, and potentially
other explanatory frameworks are integrated to explain various
cellular phenomena. See Burnston (forthcoming) for further discussion of
the dialectic between mechanists and their critics.</p>

<h2 id="SpeDomCelBio">6. Specialized Domains in Cell Biology</h2>

<p>
We have focused on core domains of cell biology, concerned with
explaining the basic activities of cells. There are, though, many
specialized fields concerned with cells. Some of these have become
active areas for philosophical inquiry in their own right. Here we
merely identify some of these and point readers to relevant work by
philosophers, including in several cases entries in the SEP. One such
domain is microbiology, concerned with single-cell organisms, whether
prokaryotic (lacking a nucleus and other organelles) or eukaryotic.
O&rsquo;Malley (2014) has identified distinctive features of
microorganisms (e.g., lateral gene transfer) and explores how features
of microorganismal life challenge major assumptions about living
organisms that have resulted from focusing predominantly on
multi-cellular organisms. In other work (O&rsquo;Malley 2010), she has
examined from a philosophical perspective the competing hypotheses
about the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells.</p>

<p>
Much of cell biology has focused on mature cells of specific types and
has attended less to the processes by which cells in multi-cellular
organisms differentiate from a common cell, known as a <em>stem
cell</em>. Fagan (2013, 2021, 2025) has pioneered the philosophical
examination of stem-cell research, including the advent of techniques
to revert mature cells to stem cells. For additional philosophical
research focused on stem cells, see Laplane and Solary (2019) and
Laplane (2022). Cells are not only transformed in developmental
processes in multi-cell organisms, but also in diseases such as cancer
in which cells not only proliferate in uncontrolled ways but also
defeat many normally operating cellular mechanisms that normally
prevent proliferation (Laplane, 2016, 2018). Plutynski (2018) has
identified these and many other philosophical challenges arising in
the study of cancer (see the entry on
 <a href="../cancer/">cancer</a>
 and Pradeu et al., 2023). An important capability of many multicell
organisms is the ability to detect pathogens, viruses, and other
threats and defend against them. Such immune responses require, among
other things, the capacity to distinguish cells that belong to the
organism itself from others (see the entry on
 <a href="../immunology/">philosophy of immunology</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A fundamental issue that arises in many of these contexts as well as
topics raised above is whether and how one should conceptualize cells
as individuals or agents (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">the biological notion of individual</a>).
 In cancer research, Soto and Sonnenschein (2005; 2018) develop what
they call a &ldquo;tissue organization field theory&rdquo; of
carcinogenesis that they explicitly describe as
&ldquo;emergentist&rdquo; and &ldquo;organicist.&rdquo; They identify
and reject three &ldquo;reductionist&rdquo; assumptions that, they
argue, form the core of the &ldquo;prevailing paradigm&rdquo; in
cancer research: 1) that cancer is derived from a single somatic cell
that has accumulated genetic mutations, 2) quiescence is the default
state of cell proliferation in metazoan, and 3) cancer is due to cell
proliferation caused by mutations in genes that control proliferation.
Rejecting these propositions, Soto and Sonnenschein propose that
proliferation and motility is the &ldquo;default state&rdquo; of cells
and that cancer should be understood as a problem of tissue
organization (rather than one of genes or single cells). On their
view, carcinogens disrupt normal interactions between cells in a
tissue that lead to normal tissue development. As a consequence, the
cells proliferate, as they do by default, but in the absence of the
cues that typically determine cell positionality within the tissue
leading to a disrupted tissue organizational pattern.</p>

<p>
Soto and Sonnenschein&rsquo;s view of the &ldquo;default state&rdquo;
pertains to the foundational ability of cells to generate action and,
therefore, involves the attribution of agency to single-cells, which
Newman et al. (2025) characterize, in general terms, as
&ldquo;behavior intrinsic to an organism and initiated by it.&rdquo;
Mossio, Montevil, &amp; Longo (2016) further develop Soto and
Sonnenschein&rsquo;s idea of the cellular &ldquo;default state,&rdquo;
characterizing it as a &ldquo;fundamental principle for a theory of
organisms&rdquo; (see also Soto, Longo &amp; Noble 2016).</p>

<p>
In addition to approaching cells as objects of scientific study,
contemporary researchers often adopt an engineering approach to cells.
One context is in the domain of synthetic biology in which researchers
engineer cells, sometimes for research ends but other times to
generate products society finds useful (see Meng and Ellis 2020 as
well as the entry on
 <a href="../systems-synthetic-biology/">philosophy of systems and synthetic biology</a>).
 The recent development of gene editing tools such as CRISPR opens up
both epistemic and ethical issues (for the ethical issues, see the
entry on
 <a href="../neuroethics/">neuroethics</a>).
 One context in which attempts to synthesize cells has played a
central role is in the attempt to understand the origins of life. Much
of the research on origins of life involves the development of
protocells&mdash;self-organized, spherical systems composed of lipids
(Rasmussen et al. 2009). Inquiring into how life (cells) began has
become a prominent topic of inquiry for both theoretically minded
biologists and philosophers of biology (see the entry on
 <a href="../life/">life</a>;
 Bedau 2012; Moreno 2016; Dun&eacute;r, Malaterre, and Geppert 2016;
Moreno and Peret&oacute;, forthcoming).</p>
