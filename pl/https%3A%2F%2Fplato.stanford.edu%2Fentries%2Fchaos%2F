<h1>Chaos</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jul 16, 2008; substantive revision Fri Oct 11, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The big news about chaos is supposed to be that the smallest of
changes in a system can result in very large differences in that
system&rsquo;s behavior. The so-called butterfly effect has become one
of the most popular images of chaos. The idea is that the flapping of
a butterfly&rsquo;s wings in Argentina could cause a tornado in Texas
three weeks later. By contrast, in an identical copy of the world sans
the Argentinian butterfly, no such tornado would have occurred in
Texas. The mathematical version of this property is known as sensitive
dependence and such sensitivity has implications for predictability of
future behavior. Clarifying sensitive dependence&rsquo;s significance
is important given there have always been limits on prediction. Chaos
studies have highlighted these implications in fresh ways, enabled
forms of mitigation as well as control of chaos, and have led to other
implications for how we think about our world.</p>

<p>
In addition to exhibiting sensitive dependence, chaotic systems are
deterministic and nonlinear and exhibit aperiodic behavior (Lorenz
1963). This entry discusses systems exhibiting these properties and
their philosophical implications. For those not familiar with the
basic phenomenology of chaos, reading nontechnical treatments such as
Smith (2007) or Bishop (2023) is highly recommended. Because of the
distinctive nature of quantum chaos, it is treated separately in the

<h2><a name="DefChaDetNonSenDep">1. Defining Chaos</a></h2>

<p>
The phenomenon of chaos is studied in disciplines as diverse as
mathematics, astronomy, meteorology, population biology, economics,
and social psychology. While it&rsquo;s unlikely such diverse
disciplines have any causal mechanisms in common, the phenomenological
behavior of chaos&mdash;e.g., sensitivity to the tiniest changes in
initial conditions or seemingly random and unpredictable behavior that
nevertheless follows precise rules&mdash;appears in many models in
these disciplines. Observing similar chaotic behavior in models across
such diverse fields presents a challenge to understanding chaos as a
phenomenon and what might count as unification of such phenomena.</p>

<h3><a id="Prelim">1.1 Preliminaries</a></h3>

<h4><a name="DynSysDet"> 1.1.1 Dynamical Systems and Determinism</a></h4>

<p>
Chaos is typically understood as a property of a dynamical system. A
dynamical system is a deterministic mathematical model for how
observable properties of a system evolve with time. Time can be either
discrete or continuous. A one-dimensional dynamical system is called a
map (though the literature sometimes deviates from this usage). As an
example of a discrete map, imagine a rule where you place one penny on
the first square of a checkerboard, two on the second square, three on
the third square, and so on. The output or number of pennies on each
square represents a step in time. This is an iterative process meaning
that the current value of a variable at time \(t\), the number of
pennies has the rule applied to it yielding the value of the variable
at the next time step \(t+1\). Then the rule is applied to this value
producing the output at the next time step \(t+2\) and so forth. A
time series is built up of outputs from the map for each time step.
The number of pennies on square one (\(t\)), square two (\(t+1\)),
square three (\(t+2\)) and so on would be an example of a discrete
time series produced by iterating a map.</p>

<p>
Dynamical systems of two dimensions or higher are called flows. Flows
can also be discrete or continuous and their outputs also form a time
series albeit of two or more dimensions.</p>

<p>
Such models may be studied as mathematical objects or used to describe
a target system (e.g., physical, biological, or economic). A simple
example would be the equation describing the motion of a pendulum. The
equations of a dynamical system describe the evolution in time of
variables taken to adequately describe the target system (e.g.,
velocity as a function of time for a pendulum). A complete
specification of the initial state of such equations is referred to as
the initial conditions for the model, while a characterization of the
boundaries for the model domain are known as the boundary conditions.
An example of a dynamical system with a boundary condition would be
the equation modeling the flight of a rubber ball fired at a wall by a
small cannon. The boundary condition might be that the wall absorbs no
kinetic energy (energy of motion) so that the ball is reflected off
the wall with no loss of energy. The initial conditions would be the
position and velocity of the ball as it left the mouth of the cannon.
The dynamical system would then describe the flight of the ball to and
from the wall under these conditions.</p>

<p>
A mathematical model is deterministic if it exhibits unique
evolution:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(Unique Evolution)</strong> A given state of a model is always
followed by the same history of state transitions. Given a state at a
specific time there is only one history of transitions consistent with
the relevant laws.</p>

<p>
Although some popularized discussions of chaos claim it invalidates
determinism, chaotic behavior is always deterministic. Much of the
confusion over chaos and determinism derives from equating determinism
with predictability. While it&rsquo;s true that apparent randomness
can be generated if the state space (see
 <a href="#StaSpaFaiModAss">&sect;1.1.3</a>
 below) one uses to analyze chaotic behavior is coarse-grained, this
produces only an epistemic form of nondeterminism. The underlying
equations are still fully deterministic. For a breakdown of
determinism in chaotic systems, there must be some kind of
indeterminism introduced such that the property of unique evolution is
violated (see
 <a href="#ChaDetQuaMec">&sect;4</a>
 and
 <a href="#ChaDet">&sect;6.1</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
Dynamical systems exhibit various kinds of attractors, a value (or set
of values in the case of a flow) that trajectories converge onto in
state space. There are four kinds of attractors:</p>

<ol>

<li>Fixed points: The dynamical system repeats the same value.</li>

<li>Periodic loops: The dynamical system produces periodically
repeating values such as the small hand of a clock pointing to 12
every 60 seconds.</li>

<li>Quasi-periodic loops: The dynamical system produces values
exhibiting a regular pattern but which don&rsquo;t have a fixed period
such as the tides rolling in and out. Such attractors can also exhibit
behavior with two or more periods of incommensurable frequencies
(i.e., frequencies which are not rational multiple of each
other).</li>

<li>Aperiodic: The dynamical system produces values that appear to
never repeat but intricate order exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The intricate order of aperiodic attractors is where the phenomenon of
chaos lies.</p>

<p>
When a dynamical system&rsquo;s trajectory narrows down onto an
attractor it&rsquo;s said to be dissipative. Dissipative dynamical
systems have the property that their activity shrinks to a smaller
area or volume in state space (see
 <a href="#StaSpaFaiModAss">&sect;1.1.3</a>).
 In contrast, conservative dynamical systems, also called Hamiltonian,
preserve state space area or volume. Chaotic behavior is exhibited in
both dissipative and conservative dynamical systems.</p>

<h4><a name="NonDyn">1.1.2 Nonlinear Dynamics</a></h4>

<p>
The dynamical systems of interest in chaos studies are nonlinear, such
as the Lorenz (1963) model equations for convection in fluids:</p>

<p>

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= -\sigma x + \sigma y; \\
 \tag{Lorenz} \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= rx - y + xz ; \\
 \frac{dz}{dt} &amp;= xy - bz.\\
 
\end{align*}\]
 </p>

<p>
A dynamical system is characterized as linear or nonlinear depending
on the nature of the equations describing the target system. Consider
a differential equation system \(d\bx/dt = \bF\bx\) for a set of
variables \(\bx = x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\). These variables might
represent positions, momenta, chemical concentration, or other key
features of the target system, and the system of equations describes
how these key variables change with time.</p>

<p>
Let \(\bx_{1}(t)\) and \(\bx_{2}(t)\) be solutions of the equation
system \(d\bx/dt = \bF\bx\). If the system of equations is linear, it
can easily be shown that \(\bx_{3}(t) = a\bx_{1}(t)+ b\bx_{2}(t)\) is
a solution, where \(a\) and \(b\) are arbitrary constants. This is
known as the principle of linear superposition. If the principle of
linear superposition holds, then a system behaves linearly: Any
multiplicative change in a variable by a factor \(\alpha\) implies a
multiplicative or proportional change of its output by \(\alpha\).</p>

<p>
Suppose you start with your stereo at low volume and turn the volume
control one unit. The volume increases by one unit. If you now turn
the control two units, the volume increases two units. This is an
example of a linear response. In a nonlinear system, such as
Lorenz&rsquo;s, linear superposition fails, and a system need not
change proportionally to the change in a variable. If you turn your
volume control too far, the volume may not only increase more than the
number of units of the turn, but whistles and various other
distortions occur in the sound. These are examples of a nonlinear
response.</p>

<h4><a name="StaSpaFaiModAss">1.1.3 State Space and the Faithful Model Assumption</a></h4>

<p>
Mathematical models of physical systems involve state space, an
abstract mathematical space of points. Each point represents a
possible state of the system. When the state of the system is fully
characterized by position and momentum variables, the resulting space
is often called phase space, though some authors use the term phase
space for any state space. A dynamical system is a rule for how a
model behaves in state space. A state is taken to be characterized by
the values of the variables considered crucial for a complete
description of said state and its behavior. The dimensionality of the
state space is determined by the number of independent variables
needed to characterize the system state.</p>

<p>
In addition to the variables characterizing the state, a dynamical
system also has one or more parameters determining the strength of the
contributions of particular terms in the mathematical model to the
model&rsquo;s behavior. The initial state as well as the mathematical
model and its parameters are important to chaotic dynamics.</p>

<p>
For a map, the first number inputted&mdash;the initial state&mdash; is
iterated producing a trajectory in state space, a series of state
transitions creating a time series. Similarly for a flow, where as
many numbers as there are dimensions for the state space serve as the
initial state. A model can be studied in state space by following its
trajectory from the initial state to some chosen final state. The
equations describe the path&mdash;the history of state
transitions&mdash;of the system in state space. Often working in state
space enables study of useful geometric properties of the dynamical
system&rsquo;s trajectories without knowing the exact solutions to the
equations.</p>

<p>
Scientists presume a close connection between the model used to
forecast weather, say, and the weather system being tracking. However,
note some crucial, often unexamined, assumptions. For instance, that
the state of a target system, such as weather, is characterized by the
values of the crucial state space variables and that a physical state
corresponds via these values to a point in state space. The
implication is that the target system&rsquo;s state represented in
state space corresponds to the actual-world system of interest and
that the possibilities encoded in the state space correspond to the
actual-world system&rsquo;s physical possibilities.</p>

<p>
These assumptions allow development of mathematical models for
behavior in state space and such models are taken to represent
(perhaps through an isomorphism or some more complicated relation) the
target systems of interest. Mathematicians and scientists assume that
our mathematical models are faithful representations of target systems
and that the state spaces employed faithfully represent the actual
possibilities of target systems. This package of suppositions is the
faithful model assumption. In its idealized limit&mdash;the perfect
model framework&mdash;it can license the (perhaps sloppy) slide
between model talk and system talk (i.e., whatever is true of the
model is also true of the target system and vice versa).</p>

<p>
Given faithfulness, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think we can plot
trajectories for both the target system and its model in the same
state space for comparison. In the context of nonlinear models,
faithfulness appears to be inadequate
 (<a href="#NonModFaiCon">&sect;3</a>).</p>
 
<h3><a name="BriHisCha">1.2 A Brief History of Chaos</a></h3>

<p>
While some scientists and mathematicians prior to the 20th century
explored the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions
(SDIC) for system behavior, these isolated investigations never
produced a sustained field of inquiry. For instance, James Clerk
Maxwell identified behavior resembling SDIC (1876, p. 13). He
described such phenomena as cases where the &ldquo;physical
axiom&rdquo; that from like antecedents flow like consequences is
violated. He recognized this kind of behavior could be found in
systems with a sufficiently large number of variables. But he also
argued that such sensitive dependence could happen in the case of two
colliding spheres (1860).</p>

<p>
Closer to our modern notion of SDIC in the growth of uncertainties is
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s example of a cyclone, where observational
error of &ldquo;one-tenth of a degree&rdquo; leads to apparent
randomness in landfall creating prediction difficulties (1921, p.
398).</p>

<p>
Study of small disturbances&rsquo; impact on system behavior
intensified with a famous paper by Edward Lorenz (1963). His
pioneering work demonstrated that a meteorological model could exhibit
exquisite sensitive dependence on small changes in initial
conditions.</p>

<p>
Three benchmarks for characterizing uncertainty growth are linear,
exponential, and geometric growth rates. Linear growth is represented
by the expression \(y = ax+b\), where \(a\) is an arbitrary positive
constant and \(b\) is an arbitrary constant. A special case of linear
growth is illustrated by stacking pennies on a checkerboard \((a =
1\), \(b = 0)\). Using the rule of placing one penny on the first
square, two pennies on the second square, three pennies on the third
square, and so forth, we&rsquo;ll end up with 64 pennies stacked on
the last square. The total number of pennies on the checkerboard will
be 2080.</p>

<p>
Exponential growth is represented by the expression \(y =
n_{0}e^{ax}\), where \(n_{0}\) is some initial quantity (say the
initial number of pennies) and \(a\) is an arbitrary positive
constant. Going back to our penny stacking analogy with \(a = 1\),
start with placing 1 penny on the first square, about 2.7 pennies on
the second square, about 7.4 pennies on the third square, and so
forth, resulting in about \(6.2 \times 10^{27}\) pennies staked on the
last square! This is an example of a nonlinear map.</p>

<p>
Finally, there are faster than exponential growth
 rates<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>,
 but exponential uncertainty growth is considered an important mark of
chaotic dynamics. Thus, these faster growth rates are usually ignored
in chaos discussions.</p>

<p>
The other behavior Lorenz&rsquo;s model demonstrated was aperiodicity.
Aperiodic solutions don&rsquo;t repeat their behavior (at least on
reasonable timescales; demonstrating solutions never repeat on a
computer is very difficult).</p>

<p>
Aperiodicity was treated as an uninteresting mathematical oddity until
the publication of Lorenz (1963) demonstrating model solutions that
wouldn&rsquo;t repeat their behavior because they had a deep
relationship to the
 <a href="../nonwellfounded-set-theory/self-similar-sets.html">Cantor set</a>.
 Lorenz&rsquo;s work indicated aperiodicity had practical
implications.</p>

<p>
Lorenz (1963) usually represents the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; of chaos.
The earliest use of the term &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; to describe the
phenomenon Lorenz reported was in David Ruelle and Floris Takens
(1971); the term &ldquo;strange attractor&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#ReaCha">&sect;5.1</a>
 below) also first appears in this paper. Nonetheless, it was
Tien-Yien Li&rsquo;s and James A. Yorke&rsquo;s (1975) influential
&ldquo;Period Three Implies Chaos&rdquo; paper that led to the
widespread use of the term &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; for these mathematical
behaviors.</p>

<h3><a name="DefCha">1.3 Defining Chaos</a></h3>

<p>
To identify systems as chaotic, we need a definition or a list of
distinguishing characteristics.</p>

<h4><a name="QualDefCha">1.3.1 Qualitative Definitions of Chaos</a></h4>

<p>
The logistic map,</p>

<p>

\[x _{t+1}= \alpha x_{t}(1-x_{t}), \]
 </p>

<p>
where \(\alpha\) is a parameter whose value ranges from one to four
and the variable \(x\) ranges from zero to one, is a model chaotic
system. A definition of chaos should identify what makes such a
dynamical system chaotic, but this turns out to be a difficult task.
Stephen Kellert defines chaos theory as &ldquo;the qualitative study
of unstable aperiodic behavior in deterministic nonlinear dynamical
systems&rdquo; (1993, p. 2). His definition picks out two key features
that are simultaneously present: instability and aperiodicity.
Unstable systems are those exhibiting sensitivity to initial
conditions, where Kellert gestures towards Robert Devaney&rsquo;s
definition, and examples of qualitatively different behaviors (1993,
p. 12). Aperiodicity we&rsquo;ve already
 met.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This definition is both qualitative and restrictive. It&rsquo;s
qualitative in that Kellert doesn&rsquo;t rely on mathematically
precise criteria for instability and aperiodicity. Although one can
add such definitions, this precision may only add limited improvements
(see below). The definition is restrictive in that it limits chaos to
be a property of mathematical models (although Kellert (1993) is
sometimes ambiguous as to whether chaos is only a behavior of
mathematical models or of actual-world systems), so the import for
actual-world systems is left open. At this point, we must invoke the
faithful model assumption&mdash;namely, that our mathematical models
and their state spaces have close correspondence to actual-world
target systems and their possible behaviors&mdash;to forge a link
between this definition and chaos in actual systems. Immediately we
face two related questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>How faithful are our models? How strong is the correspondence with
target systems? This relates to issues in realism and explanation
 (<a href="#QueAboReaExp">&sect;5</a>)
 as well as confirmation
 (<a href="#NonModFaiCon">&sect;3</a>).</li>
 
<li>Do features of our mathematical analyses (e.g., characterizations
of instability) turn out to be problematic such that their application
to target systems may not be useful (see below)?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Furthermore, Kellert&rsquo;s definition is too broad to pick out only
chaotic behaviors. For instance, take the map \(x_{n + 1} = cx_{n}\),
a map exhibiting only unstable and aperiodic orbits. For the values
\(c = 1.1\) and \(x_{0} = .5\), successive iterations continue to
increase and never return near \(x_{0}\). Kellert&rsquo;s definition
would classify this map as chaotic, but the map doesn&rsquo;t exhibit
chaotic behavior.</p>

<p>
Robert Batterman&rsquo;s (1993) discusses problematic definitions of
chaos, namely, those focusing on notions of unpredictability.
Unpredictability is neither necessary nor sufficient to distinguish
chaos from any other unpredictable behavior
 (<a href="chaotic-hierarchy.html">Supplement: The Chaotic Hierarchy</a>).
 Batterman doesn&rsquo;t specify an alternative definition but
suggests exponential growth in uncertainty is a necessary condition
while leaving open whether it&rsquo;s sufficient.</p>

<p>
However, a crucial feature of chaos is the presence of
&ldquo;stretching and folding&rdquo; mechanisms in the dynamics
(Batterman 1993, p. 49). Such mechanisms cause some trajectories to
converge rapidly while causing others to diverge rapidly leading to
trajectories issuing from various points in some small neighborhood of
state space mixing and separating in dramatic ways. For instance, some
initially neighboring trajectories on the Lorenz attractor (Figure 1)
become separated, where some end up on one wing while others end up on
the other wing rather rapidly. As another example, the logistic map
stretches the interval \([0,1]\) and folds it from a straight line
into a parabola. Successive iterations repeat this stretching and
folding process eventually producing chaotic dynamics for appropriate
values of the parameter \(\alpha\).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="lorenz.svg" style="width:80%" alt="A closed yellow curve on a plain black backround. The curve spirals around and around into two large sets of concentric ovals that connect to each other at the bottom and angle away from each other at the top." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1.</span> The Lorenz Attractor.</p>
</div>

<p>
Stretching of trajectories is associated with the explosive growth in
uncertainties, folding with confinement to a region of state space.
The presence of appropriate stretching and folding mechanisms in the
dynamics, Batterman argues, is a necessary condition for chaos. Such
behavior is associated with nonlinearities. As such, this defining
characteristic could be applied to both mathematical models and
actual-world systems, though the identification of such mechanisms in
target systems may be rather tricky: When dealing with a fluid system,
say, we have several nonlinear mechanisms that have been well explored
as sources for stretching and folding. In contrast, when we only have
time series data (e.g., the hourly price of Chicago Board of Trade hog
futures), identifying possible nonlinear mechanisms is difficult.</p>

<p>
Stretching and folding mechanisms lead to dynamics with attractors, so
focusing on such mechanisms in developing a definition of chaos
appears fruitful. From a qualitative standpoint we have determinism,
nonlinearity, stretching and folding dynamics, aperiodicity, and SDIC
as factors relevant to a definition identifying chaotic behavior
fitting our intuitions for chaos.</p>

<h4><a name="QuanDefCha">1.3.2 Quantitative Definitions of Chaos</a></h4>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with distinguishing weak and strong forms of
sensitive dependence (somewhat following Smith 1998). Weak sensitive
dependence can be characterized as follows. Consider the propagator,
\(\bJ(\bx,\Delta t)\), where trajectories \(\bx(t+\Delta t) =
\bJ(\bx,\Delta t)\) . Let \(\bx(0)\) and \(\by(0)\) be initial
conditions for two different trajectories. Then, weak sensitive
dependence is</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(WSD)</strong>
<br />
\(\exists \varepsilon \gt 0\) \(\forall \bx(0)\) \(\forall \delta \gt
0\) \(\exists t\gt 0\) \(\exists \by(0)\), \(\abs{\bx(0) - \by(0)} \lt
\delta\) and \(\abs{\bx(t) - \by(t)} \gt \varepsilon.\)</p>

<p>
No matter how close together \(\bx(0)\) and \(\by(0)\) are the
trajectory initiating from \(\by(0)\) will eventually diverge by
\(\varepsilon\) from the trajectory initiating from \(\bx(0)\).
However, WSD doesn&rsquo;t specify the rate of divergence (it&rsquo;s
compatible with linear rates of divergence) nor does it specify how
many points surrounding \(\bx(0)\) will give rise to diverging
trajectories (it could be a set of measure zero).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, chaos is usually characterized by a stronger form
of sensitive dependence:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(SD)</strong>
<br />
\(\exists \lambda\) such that for almost all points \(\bx(0)\),
\(\forall \delta \gt 0\) \(\exists t\gt 0\) such that for almost all
points \(\by(0)\) in a small neighborhood \((\delta)\) around
\(\bx(0)\), \(\abs{\bx(0) - \by(0)}\lt \delta\) and \(\abs{\bx(t) -
\by(t)} \approx \abs{\bx(0) - \by(0)}e^{\lambda t}\),</p>

<p>
where &ldquo;almost all&rdquo; is understood as applying for all
points in state space except a set of measure zero. Here, \(\lambda\)
is often interpreted as the largest global Lyapunov exponent
 (<a href="global-lyapunov-exponents.html">Supplement: Global Lyapunov Exponents</a>)
 and is taken to represent the average rate of divergence of
neighboring trajectories issuing forth from some small neighborhood
centered around \(\bx(0)\). Exponential growth is implied if \(\lambda
\gt 0\) (convergence if \(\lambda \lt 0)\). In general, such growth
cannot go on forever. If the system is bounded in space and momentum,
there are limits to how far nearby trajectories can diverge from one
another.</p>

<p>
One strategy for devising chaos definitions is to begin with discrete
models and generalize to the continuous case. If one begins with a
continuous system by using a Poincar&eacute; surface of
section&mdash;roughly, a two-dimensional plane is defined and one
plots the intersections of trajectories of a flow with this
plane&mdash;a discrete model can be generated. If the discrete model
generated by the surface of section exhibits chaotic behavior, the
original continuous system will also be chaotic.</p>

<p>
Let \(f\) be a smooth function defined on state space \(S\). \(f\) can
be iterated or reapplied a number of
 times.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 To indicate this, we can write \(f^{n}(x)\), meaning \(f\) is applied
iteratively \(n\) times. For instance, \(f^{3}(x)\) would indicate
\(f\) has been applied three times, thus \(f^{3}(x) = f(f(f(x)))\).
The logistic map is a simple example of this iterative procedure.
Furthermore, let \(K\) be a subset of \(S\). Then \(f(K)\) represents
\(f\) applied to the set of points \(K\), that is, \(f\) sends the set
\(K\) into \(f(K)\). If \(f(K) = K\), then \(K\) is an invariant set
under \(f\).</p>

<p>
Now Devaney&rsquo;s (1989) definition of chaos can be stated as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p class="nobottommargin">
<strong>(Chaos\(_{d})\)</strong>
<br />
A smooth map \(f\) is chaotic if \(f\) has an invariant set
\(K\subseteq S\) such that</p>

<ol class="notopmargin">

<li>\(f\) satisfies WSD on \(K\),</li>

<li>The set of periodic orbits of \(f\) are dense in \(K\), and</li>

<li>\(f\) is topologically transitive on \(K\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Topological transitivity is the following notion: consider open sets
\(U\) and \(V\) around the points \(u\) and \(v\) respectively.
Regardless how small \(U\) and \(V\) are, some trajectory initiating
from \(U\) eventually visits \(V\). This condition guarantees
trajectories starting from points in \(U\) will eventually explore all
of \(S\).</p>

<p>
Devaney&rsquo;s definition is often favored by mathematicians and has
the virtues of being precise and compact. Since the time he proposed
his definition, it has been shown that (2) and (3) imply (1) if the
set \(K\) has an infinite number of elements (Banks et al<em>.</em>
1992), although this result doesn&rsquo;t hold for sets with finite
elements. The definition is counterintuitive in that it emphasizes
periodic orbits rather than aperiodicity, when the latter is a much
better characterization of chaos. After all, it&rsquo;s precisely the
lack of periodicity that is characteristic of chaotic behavior.
However, if the set of nonstable periodic points is dense in \(K\),
then given (3) the abundance of aperiodic orbits characteristic of
chaos is guaranteed. Some have argued that (2) is not even necessary
for characterizing chaos (e.g., Robinson 1995, pp. 83&ndash;4).
Furthermore, nothing in Devaney&rsquo;s definition hints at the
stretching and folding of trajectories (e.g., linear models can
exhibit WSD), which appears to be a necessary condition for chaos from
a qualitative perspective. Peter Smith (1998, pp. 176&ndash;7)
suggests that Chaos\(_{d}\) is a consequence rather than a mark of
 chaos.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A possibility for capturing the concept of the stretching and folding
of trajectories so characteristic of chaotic dynamics is the
following:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(Chaos\(_{h})\)</strong>
<br />
A discrete function \(f\) is chaotic if, for some iteration \(n \ge
1\), it sends the unit interval \(I\) into a horseshoe.</p>

<p>
Consider the Smale horseshoe: Start with the unit square. First,
stretch it in the \(y\) direction by more than a factor of two. Then
compress it in the \(x\) direction by more than a factor of two. Now,
fold the resulting rectangle and lay it back onto the square so that
the construction overlaps and leaves the middle and vertical edges of
the initial unit square uncovered. Repeating these stretching and
folding operations leads to the Smale attractor.</p>

<p>
This definition has at least two virtues. First, it can be proven that
Chaos\(_{h}\) implies Chaos\(_{d}\). Second, it yields exponential
divergence, so we get SD as expected for chaotic systems.
Nevertheless, it has a significant disadvantage in that it cannot be
applied to invertible functions, the kinds of functions characteristic
of many systems exhibiting Hamiltonian chaos. A Hamiltonian system is
one where the total kinetic energy plus potential energy is conserved;
in contrast, dissipative systems lose energy through some mechanism
such as friction. Hamiltonian chaos, then, is chaotic behavior in a
Hamiltonian system and a definition for chaos must be able to cover
both conservative and dissipative systems.</p>

<p>
Other possible definitions have been suggested in the literature. For
instance (Smith 1998, pp. 181&ndash;2),</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(Chaos\(_{te})\)</strong>
<br />
A discrete function is chaotic just in case it exhibits topological
entropy.</p>

<p>
Roughly, given points in a neighborhood \(N\) around \(x(0)\) less
than \(\varepsilon\) away from each other, after \(n\) iterates of
\(f\) the trajectories initiating from the points in \(N\) will differ
by \(\varepsilon\) or greater, where more and more trajectories will
differ by at least \(\varepsilon\) as \(n\) increases. For maps,
however, it can be shown that Chaos\(_{h}\) implies Chaos\(_{te}\), so
this doesn&rsquo;t look to be a basic definition, though it&rsquo;s
often more useful for proving theorems relative to the other
definitions.</p>

<p>
Some authors advocate characterizing chaos in terms of notions from
ergodic theory (e.g., Berkovitz, Frigg, and Kronz 2006; Sklar 1995,
pp. 235&ndash;4; see the
 <a href="chaotic-hierarchy.html">Supplement: The Chaotic Hierarchy</a>).</p>
 
<h4><a id="LyaExpSenDep">1.3.3 Lyapunov Exponents and Chaos</a></h4>

<p>
The most popular candidate definition for chaos among scientists and
philosophers is</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>(Chaos\(_\lambda\))</strong>
<br />
A function is chaotic if it has a positive global Lyapunov
exponent.</p>

<p>
This definition takes SD as its base with \(\lambda\) as the global
Lyapunov exponent. The meaning of positivity is that \(\lambda &gt;
0\) for almost all points in the specified set \(S\). Moreover, it
offers practical calculation advantages for mathematical models and
can often be related (sometimes with difficulty) to experimental data
in the sense of examining data sets generated from physical systems
for the presence of global Lyapunov exponents.</p>

<p>
The global Lyapunov exponent is a parameter characterizing the average
growth rate of any uncertainty. This average rate is estimated over
many initial conditions. Such exponents can be thought of as
indicating the stretching rate per time step of a function averaged
over a trajectory. In this context, stretching is the rapid divergence
of neighboring trajectories away from each other and is related to the
presence of nonlinearities in the mathematical model.</p>

<p>
The usefulness of Lyapunov exponents as potential diagnostics is
illustrated by comparing the values of the Lyapunov exponents for the
logistic map with its bifurcation diagram (e.g., Bishop 2023, pp.
54&ndash;55). The sign of the global Lyapunov exponent tracks with the
bifurcation behavior. This tracking is always the case for chaotic
mathematical models. Studying such relationships reveals a larger set
of parameter values leading to stable behavior compared to chaotic for
all dynamical systems.</p>

<p>
One advantage of Global Lyapunov exponents is that they provide a
convenient measure of the growth in the uncertainty giving some
insight into system predictability. A common measure of predictability
horizon for a system is the doubling rate \(2^t\), a measure of when
the uncertainty grows to twice that in initial data as \(t\)
increases. In linear systems, it takes a very long time for the
uncertainty to grow to twice that of the initial data. For chaotic
behavior, the doubling time is \(2^{\lambda t}\) because the growth in
uncertainty is thought to be a pure exponential with exponent
\(\lambda\).</p>

<h4><a name="TroLyaExpSenDep">1.3.4 Trouble with Definitions</a></h4>

<p>
All the definitions discussed suffer counterexamples (see
 <a href="definition-trouble.html">Supplement: Chaos Definition Counterexamples</a>):</p>
 
<ol>

<li>Systems exhibiting WSD can fail to have positive global Lyapunov
exponents.</li>

<li>Attempts to align definitions such as Chaos\(_{d}\) , SD,
Chaos\(_{te}\), or <span class="nw">Chaos\(_{\lambda}\)</span> with
the ergodic hierarchy yield examples with exponential divergence of
trajectories where all past states are perfectly correlated with any
future states yielding no randomness associated with chaos.</li>

<li>Some cases with positive global Lyapunov exponents have
trajectories accelerating off to infinity raising questions about the
importance of requiring confinement.</li>

<li>Even for bounded systems, the presence of a positive global
Lyapunov exponent may not lead to exponential growth in
uncertainties.</li>

<li>Some systems exhibit SDIC and generate dense periodic orbits, but
lack topological transitivity raising questions about Chaos\(_{d}\),
SD, Chaos\(_{te}\), and Chaos\(_{\lambda}\).</li>

<li>Aperiodic horocyclic flows on a compact surface of negative
curvature are ergodic and satisfy conditions (2) and (3) for
Chaos\(_{d}\) but never exhibit even WSD.</li>

<li>Periodic horocyclic flows on a compact surface of negative
curvature can have a positive global Lyapunov exponent, but
aren&rsquo;t dense in the subspace challenging SD, Chaos\(_{te}\), and
Chaos\(_{\lambda}\).</li>

<li>KAM-type systems raise question about strong mixing as either a
necessary or sufficient condition for chaos.</li>

<li>Chaos\(_{d}\) or strong mixing classify much linear behavior as
chaotic.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In light of this, one might suggest a modification to Devaney&rsquo;s
definition:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p class="nobottommargin">
<strong>(Chaos\(_{d\text{exp}}\))</strong>
<br />
A smooth map \(f\) is chaotic if \(f\) has an invariant set
\(K\subseteq S\) such that</p>

<ol class="notopmargin">

<li>\(f\) satisfies SD on \(K\),</li>

<li>The set of periodic orbits of \(f\) are dense in \(K\), and</li>

<li>\(f\) is topologically transitive on \(K\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
This definition has the virtue of all three conditions being
independent of each other while clearly distinguishing linear from
nonlinear behavior reserving chaotic dynamics for the latter. This
fits most closely with intuitions of exponential growth in
uncertainties as well as a dense set of aperiodic orbits matching
researchers&rsquo; expectations for chaotic behavior.</p>

<p>
Chaos\(_{d\text{exp}}\) agrees with intuitions that WSD is too weak to
capture chaotic
 dynamics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Specifying SD plus a set of dense periodic points and topological
transitivity rules out cases where there is (1) a positive global
Lyapunov exponent and no randomness, (2) a positive global Lyapunov
exponent and no exponential growth in uncertainties, (3) a set of
dense periodic points and topological transitivity but no positive
global Lyapunov exponent, (4) KAM-type systems, and (5) linear
dynamics. Although likely not immune to some counterexamples, this
definition gets closer to characterizing the phenomenology of chaotic
dynamics.</p>

<p>
In practice, it&rsquo;s the average Lyapunov exponents that are
calculated to demonstrate when exponential growth in uncertainties
occurs
 (<a href="global-lyapunov-exponents.html">Supplement: Global Lyapunov Exponents</a>).
 This means that what really gets plugged into a definition such as
chaos\(_{d\text{exp}}\) is an average global Lyapunov exponent; one
can always examine the step-by-step finite-time exponents for detailed
information about the attractor.</p>

<p>
Finally, as the phenomenology of chaotic dynamics illustrates,
mathematical models only exhibit SDIC for particular parameter values
(Bishop 2023). Although often ignored in discussions about defining
chaos, sensitive dependence on parameter settings shouldn&rsquo;t be
<span  class="nw">neglected.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
 
<h3><a name="DefTakSto">1.4 Taking Stock</a></h3>

<p>
The image of butterfly wings flapping in Argentina leading to a
tornado forming in Texas three weeks later suggests stringent limits
on predictability. Given the resolution constraints on our weather
models, there&rsquo;s no way for us to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the butterfly
wings disturbing the air currents that eventually lead to the tornado.
Nonetheless, predictability is not a lost cause.</p>

<p>
Consider an iterated map with the following behavior: the initial
uncertainty grows by a factor of four on the first iteration, by a
factor of three on the second iteration, by a factor 1/3 on the third
iteration, by a factor of four on the fourth iteration, and a factor
of two on the fifth iteration. This is behavior is similar to local
Lyapunov exponents. While uncertainty has grown by a factor of 32 by
the fifth iteration, the geometric average growth in uncertainty is
only a factor of two per iteration. Although uncertainty growth
isn&rsquo;t uniform, the geometric average gives some useful
information about predictability for this system. It&rsquo;s even the
case that the uncertainty shrinks on some iterations. Knowing
specifics about the dynamics involved affords greater predictability
on some iterations than others. For another example, consider the
logistic map. For values of \(x\) close to zero or one the uncertainty
grows rapidly, while for values around .5 uncertainty shrinks. These
growth rates hold true when the logistic map exhibits chaotic
behavior. Even for the Lorenz system there are regions in state space
where uncertainties decrease, meaning forecasting the future is quite
good in these regions even with chaotic dynamics (Shen et al.
2018).</p>

<p>
In actual-world forecasting, scientists deal with finite uncertainties
and their growth, often not computing Lyapunov exponents. Consider a
typical weather forecasting scenario. Scientists take measurements of
the initial state of their system (e.g., temperature, pressure,
humidity, etc. in some region) yielding ensembles of initial
conditions. One reason they have to deal with ensembles is all
measurements have accuracy limitations introducing some uncertainties
into the observed values. Scientists then use data assimilation
processes to transform observations into the model state space
(remember the faithful model assumption
 <a href="#StaSpaFaiModAss">&sect;1.1.3</a>).
 This forms a model of the initial conditions for the forecasting
model. Using these they can run their forecasting model to produce an
ensemble forecast: On 30% of the model runs using the ensembles, rain
is predicted for Washington, D. C. tomorrow.</p>

<p>
The chaotic dynamics of weather systems is a real thing, but
scientists have techniques for coaxing good, useful forecasting for
such systems over the near and medium-range future. Your evening
weather forecast is still quite useful even though chaotic dynamics
exists. Hence, the idea that chaotic systems are unpredictable is a
myth.</p>

<p>
There is no consensus regarding a precise definition of chaotic
behavior among mathematicians and scientists, although mathematicians
often prefer Chaos\(_{d}\) and scientists typically prefer
Chaos\(_{\lambda}\). The latter definition, however, is trivially
false for finite uncertainties in actual-world systems
 (<a href="global-lyapunov-exponents.html">Supplement: Global Lyapunov Exponents</a>)
 and of limited applicability for mathematical models unless
reformulated using average Lyapunov exponents. Different definitions
have varying strengths and weaknesses regarding tradeoffs on
generality, theorem generation and proving, calculation ease, number
of counterexamples, and so forth. The best candidates for necessary
conditions for chaos still appear to be (1) something like
chaos\(_{d\text{exp}}\) or (2) the presence of stretching and folding
mechanisms. Chaos\(_{d\text{exp}}\) may function as a sufficient
condition for chaos in many circumstances.</p>

<p>
These definitions may only hold for our mathematical models, but not
be applicable to actual-world systems. Formal definitions seek to
fully characterize chaotic behavior in mathematical models, but
we&rsquo;re also interested in capturing chaotic behavior in physical
and biological systems. Phenomenologically, actual-world systems
exhibit features such as SDIC, aperiodicity, predictive limits,
instability under small perturbations, and apparent randomness. Since
target systems run for only finite time and uncertainties are always
larger than infinitesimal, such systems violate the assumptions
necessary for deriving global Lyapunov exponents. Even if we have good
statistical measures yielding on-average exponential growth in
uncertainties for a data set, what guarantees that this corresponds
with the exponential growth of Chaos\(_{\lambda}\)? After all, any
growth in uncertainties can be fitted with an exponential. If there is
no physical significance to global Lyapunov exponents (because they
only apply to infinitesimal uncertainties), then one is free to choose
any parameter to fit an exponential for the growth in uncertainties.
One needs the control provided by calculating local Lyapunov exponents
(preferably by variational methods).</p>

<p>
Are our attempts at definitions inadequate? Is there only one
definition for chaos, and if so, is it only a mathematical property or
also a physical one? Do we, perhaps, need multiple definitions (some
of which are inequivalent) to adequately characterize such complex and
intricate behavior? Is it reasonable to expect that the
phenomenological features of chaos of interest to physicists and
applied mathematicians can be captured in precise mathematical
definitions given that there may be irreducible vagueness in the
characterization of these features? From a physical point of view, is
a phenomenological characterization sufficient for the purpose of
identifying and exploring underlying mechanisms responsible for the
stretching and folding of trajectories? Answers to these questions
largely lie in our inquiry purposes (e.g., proving rigorous
mathematical theorems vs. detecting chaotic behavior in physical data
vs. designing systems to control such behavior).</p>

<p>
Chaos only exists in nonlinear systems (at least for classical
macroscopic systems; see
 <a href="quantum-chaos.html">Supplement: Quantum Chaos</a>
 for quantum chaos subtleties). Nonlinearity is a necessary condition
for stretching and folding mechanisms, so would seem to be a necessary
condition for chaotic behavior. Yet, there&rsquo;s an alternative way
to characterize systems in which such stretching and folding takes
place: nonseparability.</p>

<p>
As discussed in
 <a href="#NonDyn">&sect;1.1.5</a>,
 linear systems always obey the principle of linear superposition. The
Hamiltonians describing such systems are always separable. A separable
Hamiltonian can be transformed into a sum of separate Hamiltonians
with one element in the sum corresponding to each subsystem. In
effect, the interactions among subsystems can be transformed away
leaving the subsystems independent of each other. The whole is the sum
of the parts, as it were. Chaos is impossible for separable
Hamiltonians.</p>

<p>
By contrast, interactions in nonlinear systems cannot be decomposed
into individual independent subsystems. Consequently the whole system
and its environment cannot be ignored. Nonseparable classical systems
are where chaotic behavior can manifest itself. Therefore, one could
say that nonseparability of a Hamiltonian is a necessary condition for
stretching and folding mechanisms and, hence, for chaos (e.g., Kronz
1998). The nonseparability of Hamiltonians may be more relevant for
understanding potential quantum chaotic behavior.</p>

<p>
As a practical matter, mathematicians and scientists describe and
apply various definitions of chaos to both the character of the state
space trajectories issuing forth from initial conditions as well as to
the equations defining the dynamical systems. What one wants to avoid
are overly simple &ldquo;tests&rdquo; for chaos that risk simply
finding some form of exponential growth in a noisy data set and
pronouncing that &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; as one measure is up to the task
(e.g. Toker, Sommer, and D&rsquo;Esposito 2020).</p>

<h2><a name="WhaChaThe">2. What is Chaos &ldquo;Theory&rdquo;?</a></h2>

<p>
One often finds references in the literature to &ldquo;chaos
theory.&rdquo; For instance, Kellert characterizes chaos theory as
&ldquo;the qualitative study of unstable aperiodic behavior in
deterministic nonlinear systems&rdquo; (Kellert 1993, p. 2).&nbsp;Is
chaos a theory in the same sense that electrodynamics or quantum
mechanics (QM) are theories?</p>

<p>
One difficultly answering such questions is the lack of consensus
about what a theory is (see the entry on
 <a href="../structure-scientific-theories/">the structure of scientific theories</a>)
 . Scientists often treat theories as systematic bodies of knowledge
that provide explanations and predictions for actual-world phenomena.
Being more precise than this generates significant differences for how
to conceptualize theories. Options range from axiomatic or syntactic
views of the logical empiricists (see the entry on the
 <a href="../vienna-circle/">Vienna Circle</a>)
 to semantic or model-theoretic views (see the entry on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>),
 to Kuhnian (see the entry on
 <a href="../thomas-kuhn/">Thomas Kuhn</a>)
 and less rigorous conceptions of theories. Axiomatic views appear to
be inapplicable to chaos. There are no chaos axioms&mdash;no chaos
laws&mdash;no deductive structures, no linking of observational
statements to theoretical statements in the chaos literature.
Meanwhile, there are many chaotic models but these occur in a variety
of scientific theories and no shortage of popularizations referring to
chaos as a &ldquo;new paradigm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Kellert&rsquo;s (1993) focus on chaos models is suggestive of semantic
views, and much chaos literature focuses on models. Briefly, on
semantic views, a theory is characterized by (1) a set of models and
(2) hypotheses linking models with idealized physical systems. The
mathematical models discussed in the literature are concrete and
fairly well understood, but what about the hypotheses linking chaos
models with idealized physical systems? In the chaos literature,
there&rsquo;s a great deal of discussion of various robust or
universal patterns and the kinds of predictions that can or cannot be
made using chaotic models. Moreover, there&rsquo;s a lot of emphasis
on qualitative predictions, geometric mechanisms, and patterns, but
this all comes up short of spelling out hypotheses linking chaos
models with idealized physical systems.</p>

<p>
Chaos models are deployed to ascertain various kinds of information
about bifurcation points, period doubling sequences, the onset of
chaotic dynamics, strange attractors, and other denizens of the chaos
zoo. Hypotheses connecting chaos models to actual-world systems need
filling in if we&rsquo;re to employ the semantic conception fully
(e.g., how strange attractors reconstructed from physical data relate
to the physical system from which the data were originally
recorded).</p>

<p>
Currently no good candidates for laws of chaos over and above the laws
of classical physics exist, and some, such as Kellert, explicitly deny
chaos laws exist (1993, ch. 4). Furthermore, the relationship between
the state spaces of chaotic models and the spaces of idealized
physical systems is quite delicate, a dissimilarity with analytical
mechanics. In analytical mechanics, we seem to be able to translate
between models and state
 spaces.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 In chaotic dynamics, we can derive a state space for chaotic models
from the full nonlinear model (e.g., using a Poincar&eacute; surface
of section), but we cannot reverse the process and get back to the
nonlinear model state space using that generated chaotic model. One
might expect the hypotheses connecting chaos models with idealized
physical systems to piggy back on the hypotheses connecting classical
physics models with their corresponding idealized physical systems.
But it&rsquo;s unclear how this would work in the case of nonlinear
models in classical physics let alone for chaotic models in biology,
economics and other
 disciplines.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Problems arise from thinking about the faithful model assumption:
What&rsquo;s the relationship between model and target system? Is it
one-to-one as standardly assumed? Or is it one-to-many (several
different nonlinear models of the same target system or, potentially,
vice versa) or a
 many-to-many?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 When linear models or force functions are used in Newton&rsquo;s
second law, the translation between model and target system appears to
be straightforwardly one-to-one. In nonlinear contexts, where one
might construct a model from data generated by observing a system,
potentially many nonlinear models can be constructed, where each model
is empirically adequate to the system behavior. Is there really only
one unique model for each target system and we simply don&rsquo;t know
the True one (say, because of underdetermination problems&mdash;see
the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-realism/">scientific realism</a>
 and see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-underdetermination/">underdetermination of scientific theory</a>)?
 Or is there really no one-to-one relationship between mathematical
models and target systems?</p>

<p>
Moreover, an important feature of semantic views is that models are
only intended to capture crucial features of target systems and always
involve various forms of abstraction and idealization (see the entry
on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>).
 Any errors in nonlinear models for such systems, no matter how
accurate our initial data, lead to errors in predicting actual-world
systems over time. This highlights a problem with the faithful model
assumption masked in the context of linear systems: Models can be
erroneous by leaving out &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; factors and, at
least for reasonable times, our model predictions don&rsquo;t differ
significantly from target systems behavior (wait long enough, however,
and such predictions will differ significantly, though this length of
time may exceed time scales of interest). In nonlinear contexts, by
contrast, it&rsquo;s not clear there are any &ldquo;negligible&rdquo;
factors. The smallest omission in nonlinear models can lead to
disastrous effects because of the differences these terms would have
made versus their absence (see
 <a href="#NonModFaiCon">&sect;3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Another possibility is to drop hypotheses connecting models with
target systems and simply focus on models themselves in the spirit of
the mathematical theory of dynamical systems. The focus is on models
and their relations, but little emphasis on hypotheses connecting with
actual systems, idealized or otherwise. Unfortunately, this would mean
that chaos theory is only a theory about models.</p>

<p>
Both syntactic and semantic views of theories focus on the formal
structure of theoretical bodies of knowledge, and their
&ldquo;fit&rdquo; with theorizing about chaotic dynamics seems quite
problematic. In contrast, perhaps one should conceive of chaos theory
in a more informal or paradigmatic way, say along the lines of
Kuhn&rsquo;s (1996) analysis of scientific paradigms (see the section
on
 <a href="../thomas-kuhn/#ConcPara">the concept of a paradigm</a>
 in the entry on Thomas Kuhn) No emphasis on the precise structure of
scientific theories; rather, theories are cohesive, systematic bodies
of knowledge defined by the roles they play in normal science practice
within a dominant paradigm. A very strong sense in chaos literature is
that a &ldquo;new paradigm&rdquo; has emerged emphasizing unstable
rather than stable behavior, dynamical patterns rather than
mechanisms, universal features (e.g., Feigenbaum&rsquo;s constant)
rather than laws, and qualitative understanding rather than precise
prediction.</p>

<h2><a name="NonModFaiCon">3. Nonlinear Models, Faithfulness, and Confirmation</a></h2>

<p>
Scientists consider models to be simplified mathematical descriptions
of key variables and processes of target systems under study.
There&rsquo;s a tight connection between the model used to produce a
weather or Sunspot forecast, say, and the state space of variables
thought important to track. This is the faithful model assumption, a
direct enough correspondence between model state in state space and
the actual-world&rsquo;s possible states through these key variables
and processes.</p>

<p>
Invoking the faithful model assumption, there are two basic approaches
to model confirmation discussed in the philosophical literature on
modeling following a strategy known as piecemeal
 improvement.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 One basic approach focuses on successive refinements to the accuracy
of initial data while keeping the model fixed (e.g., Koperski 1998).
As uncertainty in the initial data is reduced, a faithful
model&rsquo;s behavior should converge to the target system&rsquo;s
behavior. The faithful model assumption implies that if one plots the
trajectory of the target system in an appropriate state space, model
trajectories in the same state space should monotonically become more
like the system trajectories on some measure as the data is <span  class="nw">refined.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
 
<p>
The other basic approach focuses on successive model refinements while
keeping the initial data fixed (e.g., Koperski 1998). After all, if a
model is faithful in reproducing the behavior of the target system,
refining the model should produce even better fit with the target
system&rsquo;s behavior. Again, the faithful model assumption implies
that if one were to plot target system trajectories in an appropriate
state space, model trajectories in the same state space should
monotonically become more like the system&rsquo;s as the model is made
more realistic.</p>

<p>
Piecemeal strategies&rsquo; intuitive appeal for linear models is
clear: Small changes in the magnitude of a variable are guaranteed to
yield proportional changes in model output. Making small improvements
in a faithful linear model &ldquo;in the right direction&rdquo; in
either initial data or the model can be tracked by improved model
performance. The qualifier &ldquo;in the right direction,&rdquo;
drawing upon the faithful model assumption, means the data quality and
accuracy really is increased or the model really is more realistic
(captures more features of the target system in an increasingly
accurate way), and is signified by the model&rsquo;s monotonically
improved performance with respect to the target system.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, piecemeal approaches encounter serious difficulties in
nonlinear contexts, where the principle of linear superposition fails.
Successive small refinements in initial data used by nonlinear models
isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to lead to convergence between model and target
system behaviors. Small refinements &ldquo;in the right
direction&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t guaranteed to lead to a nonlinear model
monotonically improving in capturing the target system&rsquo;s
behavior; it can lead to model behavior diverging away from system
 behavior.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Similarly, keeping data fixed but making successive model refinements
isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to lead to convergence between model and target
system behaviors. With loss of linear superposition, small changes in
the model can lead to non-proportional changes in model behavior. Even
if a small refinement is made &ldquo;in the right direction,&rdquo;
there&rsquo;s no guarantee nonlinear models will monotonically improve
in capturing target system behaviors. A small refinement can lead to
model behavior diverging away from system behavior.</p>

<p>
Intuitively, piecemeal convergence strategies look to be dependent on
the perfect model framework. Given a perfect model, refining the
quality of the data should lead to monotonic convergence between model
and target system behaviors, but this expectation isn&rsquo;t always
justifiable for perfect models (cf. Judd and Smith 2001; Smith 2003).
On the other hand, given good data, perfecting a model intuitively
should lead to monotonic convergence between model and target system
behaviors.</p>

<p>
Even perfect models don&rsquo;t live up to our intuitions (Judd and
Smith 2001; Judd and Smith 2004). For example, no matter the number of
system observations, there will be a set of trajectories in the model
state space indistinguishable from the actual trajectory of the target
system. Even for infinite past observations, we cannot eliminate the
uncertainty in the epistemic states given some unknown ontological
state of the target system. No matter how faithful the nonlinear model
state space is to the physical possibilities of the target system, no
matter how fine-grained the model state space, there will always be
many more target system states than model states for any computational
models since the equations must be discretized (Bishop 2023).</p>

<p>
In principle, when we can develop a fully analytical model, there
could be an exact match between the number of possible model states
and target system states. However, such analytical models are rare in
complexity
 studies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 Recall the shift map. As a mathematical model it&rsquo;s
perfect&mdash;specifying periodic initial conditions for the map
result in periodic orbits with no uncertainty. Yet, specifying even
the smallest amount of uncertainty in the initial conditions leads to
rapid amplification of uncertainty in the map&rsquo;s orbits.
Similarly, even a perfect nonlinear model will amplify any uncertainty
in initial conditions.</p>

<p>
Therefore, perfect models don&rsquo;t guarantee monotonic improvement
with respect to target system behavior. This is the upshot of the
failure of the principle of linear superposition. No matter how
faithful the model, no guarantee exists for piecemeal monotonic
improvement of nonlinear model behavior with respect to target
 systems.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For nonlinear models, faithfulness can fail and piecemeal
perfectibility cannot be guaranteed, raising questions about
scientific modeling practices and our understanding of them when
linear superposition fails. Similarly, policy assessment utilizing
model forecasts (e.g., economic and pandemic modeling) is also
affected by the same lack of guarantee as model confirmation. Such
problems remain largely unexplored in philosophy of science, but there
are mitigation strategies (Bishop 2023; Smith 2000).</p>

<p>
Lack of perfect measurements further complicates nonlinear modeling
for chaos in actual-world systems. While modeling discussions often
assume it&rsquo;s possible in principle to reduce measurement errors
to arbitrary accuracy, this is more hope than sound reasoning. Suppose
arbitrarily accurate measurement processes are possible. Perfect
measurement accuracy still isn&rsquo;t attainable because error
reduction is a limiting process. Perfect measurement accuracy requires
infinite precision for any chaotic model. As the supposed measurement
process is refined, information storage needs will exceed the capacity
of universe because the information needed to account for accuracy
grows exponentially without limit.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, there&rsquo;s another limit to measurement accuracy: Any
measurement apparatus introduces some small disturbance into systems
being
 measured.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Even if measurement inaccuracy is reduced to zero, the act of
measurement introduces disturbances into the True state of the system
being observed meaning uncertainty will be amplified (not to mention
small disturbances due to minute fluctuations in gravity and
electromagnetic fields owing to the movement of scientists and their
vehicles, etc.). Completely accounting for all these effects on
chaotic system exceeds the data storage capacity of the universe.</p>

<p>
The upshot is that the perfect model framework underestimates
difficulties dealing with uncertainty when modeling nonlinear systems
exhibiting chaos. Scientists realize this and generally exercise care
when analyzing and modeling actual-world situations.</p>

<h2><a name="ChaDetQuaMec">4. Chaos, Determinism and Quantum Mechanics</a></h2>

<p>
Some authors have argued SDIC opens a door for quantum influences in
&ldquo;infect&rdquo; chaotic macroscopic systems (e.g., Barone et al.
1993; Hobbs 1991; Kellert
 1993).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 The central argument runs as follows and is known as the sensitive
dependence argument (SD argument):</p>

<ol type="A">

<li>For systems exhibiting SDIC, trajectories starting in a highly
localized region of state space will diverge on-average exponentially
fast from one another.</li>

<li>Quantum effects limit the precision with which physical systems
can be specified to a neighborhood in state space of no less than a
magnitude of \(1/(2\pi/h)^{N}\), where \(h\) is Plank&rsquo;s constant
and \(N \) is the dimension of the system in
 question.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>Given enough time, two trajectories of the same chaotic system
will have future states localizable to a much larger region \(\delta\)
in phase space (from (A) and (B)).</li>

<li>Therefore, quantum effects will influence systems exhibiting SDIC
leading to violations of unique evolution
 (<a href="#DynSysDet">&sect;1.1.3</a>).</li>
 </ol>

<p>
As a concrete example, consider a damped driven pendulum exhibiting
chaotic behavior so it&rsquo;s sensitive to small effects. If a photon
strikes the pendulum, in principle a minute amount of momentum from
the photon can be transferred to the pendulum affecting the behavior
of a macroscopic system.</p>

<p>
The SD argument doesn&rsquo;t go through as smoothly as its advocates
claim, however. The appropriate version of QM (e.g., von Neumann,
Bohmian, or decoherence theories; see the entry on
 <a href="../qm/">quantum mechanics</a>),
 the nature of quantum measurement theory (collapse vs. non-collapse
theories; see the discussion of
 <a href="../qt-issues/#MeasProb">the measurement problem</a>
 in the entry on philosophical issues in quantum theory), the
selection of the initial state characterizing the system, and the
system-apparatus cut must be resolved before one can say clearly
whether unique evolution is violated (e.g., Bishop 2008). For example,
if indeterminism in QM isn&rsquo;t ontologically genuine, then
whatever contribution quantum effects make to macroscopic systems
exhibiting SDIC wouldn&rsquo;t violate unique evolution. In contrast,
if QM is genuinely indeterministic, then the possibility may exist for
quantum effects to influence macroscopic system. However, damping due
to friction can place constraints on how quickly amplification of
quantum effects takes place before being completely washed out.
Moreover, if the photon deposits its momentum contribution to a
chaotic pendulum when the local Lyapunov exponents are negative, then
the quantum effect will dissipate rather than amplify.</p>

<h2><a name="QueAboReaExp">5. Questions about Realism and Explanation</a></h2>

<p>
Although not well explored in the context of chaos, there are
interesting questions regarding both realism and explanation deserving
further investigation.</p>

<h3><a name="ReaCha">5.1 Realism and Chaos</a></h3>

<p>
Is chaos only a property of mathematical models? Consider the
Feigenbaum constant. Computing it for period doubling in physical
systems, such as flowing fluids, chemical reactions, or lasers, yields
values very close to \(-4.6992016091\), the value for the logistic
map. Yet, the logistic map has no discernible relationship to these
quite different physical systems.</p>

<p>
Consider the damped driven pendulum. The mathematical model describing
it exhibits chaos for some combinations of the values of parameters
for the magnitude of friction and magnitude and frequency of driving
force. Constructed pendula with these parameter values behave
chaotically as the model predicts. Eventually, the magnitude of the
working coefficient of friction and the driving frequency of the motor
varies due to components heating up and chaotic behavior is lost.
Chaotic behavior is persistent in our mathematical model while
relatively short lived in physical pendula illustrating that
mathematical models can often be inadequate representations of the
material world even when relevant variables and parameters are
included.</p>

<p>
Given these actual-world phenomena, chaos raises a number of questions
about
 <a href="../scientific-realism/">scientific realism</a>
 only some of which will be touched on here. First and foremost,
scientific realism is usually formulated as a thesis about the status
of unobservable terms in scientific theories and their relationship to
actual-world entities and processes. But there are serious questions
about formulating a theory of chaos
 (<a href="#WhaChaThe">&sect;2</a>),
 let alone determining how this theory fares under scientific realism.
It&rsquo;s more reasonable to discuss some less ambitious realism
questions regarding chaos: How well do our chaos models track with
actual phenomena? Do the various denizens of chaos, such as fractals,
actually exist?</p>

<p>
Problems with Lyapunov exponents raise the tracking question. While
it&rsquo;s relatively straightforward to calculate exponents for
simple mathematical systems, such as the Logistic map, it&rsquo;s more
difficult to calculate them for dynamical systems such as
Lorenz&rsquo;s equations. And it&rsquo;s harder still&mdash;perhaps
impossible sometimes&mdash;to measure Lyapunov exponents for physical
systems using their time series data.</p>

<p>
Another tracking question is illustrated by a peculiar geometric
structure of dissipative chaotic models called a strange attractor,
which can form based upon the stretching and folding of trajectories
in state space. A characteristic feature of strange attractors is
self-similar structure. Magnify any small portion of the attractor and
the magnified portion looks identical to the original region. Magnify
the magnified region and identical structure is repeated again.
Continuous repetition of this process yields the same results over and
over. An important geometric implication of self-similarity is that
there&rsquo;s no inherent size scale in state space so any
magnification of a region of the attractor yields statistically
similarly structure.</p>

<p>
Strange attractors are often characterized by noninteger or fractal
 dimension.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 The type of dimensionality we encounter in everyday experience is
characterized by integers. A point has dimension zero; a line has
dimension one; a square has dimension two; a cube has dimension three
and so on. In contrast, the dimensionality of the butterfly strange
attractor for the Lorenz system in Figure 1 is 2.0627160 (Viswanath
 2004).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 The presence of strange attractors in Lorenz or time series data from
an experiment indicates the chaotic behavior under study is
dissipative (conserves neither state space volume nor energy) rather
than Hamiltonian (conserves both).</p>

<p>
A warning is in order because detecting fractals in a time series
doesn&rsquo;t mean the dynamics of the system generating that time
series is deterministic. For instance, the fractal dimension of the
Cantor set is approximately 0.631, yet it&rsquo;s possible to produce
a nondeterministic generator for Cantor-like sets. Therefore, focusing
on the fractal alone doesn&rsquo;t imply a deterministic process
produced it. This same example illustrates that detecting a fractal in
a time series doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the system producing it is
chaotic. While dissipative chaotic systems will have fractal
attractors, not all dissipative systems having fractal attractors will
be chaotic (Ott 1992, pp. 233&ndash;236).</p>

<p>
Although there&rsquo;s no universally accepted definition for strange
attractors or fractal dimension among mathematicians, the more serious
question is whether strange attractors and fractal dimensions are
properties of our models only or also of actual-world systems. For
instance, empirical investigations of actual-world systems indicates
there&rsquo;s no infinitely repeating self-similar structure like that
of strange attractors (Avnir, et al. 1998; Shenker 1994). Self-similar
structure is repeated on only two or three spatial scales in the
reconstructed state space. This is a prefractal, where self-similar
structure only repeats on a finite number of length scales.</p>

<p>
The dissipative chaotic models used to characterize some actual-world
systems exhibit strange attractors with fractal geometries.
What&rsquo;s the relationship of infinite fractal geometries in
chaotic model state spaces to the pre-fractal features of actual-world
systems? Fractal features of such models clearly are false of target
systems though the models themselves may still be useful for helping
scientists locate interesting dynamics characterized by prefractal
properties.</p>

<p>
There are caveats to thinking fractals are fictions, however. The
prefractal character of analyzed data sets could be an artifact of the
way data is massaged before it&rsquo;s analyzed or due to the
analog-to-digital conversion that must take place before data analysis
can begin. Reducing real-number-valued data to finite strings of
digits would destroy fractal structure as would the conversion of real
numbers to integers in measurement processes.</p>

<p>
QM offers a reason to suspect physical systems cannot have such
self-repeating structures &ldquo;all the way down.&rdquo; Strange
attractors are supported in classical state spaces because an infinity
of length scales supporting smooth curves are possible. Quantum state
spaces, by contrast, cannot support infinitely fine length scales
because of Planck&rsquo;s constant. Hence, we&rsquo;re applying a
classical model carrying a tremendous amount of excess, fictitious
structure to understand features of physical systems. One of the key
structures playing a crucial role in chaos
explanations&mdash;infinitely intricate structure of strange
attractors&mdash;is absent from the corresponding physical system.</p>

<p>
Peter Smith (1998, ch. 3) argues such false models are justified
because the infinitely intricate structure of strange attractors (1)
is the result of stretching and folding mechanisms, and (2) many of
the points in state space of interest are invariant under this
stretching and folding mechanism. The infinite structure is merely
geometric extra baggage, but the stretching and folding leading to
period-doubling sequences, onset of chaos, and so forth are real
enough. This is an antirealist move about some key elements of
explanation in chaos
 (<a href="#NatChaExp">&sect;5.2</a>)
 and has been criticized as such (Koperski 2001). Jeffrey Koperski
(2001) has also challenged the strategy of throwing out what appears
to be excess mathematical structure (e.g., strange attractors&rsquo;
topological transitivity) when we need such structure for
quasi-periodic attractors.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re back to the faithful model assumption: Model equations
faithfully capture target systems&rsquo; behavior and model state
spaces faithfully represent target systems&rsquo; actual
possibilities. Is the sense of faithfulness that of actual
correspondence between mathematical models and features of
actual-world systems? Or can faithfulness be understood in terms of
empirical adequacy alone, a primarily instrumentalist construal? Is a
realist construal of faithfulness threatened by the mapping between
models and systems potentially being one-to-many or many-to-many?</p>

<p>
A related question is whether mathematical models are simulating or
merely mimicking target system behavior. To simulate a system suggests
there&rsquo;s some genuine correspondence between a model and the
actual-world target system it&rsquo;s designed to capture. In
contrast, to merely mimic the behavior of a target system suggests
there&rsquo;s no genuine correspondence to actual properties of the
target system other than correlation. These issues become crucial for
modern techniques of building nonlinear dynamical models from large
time series data sets (e.g., Smith 1992). In such cases, after
performing some tests on the data set, the modeler constructs a
mathematical model reproducing the time series as the model&rsquo;s
output. Do such models only mimic behavior of target systems? What of
realism?</p>

<p>
What about an alternative account of realism,
 <a href="../structural-realism/">structural realism</a>,
 which focuses on the causal structures in well-confirmed scientific
hypotheses and theories? The kinds of universal structural features
identified in chaotic phenomena in realms as diverse as physics,
biology, and economics is suggestive of some form of structural
realism and look to play key roles in chaos explanations. Significant
questions about infinitely repeating self-similar structure not being
realized in physical systems remains. One still faces the difficulty
that strange attractors of our mathematical models are at best too
gross an approximation to the structure of physical attractors and at
worst terribly misleading.</p>

<p>
Other kinds of geometric structures associated with chaos would
qualify on a structural realist view. After all, it also seems to be
the case that realism for chaos models has more to do with
processes&mdash;namely stretching and folding mechanisms at work in
target systems. But here the connection with realism and chaos models
would come indirectly via an appeal to causal processes at work in the
full nonlinear models taken to represent physical systems. Perhaps
there is a way to arrive at more realistic chaos models via prefractal
attractors.</p>

<h3><a name="NatChaExp">5.2 The Nature of Chaos Explanations</a></h3>

<p>
Chaos is invoked as an explanation for or contributing substantially
to actual-world behaviors such as epileptic seizures, heart
fibrillation, neural processes, chemical reactions, weather, and
industrial control processes. Chaotic dynamics is also invoked to
explain features such as the actual trajectories exhibited in a given
state space. But what&rsquo;s the role chaos plays in these various
explanations?</p>

<p>
The nature of scientific explanation (see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/">scientific explanation</a>)
 in the literature on chaos is thoroughly under-discussed. Traditional
accounts for scientific explanation such as covering-law, causal
mechanical, and unification models all present drawbacks when applied
to chaotic phenomena. For instance, if there are no universal laws
lying at the heart of chaos explanations, covering-law models
don&rsquo;t look promising as candidates for chaos explanations.</p>

<p>
Causal-mechanical models of explanation maintain that sciences provide
understanding of diverse facts and events by showing how these fit
into the causal structure of the world. If chaos is a behavior
exhibited by nonlinear systems, then it&rsquo;s reasonable to think
there are some mechanisms or processes standing behind this behavior.
Chaos is typically understood to be a property of the dynamics of such
systems, and dynamics presumably reflects the processes at work and
their interactions. Links between causal mechanisms and behaviors in
the causal-mechanical model are supposed to be reliable connections
along the following lines: If mechanism \(C\) is present, behavior
\(B\) typically follows. Chaos explanations, then, provide reliable
connections between mechanisms and the chaotic behavior exhibited by
systems containing such mechanisms.</p>

<p>
Unification accounts of explanation hold that sciences provide
understanding of diverse facts and events by showing how these may
result from a much smaller set of explanatory factors (e.g., laws or
causes). One can argue chaos is a set of a limited number of patterns
and tools (e.g., stretching and folding) for explaining characteristic
behaviors found in diverse phenomena spread across physics, chemistry,
biology, economics, social psychology, and so forth.</p>

<h4><a name="ExpFaiModCha">5.2.1 Explanation, Faithful Models and Chaos</a></h4>

<p>
Typical causal and unification accounts presuppose theories are in
place, where models of those theories play an explanatory role. In
causal accounts, processes are key components of the models. In
unification accounts, laws might be the ultimate explanatory factors,
but we often connect laws with physical systems via processes. To be
explanatory, however, such accounts must make the faithful model
assumption; namely, that our models and state spaces are faithful
representation of actual-world systems.</p>

<p>
As discussed in
 <a href="#NonModFaiCon">&sect;3</a>,
 it&rsquo;s not straightforward to confirm nonlinear models are good
explanations when chaotic dynamics is present, because slight
refinements to initial conditions or models can lead to markedly
differing behavior. Therefore, on many standard approaches to model
confirmation, it&rsquo;s difficult to say when we have a good
explanation even for perfect models (Judd and Smith 2001).</p>

<p>
We could either search for processes yielding stretching and folding
in the dynamics (causal form of explanation) or for common properties
underlying the behavior of nonlinear systems of interest (unification
form of explanation). Nevertheless, it appears that the properties to
which one appeals on unification accounts pick out the patterns of
chaos we want to understand: How do these properties arise? We want
unification accounts that avoid citing the very phenomena in need of
explanation as explanatory factors.</p>

<p>
Suppose we appealed to strange attractors in our models or in state
space reconstruction techniques. Modulo worries raised in
 <a href="#ReaCha">&sect;5.1</a>,
 even if the presence of a strange attractor in the state space was
both necessary and sufficient for a model being chaotic, this
wouldn&rsquo;t amount to an explanation of chaotic behavior in target
systems. The strange attractor is an object in state space, which
isn&rsquo;t the same as saying that the actual system behaves as if
there&rsquo;s a strange attractor in the physical space of its
activity. A trajectory in state space provides useful information
about the target system (via the faithful model assumption). The
presence of a strange attractor would only be a potential mark of
chaos, not an explanation for why chaotic properties emerged.</p>

<p>
At this point, a question implied at the end of the previous
subsection arises: What&rsquo;s effecting the unification in chaos
explanations? Unification accounts typically posit an explanatory
store of a relatively small number of laws or mechanisms serving to
explain or unify a diverse set of phenomena. A standard example is
that of Newtonian mechanics providing a small set of principles
explaining phenomena as diverse as projectile motions, falling bodies,
tides, planetary orbits, and pendula. If a unification construal of
chaos explanations only focuses on the mathematical similarities in
behaviors of diverse phenomena (e.g., period doubling route to chaos
or SDIC), then one can question whether the relevant sense of
unification is in play in chaos explanations. If unification is
supposed to be achieved through underlying mechanisms producing these
mathematical and geometrical features, then the explanatory store
appears to be very large and heterogeneous&mdash;the mechanisms in
physics are different from those in biology, are different from those
in ecology, are different from those in social psychology. In this
light, the causal-mechanical model appears to make more sense for
characterizing the nature of chaos explanations.</p>

<h4><a name="ChaUnd">5.2.2 Chaos and Understanding</a></h4>

<p>
In contrast to causal explanation, Kellert argues what&rsquo;s new
about chaos explanations is qualitative understanding. He argues this
is achieved by constructing, elaborating, and applying simple
dynamical models (1993, ch. 4). Kellert gives three points of contrast
between qualitative understanding and what he takes to be the standard
approach to scientific explanation. First, chaos explanations involve
holistic rather than microreductionist models seeking to break systems
down into constituent parts looking for law-like relations among them.
In contrast, mathematical tools of chaotic dynamics are holistic
yielding information about the behavior of the model system as a whole
not readily apparent from the nonlinear equations of the model
themselves. Second, he argues deductive explanatory schemes are
irrelevant because chaos studies appeal to computer simulations due to
the difficulty or even impossibility of deducing chaotic behavior of a
system from the model equations (e.g., no proof of SD for the Lorenz
model equations). Third, when linear superposition fails, full
specification of an instantaneous state of the system plus the
equations of motion doesn&rsquo;t yield all needed information, for
example, if there are memory effects (hysteresis), or measurement acts
introducing disturbances that SDIC can amplify. Chaos explanations
must take model histories as well as a model for the uncertainty into
account.</p>

<p>
Kellert argues the understanding achieved in chaos explanations
involves (1) predictions of qualitative behavior rather than
quantitative detail, (2) geometric mechanisms rather than causal
processes, and (3) patterns rather than law-like necessity.</p>

<p>
Support for (1) comes from Kellert focusing on the practices of
scientists predicting when qualitative features of the nonlinear
dynamics undergo sudden changes (e.g., control parameter
 values<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 at which various bifurcations occur, the onset of chaos, the return
of periodic orbits) rather than studying the precise values of system
variables. Yet, rather precise predictions can be made for chaotic
models such as the logistic map. Kellert underestimates the
quantitative detail mathematicians and scientists study in these
models.</p>

<p>
Kellert is on safer ground arguing for (2), where the kinds of
mechanisms on which chaos explanations focus aren&rsquo;t causal, but
geometric. As Koperski (2001) points out, trajectories on strange
attractors &ldquo;can only move through state [space] points that are
&rsquo;already there&rsquo;&rdquo; in the sense that the possibilities
for states are already described by the state space and its related
evolution equations; strange attractors add nothing that isn&rsquo;t
already present in the possibilities encompassed by the evolution
equations (p. 698).</p>

<p>
Regarding (3), chaos studies do study patterns rather than proposing
revisions to physical laws as relativity and QM did. The focus is on
techniques for analysis at the length scale of wholes where
interesting phenomenological regularities exist which cannot be probed
by microreductionist approaches. But at first blush, this may not
count against the microreductionist in anything other than an
epistemological sense
 (<a href="#ChaEmerg">&sect;6.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Kellert, contrasts dynamical understanding focused on causal
explanation through full nonlinear models with chaos explanations
pursuing understanding using reduced equations derived through various
techniques, though still based on the full nonlinear equations. This
contrast suggests there&rsquo;s a kind of unification going on in
chaos explanation after all: A set of patterns serves as the
explanatory or unificatory features uniting qualitative understanding
across a very diverse set of phenomena and
 disciplines.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 In turn, this suggests a further possibility: A causal account of
explanation is more appropriate when focusing on the full model, while
a unification account of phenomenology and patterns is more
appropriate when focusing on the reduced chaotic model. In the latter
case, understanding is achieved not because the model trajectories are
isomorphic to the system trajectories; rather, because there&rsquo;s a
topological or geometric similarity between the models and systems
being modeled. This is a different version of the faithful model
assumption in that now the topological/geometric features of target
systems are taken to be faithfully represented by our chaotic
models.</p>

<h3><a name="QueTakSto">5.3 Taking Stock</a></h3>

<p>
Kellert&rsquo;s discussion of &ldquo;dynamic understanding&rdquo;
highlights that various robust or universal features of chaos are
important for chaos studies. Focusing on universal features, such as
patterns, critical parameter values, and so forth, suggest some form
of unification could be at work in chaos explanations: group together
all examples of chaotic behavior via universal patterns and other
features.</p>

<p>
Kellert argues we understand how chaos arises when we can point to a
period doubling sequence or to the presence of a strange attractor,
for instance. But this only provides distinguishing marks for chaos
rather than yielding genuine insight into what causes the behavior. he
eschews causes regarding chaos explanations and there&rsquo;s a fairly
straightforward reason for this: Simplified mathematical models, such
as the baker&rsquo;s map or derived from Poincar&eacute; surface of
section techniques, make no references to causes. Hence, whether
causal, unificationist, or some other approach to scientific
explanation best capture chaos research remains open.</p>

<p>
Moreover, since all these simplified models use the same mathematics,
is it surprising to see the same patterns arise over and over again in
disparate models? After all, if all the traces of processes and
interactions&mdash;the causes&mdash;have been removed from chaos
models, as Kellert suggests, chaos models in physics, biology,
economics, and social psychology should exhibit similar behavior. If
it really boils down to the same mathematics in all the models, then
what are we actually coming to understand? On the other hand, perhaps
chaos studies are uncovering universal patterns in the actual world,
not just in mathematics. Identifying and describing these universal
patterns with similar mathematics is one thing; explaining them is
another. This challenge, too, is similar for understanding the role of
universality classes in explanations in condensed matter physics and
quantum field theory.</p>

<h2><a name="SomBroImpCha">6. Some Broader Implications of Chaos</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ChaDet">6.1 Chaos and Determinism</a></h3>

<p>
Mathematically, chaos is a property of dynamical systems which are
deterministic
 (<a href="#DynSysDet">&sect;1.1.1</a>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>,
 yet some think chaos reflects a form of indeterminism. Chaotic
systems are notorious for unpredictability, and some, such as Karl
Popper (1950), have argued unpredictability implies indeterminism.
Yet, this identifies determinism (an ontological property) with
predictability (an epistemic property).</p>

<p>
Physicist turned Anglican priest John Polkinghorne drew on critical
realism to argue that SDIC creates an ontological openness of complex
dynamical systems to influences not fully accounted for in physics
descriptions leading to a failure of determinism (1989). Physicist
Boris Chirikov, of Chirikov standard map fame, claims chaos &ldquo;has
destroyed the deterministic image of &hellip; classical physics&rdquo; (1992,
p. 9). Nevertheless, unique evolution is preserved in our mathematical
models of chaos, the ontic descriptions of chaotic
 systems.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
What could challenge the determinism of actual-world systems? Presumed
connections between nonlinear dynamical systems and target systems are
one possibility. Mathematical modeling requires distinctions between
variables and parameters as well as between systems and boundaries.
However, without linear superposition such distinctions become
problematic as illustrated throughout this article. This situation
raises questions about our epistemic access to systems and models in
the investigation of complex systems, but also challenges inferring
determinism of target systems based on these models: For nonlinear
systems the faithful model assumption
 (<a href="#StaSpaFaiModAss">&sect;1.1.3</a>)
 raises difficulties for inferring the determinism of the target
system from the deterministic character of the model.</p>

<p>
Consider relationships between model and target system. There&rsquo;s
no general guarantee this relationship is one-to-one even for the most
faithful model. The relationship may actually be many-to-one or
many-to-many. A many-to-one relationship raises problems. For
instance, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for different modeling groups to
develop models for the same project, with some being deterministic
models while others are nondeterministic models.</p>

<p>
Perhaps determinism is context-dependent as illustrated by the stark
differences between the character of the macroscopic and microscopic
realms. The physics of the macroscopic is filled with material systems
well-described by deterministic models. Meanwhile, QM is filled with
material systems well-described by indeterministic models. The
algebras of observables and related state spaces of macroscopic and
microscopic systems are different representing distinct kinds of
contexts. Furthermore, there are reasons to think that even in the
macroscopic realm conditions establishing deterministic contexts may
not always hold (e.g., Bishop 2024; Earman 1986; Jones 1990; Koperski
2020). For instance, there are conditions under which unique evolution
fails in Newtonian gravity (e.g., Xia 1992).</p>

<p>
Determinism as context dependent implies that if determinism is a
necessary condition for chaos in mathematical models, then we would
expect it to be a necessary condition for chaotic dynamics in
actual-world systems, returning us to our realism discussion.</p>

<h3><a id="ChaEmerg">6.2 Chaos and Emergence</a></h3>

<p>
Relating quantum and classical domains is more nuanced than usually
appreciated. While this relationship, along with philosophy of mind,
is classic territory for emergence debates (e.g., Bedau and Humphreys
2008; Gibb, Hendry, and Lancaster 2019), chaos exhibits marks of
emergence. For instance, it isn&rsquo;t found in QM but arises in
macroscopic/classical systems with algebras of observables and state
spaces distinct from those of QM.</p>

<p>
The Born-Oppenheimer procedure in quantum chemistry illustrates how
chaos only appears for appropriate classical observables and state
spaces
 (<a href="quantum-chaos.html">Supplement: Quantum Chaos</a>,
 &sect;Q3.1). The quantum-to-classical transition is singular
requiring physical stability conditions such as large disparity
between nuclear and electron masses and motions as well as three
spatial dimensions, among others. Even in semi-classical mechanics,
classical signatures of chaos only emerge if classical state spaces
and observables arise.</p>

<p>
Tunneling provides another example
 (<a href="quantum-chaos.html">Supplement: Quantum Chaos</a>,
 &sect;Q3.2). Similar to how chaos in classical billiards constrains
the possible behaviors of quantum billiards models, chaos and the
structure of the corresponding classical state spaces constrain
tunneling behavior in corresponding quantum models, an unexpected
relationship based on typical textbook presentations of QM and the
correspondence principle.</p>

<p>
Some marks of classical chaos can be found in Bohmian mechanics
 (<a href="quantum-chaos.html">Supplement: Quantum Chaos</a>,
 &sect;Q3). Yet even here, marks of emergence are found in the
quantum/classical algebra of observables and mixed state space arising
from the stability condition of having trajectories with classical
position and momentum observables.</p>

<p>
Quantum chaology has a subtle, complicated relationship to classical
chaos that isn&rsquo;t captured by reductionism. Marks and tools of
quantum chaology have no direct correspondence to marks and tools of
classical chaos, nor are the latter marks and tools results of
limiting procedures from the quantum domain to the macroscopic. Even,
the replacement of classical observables by quantum operators already
entails an ontological shift in states and observables as well as in
the relevant state spaces bearing no resemblance to an approximation
relation.</p>

<p>
Then consider the phenomenon of classical chaos and its tools of
study. Lyapunov exponents, for instance, are only definable in
dynamical systems under appropriate limits and conditions
corresponding to classical state spaces and trajectories. Despite some
confusion in the quantum chaology literature, Lyapunov exponents are a
classical concept and a mathematical object definable only for
classical dynamical systems.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, chaotic dynamics only emerges under particular parameter
values for both mathematical models and actual-world systems
exhibiting unique evolution. Features such as determinism and
parameters are relevant as stability conditions for when SDIC,
aperiodicity, and other signatures of chaos emerge from regular system
behavior.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s often the case that the only ontological form of emergence
contrasted with reductionism is so-called strong or radical emergence,
where brute inexplicable bridge laws or causal powers come into
existence with no connection to any other properties, laws, or
activities at other temporal and length scales (e.g., Broad 1925;
Hendry 2019; Symons
 2018).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 However, such emergence accounts yield a disunified world with
radically emergent properties and entities. Chaos isn&rsquo;t a
disconnected phenomenon along these radical lines.</p>

<p>
Alternative ontological accounts of emergence rooted in the sciences
and scientific practice offer frameworks for situating chaotic
dynamics in a unified understanding. For instance, transformational
emergence emphasizes dynamical transformations, where smaller-scale
properties and constituents disappear in the formation of new
larger-scale properties or entities, or emergent wholes transform the
dynamics and properties of smaller-scale properties or entities
(Humphreys 2016; Santos 2015 and 2020). Contextual emergence
emphasizes multi-scale relations and the roles of stability conditions
not given at smaller length and shorter time scales that nevertheless
constrain or enable properties, entities, and processes at these
smaller/shorter scales, making modal changes to possibility and
actualization at these latter scales (Bishop, Silberstein, and Pexton
2022). Such ontological accounts capture the emergent phenomena of
chaos in intelligible ways exhibiting order and unity.</p>

<h3><a id="LawCause">6.3 Chaos, Laws, and Causation</a></h3>

<p>
Kellert&rsquo;s line on explanation
 (<a href="#NatChaExp">&sect;5.2</a>)
 questions the relevance of laws and causation for chaotic dynamics.
Chaos exhibits an exquisite order and since the 17th century
 <a href="../laws-of-nature/">laws of nature</a>
 have been conceived of as the source of order in the universe. The
two main traditions for analyzing laws of nature are: (1) nomological
realist accounts, where laws have metaphysical existence and enforce
patterns and regularities on properties and processes in nature; and
(2) regularity accounts, where patterns and relations observed in
nature exist with no additional necessity or metaphysical glue needed
to enforce or sustain them.</p>

<p>
Nomological realist accounts often invoke a form of necessity or
&ldquo;governance.&rdquo; Chaos challenges these intuitions. For
instance, one might argue that equations of a system govern its
behavior, but as we&rsquo;ve seen equations simpliciter don&rsquo;t
fulfil this expectation. Chaotic behavior is sensitive to particular
parameter values and, within this context, SDIC. Nevertheless,
parameter values don&rsquo;t govern behavior any more than the value
of \(\pi\) governs the circumference of a circle. One might argue the
stretching and folding properties of dynamics underlying chaos are
reflections of dynamical laws governing systems. This leads to
concluding there are no genuine chaos laws; instead, chaos results
from interaction among various dynamical laws subject to specific
parameter values.</p>

<p>
Regularity accounts differ based on how they cash out the nature of
which regularities count as laws, such as best systems or
supervenience approaches. There&rsquo;s some form of determination
going on in chaotic dynamics. For instance, chaos exhibited in
classical models plays some determining role in the behavior of the
corresponding quantum models, such as modifying tunneling rates.
However, the determination relation runs in the opposite direction of
the supervenience intuition in these cases from the larger-scale
classical phenomena to the micro-scale quantum phenomena.</p>

<p>
Dynamical laws have been an important class of scientific laws in both
traditions. Such laws are often conceived as either governing or
describing the history of state transitions a system makes given some
initial and boundary conditions. Nonlinear dynamics and chaos
won&rsquo;t settle debates among adherents to these two traditions.
Nonetheless, chaotic dynamics, its properties, and practices
associated with its study may suggest an alternative approach to
understanding the regularities in question.</p>

<p>
Consider Newton&rsquo;s second law, \(F=ma\) , where \(F\) is a model
for the force acting on a particle, \(a\) the acceleration or rate of
change of the particle&rsquo;s velocity, and \(m\) the
particle&rsquo;s mass. Instead of thinking of the force as
&ldquo;governing&rdquo; the particle&rsquo;s behavior, or of the
particle&rsquo;s behavior as supervening on the force, the modeling of
forces and system states in physics typically is carried out in terms
of energy, constraints and affordances. Such models are defined over
state spaces delimiting the range of possibilities for the system.
Newton&rsquo;s law constrains the action of forces along with other
constraints and affordances (e.g., Koperski 2020, pp. 101&ndash;104,
134, 155&ndash;156; Bishop, Silberstein, and Pexton 2022, sec. 7.8;
Adlam, E. 2022). These factors are physical, dimensional (e.g., many
forces behave differently in two dimensions versus three), dynamical
(e.g., due to system dynamics arising over time), and so forth. These
different stability conditions define the particulars of a physical
context for system behaviors. In fluid convection, for instance,
emergent large-scale fluid rotation constrains possible motions of
smaller-scale fluid molecules under the action of gravity (Bishop
2024).</p>

<p>
In short, physical laws, such as the two-way speed of light in vacuum,
may delineate bounds of possibility; they don&rsquo;t determine
concrete actualization of any of those delineated possibilities. More
features of actual-world contexts are needed for particular
actualizations.</p>

<p>
Chaotic dynamics behaves as stability conditions while also being
shaped by laws and other features of context. For example, parameter
values can prevent chaos from arising, but for parameter values
enabling chaos, chaotic dynamics constrains system constituents from
behaving regularly in particular regions of state space. These
situations involve lawlike relations structuring possibility spaces
while parameter values determine when possibilities for irregular
motion arise. None of the laws relevant for the systems in question
determine parameter values; rather, parameter values function as
stability conditions for the existence/nonexistence of chaos within
the space of possibility. Moreover, tunneling and other behaviors in
quantum models are modified by the corresponding classical chaotic
dynamics.</p>

<p>
Similarly for causation. One can offer
 <a href="../causation-counterfactual/">counterfactual analyses</a>
 of system behavior, based on presence or absence of chaotic dynamics.
Or one can offer process accounts of causation (e.g., Dowe 2000;
Salmon 1984), focusing on chaotic processes. Or one could offer
 <a href="../causation-counterfactual/">probabilistic accounts</a>
 for how various factors raise the probability for a system to exhibit
chaotic behavior or for the presence of chaos to raise or lower the
chances of an expected outcome. And so forth. Each account has
something to recommend it in particular circumstances and some may
combine in contexts to yield more insight.</p>

<p>
Perhaps Kellert&rsquo;s form of understanding
 (<a href="#ChaUnd">&sect;5.2.2</a>)
 can be related to how affordance and constraint function in the
possibilities offered by state spaces and actual-world systems. For
instance, trajectories caught in a strange attractor in state space
are constrained to remain on the attractor and can no longer exhibit
regular behavior. These possibilities have been excluded, while the
possibilities for a wide variety of irregular behavior are now
accessible. For trajectories away from the strange attractor,
irregular behavior is impossible yet a variety of regular behavior is
available. The faithful model assumption is needed to transfer these
insights from constraint and affordance in models to their
actual-world counterparts. Nevertheless, physical models, such as
damped driven pendulums, are able to exhibit chaotic motion so long as
parameters remain in value ranges enabling chaotic but closing off
regular motion. Reduction/emergence issues are relevant here as
well.</p>

<h3><a name="FreWilCon">6.4 Consciousness and Free Will</a></h3>

<p>
Several authors have looked to QM to help explain consciousness and
free will (e.g., Beck and Eccles 1992; Compton 1935; Eccles 1970; Kane
1996; Penrose 1991, 1994 and 1997; Stapp 1993;
 <a href="../qt-consciousness/">quantum consciousness</a>).
 Interplay between SDIC in macroscopic systems and quantum effects
provide opportunities for quantum effects to influence such systems
(see
 <a href="#ChaDetQuaMec">&sect;4</a>).
 SD arguments purport to demonstrate that chaos in classical systems
can amplify quantum fluctuations. Suppose chaotic dynamics could
amplify quantum events causing a single neuron to fire that
wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise. If the brain is also in a chaotic dynamical
state, making it sensitive to small disturbances, this additional
neural firing could be amplified causing brain states to evolve
differently than if the neuron hadn&rsquo;t fired affecting human
choices.</p>

<p>
While the presence of chaos in the brain and its operations is an
empirical matter that&rsquo;s hotly debated, these discussions
typically assume SD or Chaos\(_{\lambda}\) as the definition of chaos.
All that&rsquo;s really needed for sensitivity to and amplification of
quantum effects in the brain is the loss of superposition found in
nonlinear systems. Yet, these kinds of sensitivity arguments depend on
how QM and measurements are interpreted as well as the status of
indeterminism
 (<a href="#ChaDetQuaMec">&sect;4</a>).
 Furthermore, applying SD arguments to concrete physical systems
indicates amplification processes may be severely constrained. In the
case of the brain, we currently don&rsquo;t know all the constraints
on amplification, but large amounts of parallel redundancy in brain
regions and neural networks make changes in one neuron&rsquo;s firing
unlikely to be amplified to any appreciable degree affecting neural
dynamics.</p>

<p>
Whether such approaches to understanding the nature of consciousness
and free will represent genuine advances remains an open question. For
instance, if the world is deterministic, then the invocation of SDIC
in cognitive dynamics (e.g., Kane 1996) may provide a sophisticated
framework for exploring deliberative processes, but wouldn&rsquo;t be
sufficient for incompatibilist notions of freedom. If indeterminism
(quantum mechanical or otherwise) is operative in the brain, the
challenge remains for indeterminists, such Robert Kane (1996), to
demonstrate agents can effectively harness such indeterminism by
utilizing the exquisite sensitivity provided by nonlinear dynamics to
explain free will. Questions about realism and explanation in chaotic
dynamics are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption
and emergence.</p>

<p>
There has also been relevant work applying the perspective of
dynamical systems to cognition and action, drawing explicitly on such
properties as attractors, bifurcations, SDIC, and other denizens of
the chaos zoo (e.g., van Gelder 1995; Juarrero 1999 and 2023; Kelso
1995; Port and van Gelder 1995; Tsuda 2001). The basic idea is
deploying the nonlinear dynamics framework for interpreting neural and
cognitive activity as well as complex behavior. The aim is that
patterns of neural, cognitive, and human activity can be explained as
resulting from nonlinear dynamical processes involving causal
interactions, constraints, and affordances at multiple length and time
scales (e.g., neurons, brains, bodies, physical environments). Such
approaches are highly suggestive, but also face challenges. For
instance, the nature of neural and cognitive dynamics is still much
disputed. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s an empirical matter whether these
dynamics are largely nonlinear though more evidence has been gathered
in recent decades suggesting the appropriate nonlinearity (e.g.,
Anderson 2010; Chemero and Silberstein 2008; Stam 2006; Pesenson 2013;
Shettigar et al. 2022; Juarrero 2023). Again, questions about realism
and explanation in chaotic dynamics are relevant here as well as the
faithful model assumption and emergence.</p>
