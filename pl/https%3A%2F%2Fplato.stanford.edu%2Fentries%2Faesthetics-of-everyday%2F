<h1>Aesthetics of the Everyday</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Sep 30, 2015; substantive revision Sat Nov 29, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In the history of Western aesthetics, the subject matters that
received attention ranged from natural objects and phenomena, built
structures, utilitarian objects, and human actions, to what is today
regarded as the fine arts. However, beginning with the nineteenth
century, the discourse has become increasingly focused on the fine
arts. This narrowing attention occurred despite the prominence of the
aesthetic attitude theory in modern aesthetics, according to which
there is virtually no limit to what can become a source of aesthetic
experience. The tendency to equate aesthetics with the philosophy of
art became widespread in twentieth century aesthetics, particularly
within the Anglo-American tradition.</p>

<p>
Challenges to this rather limited scope of aesthetics began during the
latter half of the twentieth century with a renewed interest in nature
and environment, followed by the exploration of popular arts. Everyday
aesthetics continues this trajectory of widening scope by including
objects, events, and activities that constitute people&rsquo;s daily
life. However, it is more accurate to characterize this recent
development as <em>restoring</em> the scope of aesthetics rather than
opening a new arena.</p>

<p>
In addition, many cultural traditions outside the Western sphere have
long been concerned with the aesthetics of daily life. In some
cultural traditions, such as Inuit and Navajo, aesthetic
considerations are thoroughly integrated in daily activities,
including making things such as tools (Papanek 1995; Witherspoon
1996). Even in other traditions, such as Japanese and Chinese, with
distinctive art-making practices of paintings, literature, theater,
and the like, aesthetic practices permeate people&rsquo;s daily life.
One of the findings of comparative aesthetics is that a greater
emphasis is placed on the aesthetics of everyday life in many
non-Western cultures than in the West (Higgins 2005).</p>

<p>
Thus, the perception that everyday aesthetics is a new frontier of
aesthetics discourse needs to be situated in the context of late
twentieth-century Anglo-American aesthetics. That is, it was
established as a reaction against what was considered to be an undue
restriction on the scope of aesthetics. It aims to give due regard to
the entirety of people&rsquo;s multi-faceted aesthetic life, including
various ingredients of everyday life: artifacts of daily use, chores
around the house, interactions with other people, and quotidian
activities such as eating, walking, and bathing. Everyday aesthetics
also seeks to liberate aesthetic inquiry from an almost exclusive
focus on beauty (and to a certain extent sublimity) characteristic of
modern Western aesthetics. It includes within its purview those
qualities that pervade everyday experience, such as pretty, cute,
messy, gaudy, tasteful, dirty, lively, monotonous, repugnant,
disgusting, and many others. In addition to illuminating the aesthetic
dimensions, both positive and negative, of those things which have
been neglected in the aesthetics discourse as well as in popular
imagination, everyday aesthetics pursues their moral, social,
political, and environmental consequences in people&rsquo;s everyday
life. This exploration shows that seemingly trivial aesthetic tastes,
preferences, and judgments regarding everyday life can play a
significant role in determining the quality of life and the state of
the world.</p>

<p>
Everyday aesthetics also raises theoretical issues that have not
received adequate attention from the prevailing mainstream Western
aesthetics. These include: indeterminate identity of the object of
aesthetic experience due to a lack of an institutionally agreed-upon
framing; changes and modifications everyday objects go through;
general anonymity of the designer and creator, as well as absence of
any clear authorship behind everyday objects; bodily engagements with
objects and activities and their practical outcome; perceived lack of
criteria for aesthetic judgments. By raising these issues, everyday
aesthetics challenges long-held assumptions underlying art-centered
aesthetics discourse. However, everyday aesthetics advocates pose
these challenges not as a way of invalidating the established
aesthetics discourse. Rather, they are meant to shed new light on the
prevailing discourse. Just as new forms of art often introduce
qualities and values that were not considered before and enrich the
art world, as suggested by Arthur Danto, everyday aesthetics proposes
to help develop the overall aesthetics discourse by adding new avenues
of inquiry. Accordingly, the account of everyday aesthetics that
follows will focus on these issues that have been raised to illuminate
and challenge the prevailing aesthetics discourse in contemporary
Western philosophy.</p>

<h2><a id="RecHis">1. Recent History</a></h2>

<p>
With the establishment of environmental aesthetics, efforts to open
the field of aesthetics beyond the fine arts started during the latter
half of twentieth century. Almost all writers on everyday aesthetics
derive inspiration from John Dewey&rsquo;s <em>Art as Experience</em>,
first published in 1934. In particular, his discussion of
&ldquo;having <em>an</em> experience&rdquo; demonstrates that
aesthetic experience is possible in every aspect of people&rsquo;s
daily life, ranging from eating a meal or solving a math problem to
having a job interview. By locating &lsquo;the aesthetic&rsquo; in the
character of an experience rather than in a specific kind of object or
situation, Dewey paves the way for everyday aesthetics advocates to
explore diverse aspects of people&rsquo;s aesthetic lives without a
pre-configured boundary.</p>

<p>
If Dewey&rsquo;s aesthetics can be considered as the classic for
everyday aesthetics discourse, Arnold Berleant&rsquo;s early works on
aesthetic field and engagement continue the trajectory. Despite
focusing on the experience of art and without specifically referring
to the term &lsquo;everyday aesthetics,&rsquo; Berleant&rsquo;s early
works provide a phenomenological account of aesthetic experience by
denying a separation between the object of experience and the
experiencing subject, while instead focusing on their relationship and
emphasizing the collaborative process as engagement (Berleant 1970,
1991). This notion of &lsquo;engagement&rsquo; as a model for
aesthetics is applicable to one&rsquo;s experience beyond art. Indeed,
his subsequent works on environmental aesthetics, both natural and
built, and more recently on social aesthetics and negative aesthetics,
have been steadily broadening the scope of aesthetic inquiry and
restoring the rightful role aesthetic engagement plays with the world
and in human lives.</p>

<p>
Besides works on environmental aesthetics that addresses built
environments (see the entry on
 <a href="../environmental-aesthetics/">environmental aesthetics</a>),
 other notable early works specifically addressing issues of everyday
aesthetics include Melvin Rader and Bertram Jessup&rsquo;s <em>Art and
Human Values</em> (1976), Joseph Kupfer&rsquo;s <em>Experience as Art:
Aesthetics in Everyday Life</em> (1983), David Novitz&rsquo;s <em>The
Boundaries of Art: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Place of Art in
Everyday Life</em> (1992), Thomas Leddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Everyday
Surface Aesthetic Qualities: &lsquo;Neat,&rsquo; &lsquo;Messy,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Clean,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dirty&rsquo;&rdquo; (1995) and
&ldquo;Sparkle and Shine&rdquo; (1997), Crispin Sartwell&rsquo;s
<em>The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual
Traditions</em> (1995) and &ldquo;Aesthetics of the Everyday&rdquo;
(2003), Wolfgang Welsch&rsquo;s <em>Undoing Aesthetics</em> (1997),
Ossi Naukkarinen&rsquo;s <em>Aesthetics of the Unavoidable: Aesthetic
Variations in Human Appearance</em> (1999), and Marcia Eaton&rsquo;s
<em>Aesthetics and the Good Life</em> (1989) and <em>Merit, Aesthetic
and Ethical</em> (2001).</p>

<p>
The first anthology on this topic, <em>The Aesthetics of Everyday
Life</em>, edited by Andrew Light and Jonathan M. Smith, published in
2005, includes many articles that together lay the groundwork for more
recent literature on everyday aesthetics. Often cited among them are
Arto Haapala&rsquo;s &ldquo;On the Aesthetics of the Everyday:
Familiarity, Strangeness, and the Meaning of Place&rdquo; and Tom
Leddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Nature of Everyday Aesthetics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The first monograph with the specific title <em>Everyday
Aesthetics</em>, accompanied by the subtitle <em>Prosaics, the Play of
Culture and Social Identities</em>, was written by Katya Mandoki and
published in 2007. She offers an extensive critique of the prevailing
Western aesthetics discourse burdened by what she characterizes as
&ldquo;fetishes&rdquo; regarding art and beauty, as well as a detailed
semiotic analysis of aesthetics involved in areas ranging from
religion and education to family and medicine. Almost immediately
after the publication of Mandoki&rsquo;s book, Yuriko Saito&rsquo;s
<em>Everyday Aesthetics</em> was published. These works were followed
by Thomas Leddy&rsquo;s <em>The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The
Aesthetics of Everyday Life</em> (2012). They together secured the
initial foothold for the subsequent development of everyday
aesthetics.</p>

<p>
Paralleling these early works are monographs and anthologies dedicated
to specific aspects of daily life, such as gustatory aesthetics
(Korsmeyer 1999, 2005; Perullo 2016; van der Meulen and Wiese 2017),
domestic aesthetics (McCracken 2001), body aesthetics (Shusterman
1999, 2013; Bhatt 2013; Irvin 2016), functional beauty (Parsons and
Carlson 2008), the aesthetics of design (Forsey 2013), and olfactory
aesthetics (Drobnick 2005; Shiner 2020), as well as a collection of
essays dealing with the notion of &ldquo;artification&rdquo; in
practices ranging from business and education to science and sports
(Naukkarinen and Saito, 2012).</p>

<p>
All of these works together have given rise to an increasingly lively
debate on the subject in journals such as <em>Aesthetic
Investigations</em>, <em>Aisthesis</em>, <em>The British Journal of
Aesthetics</em>, <em>Contemporary Aesthetics</em>, <em>Espes</em>,
<em>The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</em>, <em>The Nordic
Journal of Aesthetics</em>, <em>Popular Inquiry</em>, <em>Proceedings
of the European Society for Aesthetics</em>, and Studi di Estetica
(<em>Italian Journal of Aesthetics</em>), to name only a few that
feature or include articles in English. In addition, more anthologies
on everyday aesthetics have subsequently been published, namely the
<em>Aisthesis</em> volume dedicated to the subject of Everyday Objects
(2014), <em>Experiencing the Everyday</em> (Friberg and Vasquez 2017),
<em>Paths from the Philosophy of Art to Everyday Aesthetics</em>
(Kuisma, et al. 2019), <em>Applying Aesthetics to Everyday Life:
Methodologies, History and New Directions</em> (Giombini and
Kvoka&#269;ka 2023), the <em>Aesthetic Investigations</em> Special
Volume on the aesthetic significance of the everyday (2024), the
<em>Contemporary Aesthetics</em> Special Volume on Atmospheric Design
and Everyday Aesthetics (2024), and <em>Anuario Filos&oacute;fico</em>
dedicated on the question, &ldquo;What is Everyday Aesthetics?&rdquo; (2025).
These anthologies and journals are particularly helpful to those
Anglophone readers who lack the language facility to access many
European aestheticians&rsquo; works, some monographs, that are written
in their own languages. Among them are Elisabetta di Stefano, Lisa
Giombini, Gioia Iannilli, Adri&aacute;n Kvoka&#269;ka, Giovanni
Matteucci, Dan Eugen Ratiu, Max Ryyn&auml;nen, and Zolt&aacute;n
Somhegyi, to list only a few. Their English language articles included
in these anthologies and journals are valuable in making their
important works available to Anglophone readers.</p>

<p>
In addition, spearheaded by Elisabetta di Stefano of the University of
Palermo, a number of aestheticians from several European countries
formed a consortium in 2022, Evanetwork [see Other Internet Resources],
 which is dedicated to exploring everyday aesthetics. Its activity
includes hosting international conferences in different institutions
of its members, often followed by the publication of anthologies
comprised of the conference papers.</p>

<p>
As was the case with her <em>Everyday Aesthetics</em>, Saito&rsquo;s
subsequent monographs, <em>Aesthetics of the Familiar: Everyday Life
and World-Making</em> (2017) and <em>Aesthetics of Care: Practice in
Everyday Life</em> (2022) include extensive discussion of Japanese
aesthetics. However, the first explicitly and specifically
multi-cultural exploration of everyday aesthetics appeared in the form
of an anthology, <em>Aesthetics of Everyday Life: East and West</em>
(2014), edited by Liu Yuedi and Curtis Carter, with a number of pieces
on Chinese aesthetics. This is followed by <em>Comparative Everyday
Aesthetics: East-West Studies in Contemporary Living</em>, edited by
Eva Kit Wah Man and Jeffrey Petts (2023). Similar to the case of
European languages, most Anglophone readers lack the language ability
to access many works on Chinese aesthetics written in Chinese. English
language papers included in these anthologies and other journal
articles by scholars provide a good entry into a rich legacy of living
aesthetics in the Chinese tradition that is garnering a renewed
attention today. Finally, although not specifically dedicated to
everyday aesthetics, many essays collected in the Special Volume 3 of
<em>Contemporary Aesthetics</em> (2011) on Aesthetics and the Arts of
Southeast Asia, the same journal&rsquo;s Special Volume 6 (2018) on
Aesthetic Consciousness in East Asia, and <em>Artistic Visions and the
Promise of Beauty: Cross Cultural Perspectives</em> (Higgins, et al
2017) provide valuable resources for non-Western aesthetics.</p>

<h2><a id="EveAesEveAes">2. &lsquo;Everyday&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aesthetics&rsquo; in Everyday Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
Because everyday aesthetics was initially proposed as a way to expand
what counts as people&rsquo;s aesthetic life beyond the limitations
imposed by modern philosophical aesthetics, its scope has not been
clearly defined except as including what has not been covered by
art-centered aesthetics. With the development of this discourse,
however, questions emerged as to what constitutes
&lsquo;everyday&rsquo; and &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; in everyday
aesthetics. Inclusion of not only daily activities like eating,
grooming, dressing, and cleaning but also occasional and even rare
events such as parties, sporting events, holidays, weddings, and
travelling calls into question whether &lsquo;everyday&rsquo; should
be understood literally.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, what may count as an everyday activity for one person may
be a special occasion for other people. Working on a farm constitutes
a farmer&rsquo;s everyday life, while it is a rare experience sought
by a city dweller who participates in a tour that incorporates work
experience, such as a day working in a vineyard. Besides
people&rsquo;s occupation and lifestyle, diverse living environments
determine what is included in their everyday life. For those residents
in a densely populated urban area with a developed network of public
transportation, as well as for those living in different parts of the
world, riding in a car may be a rare occasion, while it is a daily
routine for many living in typical American suburbs. Some
people&rsquo;s daily lives consist of constant travels, as in the case
of a famed conductor, Valery Gergiev (Puolakka 2019). Finally,
cultural traditions and practices complicate the matter even more, as
well as the life circumstances of individuals which are characterized
as precarious, an issue discussed further in Section 10 (Berleant
2023b; Enroth 2021).</p>

<p>
The notion of &lsquo;everyday&rsquo; thus becomes hopelessly unwieldy,
and it is impossible to come up with a list of objects and activities
that belong to it. However, one could point to some core activities
and objects that transcend individual and cultural differences, such
as eating, dressing, grooming, shelter, and basic utilitarian objects,
such as clothing, furniture, and eating implements (Melchionne 2013).
The most important factor for the purpose of everyday aesthetics,
however, is not so much an inventory of objects and activities but
rather the typical attitude we take toward them. We tend to experience
these objects and activities mostly with practical considerations that
eclipse their aesthetic potentials (Bullough 1912&ndash;13; Stolnitz
1969; Ziff 1997). These experiences are generally regarded as
ordinary, commonplace, and routine. Such characterization may be the
best way to capture &lsquo;everyday,&rsquo; allowing diverse
occupations, lifestyles, and living environments that give rise to
different ingredients of everyday life.</p>

<p>
Many advocates of everyday aesthetics, however, also include rare,
stand out, and more artistically-charged occasions in its scope. For
example, a holiday celebration is laden with all kinds of aesthetic
considerations, ranging from interior and exterior decorations to
special dishes, a carefully-arranged table setting and festive music.
Many of us specifically attend to these aesthetic aspects both as
providers and as receivers, giving aesthetic considerations a
prominent role in these experiences. In light of these different kinds
of experiences, some suggest allowing gradation among various objects
and activities, with one end designating the most quotidian objects
and activities that are experienced primarily with a practical
mindset, and the other end those occasions standing out from daily
life and marked by much more conscious attention to the aesthetic
dimension, rendering the experience more like art appreciation
(Naukkarinen 2013; Leddy 2015).</p>

<p>
Thus, recent discussion of the notion of everyday emphasizes
relationality and lability, a temporary framework that responds to
specific time and place, whether it regards the course of an
individual&rsquo;s life (such as a painting becoming a part of
one&rsquo;s everyday life after being purchased and hung on the living
room wall), or a general societal change, such as the increasing
presence of the digital world today. Accordingly, the distinction
between ordinary/extraordinary, familiar/unfamiliar, and
event-like/routine-like that dominate the discussion of everyday
should not be understood as something stationary, static, and fixed
(Haapala 2017; Potgieter 2017).</p>

<p>
Debates surrounding what constitutes &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; in
everyday aesthetics are not unique to this discourse. The nature of
aesthetics has been a perennial point of contention in aesthetics at
large, whether regarding fine arts, nature, popular culture or
everyday objects and activities (see in particular the entries on
 <a href="../aesthetic-concept/">The Concept of the Aesthetic</a>
 and
 <a href="../dewey-aesthetics/">Dewey&rsquo;s Aesthetics</a>).
 Many advocates of everyday aesthetics urge returning to the root
meaning of &lsquo;aesthetic&rsquo; as sensory perception gained with
sensibility and imagination. In doing so, they emphasize two points
for particular attention. First is the status of bodily sensations.
They can be felt by us as we receive sensory stimulation such as the
wafting smell of baked goods, the sensation of silk against our skin,
the taste of sushi, or the feeling of massage. They can also result
from bodily activities, such as running, chopping vegetables, using
tools, or mowing the lawn. The debate regarding whether or not these
bodily sensations belong to the realm of aesthetics proper is not new.
The best-known classical treatment of this issue is Immanuel
Kant&rsquo;s distinction between the beautiful and the agreeable or
the pleasant. Many contemporary art projects call into question this
presumed distinction through the creation of olfactory art, art
happenings that include cooking and eating, and participatory art that
requires the audience&rsquo;s bodily engagement. However, the issue
becomes more acute with everyday aesthetics because our daily
experience is permeated by sensory experiences and bodily activities
(see Sections 7 and 8 for further discussion).</p>

<p>
The second point raised by everyday aesthetics regarding the term
&lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; is the distinction between its honorific and
classificatory use. In both aesthetics discourse and common
vernacular, the term &lsquo;aesthetic&rsquo; is generally used in the
honorific sense. Hence, something exhibiting an aesthetic quality is
generally regarded positively and gaining an aesthetic experience is
understood to mean that it is a meaningful and satisfying experience.
However, in our everyday lives, some things strike us with powerful
positive aesthetic values, as in a great work of art or a spectacular
landscape, while other things do not affect us much because they are
boring, non-descript, or plain. Then there are those objects and
phenomena that offend or disturb us profoundly because their sensuous
appearance is hideous, monstrous, or appalling, without any overall
redeeming value such as an artistic message. Everyday aesthetics casts
a wide net for capturing these diverse dimensions of our aesthetic
life. It is noteworthy that in academic discourses outside of analytic
philosophical aesthetics, &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; is often regarded
in the classificatory sense, such as the aesthetics of manners, which
includes both polite and rude behaviors, and the aesthetics of
politics which, among other things, refers to the social and political
construction of what counts as the sensible (Mandoki 2007;
Ranci&egrave;re 2009; Vihalem 2018).</p>

<p>
Some recent writers propose that everyday aesthetics will be better
served by characterizing the aesthetic as a specific mode of
perception. Everyday aestheticians who emphasize the difference of
everyday aesthetic experience from a typical experience of art tend to
characterize the former&rsquo;s passivity and minimize the mediation
of various conceptual considerations, emotional involvement, and
imaginative engagement typically required in experiencing art. While
it is agreed that the aesthetic experience is based upon our sensory
perception, without a more active, creative, and imaginative
involvement, those critics point out, there is nothing distinctly
aesthetic about mere sensations. One suggested solution is to
characterize an aesthetic experience as a dynamic and dialectic
process of sensory perception and reflectivity that form
<em>aisthesis</em> which leads to a dialogical relationship with the
object we are perceiving (Matteucci 2017). This more general theory of
aesthetic perception will help overcome the aforementioned two issues
everyday aestheticians were grappling with, namely inclusion of all
sensory modes and rendering the term valence-neutral. As will be
discussed later in Section 8, one of the issues everyday aesthetics
needs to determine is whether it carves out an independent arena of
aesthetics or it is rather a continuation of aesthetics discourse that
had been established with art as the primary model. Those who advocate
the continuity model argue that the dialogical mode of perception that
integrates reflectivity provides the specifically aesthetic character
to everyday experience (Nielsen 2005; Mateucci 2017; Potgieter
2017).</p>

<h2><a id="DefFam">3. Defamiliarization of the Familiar</a></h2>

<p>
If &lsquo;everyday&rsquo; is characterized as the familiar, ordinary,
commonplace, and routine, regardless of the specific content that
varies from people to people depending upon their lifestyle,
occupation, living environment, and other factors, what makes its
aesthetic appreciation possible? The following response dominates
everyday aesthetics discourse: the aesthetic appreciation of everyday
life requires defamiliarization, making strange, or casting an aura.
Because we are most of the time preoccupied by the task at hand in our
daily life, practical considerations mask the aesthetic potential of
commonplace objects and ordinary activities. Furthermore, such
experiences lack any coherent structure consisting of unity, pervasive
character, and a clear beginning and an end. In short, according to
Dewey, our everyday humdrum life proceeds mechanically without any
internal organic evolution, hence &ldquo;anesthetic.&rdquo; Only when
we have <em>an</em> experience with all the structural requirements
fulfilled does our everyday life gain aesthetic merit. Once we have
<em>an</em> experience with a different attitude and perceptual gear
and/or a cohesive internal structure, we can unearth latent aesthetic
values in the most ordinary things and routine activities. This view
can be interpreted as a faithful application of the claim made by the
aesthetic attitude theory that theoretically anything can be an object
of aesthetic experience. Mundane objects can acquire a kind of
&lsquo;aura&rsquo; that heightens their aesthetic value (Leonhardt
1985; Tuan 1993; Visser 1997; Gumbrecht 2006; Leddy 2012a; Al Qudwa
2017). According to this interpretation, what is new about everyday
aesthetics is its illumination of those aspects of our lives that are
normally neglected or ignored because they are eclipsed by stand out
aesthetic experiences we often have with works of art and nature. More
careful attention and a different mindset can reveal a surprisingly
rich aesthetic dimension of the otherwise mundane, non-memorable,
ordinary parts of our daily life. Many works of art are helpful in
guiding us through the morasses of everyday life toward a rewarding
aesthetic experience (Dillard 1974; Prose 1999; Stabb 2002; Martin
2004, Leddy 2012a, 2015; Nanay 2016, 2018). This trajectory of
everyday aesthetics is welcomed by a number of thinkers for its
contribution to enriching life experiences, encouraging mindful
living, and facilitating happiness without problematic consequences
that often accompany a hedonistic lifestyle (Irvin 2008b; Shusterman
2013; Melchionne 2014; Leddy 2014; Hughes and Berleant, Irvin,
Haapala, Al Qudwa, and Kidd in Polrum, et al 2025).</p>

<p>
At the same time, some point out the danger of over-emphasizing
defamiliarization as a precondition for everyday aesthetics. That is,
this way of accounting for everyday aesthetics risks losing the very
everyday-ness of everyday experience, thereby becoming unable to
capture the aesthetic texture of everyday life characterized by its
familiar, ordinary, and mundane quality (Felski 2002, 2009; Highmore
2004, 2011a; Haapala 2005; Saito 2017). The challenge then becomes how
to capture the very ordinary everyday-ness of everyday life while
engaging aesthetically. That is, experiencing and appreciating the
ordinary as extraordinary follows a rather well-trodden path in
aesthetics discourse, while experiencing and appreciating the ordinary
as ordinary poses a specific challenge to everyday aesthetics
discourse.</p>

<p>
Several responses have been given to account for the aesthetics of the
ordinary as ordinary. One proposed response is to regard qualities
such as the familiar and the ordinary as positively appreciable as a
counterpart to those qualities that make some experiences stand out
for being intense and extraordinary. Though not stunning or intense,
those qualities characterizing ordinary life provide a quiet calm,
comfort, stability, and security to our life experience (Haapala
2005). It is difficult to imagine how we can handle, let alone enjoy,
a constant series of extraordinary, intense experiences with no
restful period. Many aspects of domestic life instead offer comfort,
stability, and respite, in short hominess, because of the very
ordinary and repetitive nature, and such qualities are indispensable
for good life and appreciable in their own right (Highmore 2004,
2011a; Irvin 2008b; Melchionne 2014).</p>

<p>
However, this response is challenged for failing to explain what is
distinctly aesthetic about the sense of comfort and stability. The
value of these feelings, according to the critics, is rather
existentially-oriented and possibly relies on the instrumental role
they play in assuring a secure foundation for life. An alternative
solution to the dilemma proposed is to focus on the functional use of
objects of daily life that is not separate from our management and
flow of daily life or the cultural context and knowledge required for
its use. When an object functions particularly well, the pleasure we
gain is still embedded in our daily life and does not render the
experience out of gear from the flow of everyday life (Forsey
2014).</p>

<p>
This move can also be characterized as a variation of
cognitively-oriented aesthetics widely discussed in environmental
aesthetics regarding nature. Instead of natural sciences that inform
the aesthetic appreciation of nature, the suggestion is that everyday
aesthetic experience be informed by common sense knowledge about the
object&rsquo;s function, significance, and place in our lives that
provides the familiarity sought for in aesthetically experiencing the
familiar as familiar (Carlson 2014).</p>

<p>
These solutions address familiarity experienced as familiar as a
positive value whether regarding hominess or excellent functionality.
However, those who are concerned with developing the classificatory
sense of aesthetics point out that the lack of coherent structure,
slackness, monotony, and humdrum that, according to Dewey, generate
experiences that are &ldquo;anesthetic&rdquo; actually also
characterize the aesthetic texture of everyday life (Highmore 2011a;
Mollar 2014; Saito 2017). Deficiency in positive aesthetic qualities,
such as exciting intensity, coherent narrative structure, or pervasive
unifying theme, does not necessarily mean lack of aesthetic qualities.
Those aspects of our lives can still be regarded as permeated by
aesthetic qualities, though negative, such as dreariness and painful
monotony. Such negative characterization of everyday life has often
been the subject of Marxist interpretations of workers&rsquo; daily
lives and so-called reproductive labor, whether at work or at home,
providing a platform for rebellious movements, such as the
Situationist International (Highmore 2010).</p>

<h2><a id="NegAes">4. Negative Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
This account of everyday life as pervaded by negative aesthetic
qualities rather than lacking any aesthetic qualities gives rise to
&lsquo;negative aesthetics.&rsquo; This notion may at first appear to
be an oxymoron, if &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; is understood in the usual
honorific sense. Katya Mandoki and Arnold Berleant stress the
importance of attending to this aesthetically negative aspect of
people&rsquo;s lives that is unfortunately all too common (Mandoki
2007; Berleant 2010, 2012, 2023a). Negative aesthetic qualities such
as ugliness, grotesqueness, repulsiveness, and disgust have not been
absent in the prevailing aesthetics discourse, but they don&rsquo;t
occupy a prominent place (notable exceptions being Korsmeyer 2011,
Forsey 2016). Furthermore, more often than not, these negative
qualities become justified as a necessary means to facilitating an
ultimately positive aesthetic experience. For example, a disgusting
content of art may be necessary for conveying an overall message, such
as an expos&eacute; and critique of social ills, or a repulsive sight
in nature, such as a predator devouring its prey, can be appreciated
as an integral part of nature&rsquo;s process.</p>

<p>
Negative aesthetic qualities experienced as negative, in comparison,
are unfortunately quite pervasive in everyday life and they directly
affect the quality of life. They range from less noteworthy qualities
such as the boring, the monotonous, the uninspiring, the banal, and
the dull to &ldquo;aesthetic violence,&rdquo; &ldquo;aesthetic
pain,&rdquo; &ldquo;aesthetic poisoning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;aesthetic
assault,&rdquo; such as the hideous, the offensive, the repulsive, and
the vulgar (Mandoki 2007). These more dramatically negative qualities
can be experienced in a squalid urban space, deafening noise,
cluttered billboard with gaudy signage and sordid visual images,
stench from a nearby factory, and the like. In light of the fact that
aesthetics has tended to confine its scope to positive qualities and
experiences, everyday aesthetics challenges us to pay serious
attention to the aesthetically negative aspects of our lives because
of their immediate impact on the quality of life.</p>

<p>
The focus on negative aesthetics is particularly important in everyday
aesthetics discourse because it leads to what may be regarded as its
activist dimension. When confronted with negative aesthetic qualities,
we generally don&rsquo;t remain a mere spectator but rather spring
into action to eliminate, reduce, or transform them. Even if we
don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t act, we wish we could do so and we think we
should. According to the prevailing mode of aesthetic analysis
regarding art, and to a certain extent nature, our aesthetic life is
primarily characterized from a spectator&rsquo;s point of view. We do
not perform an activity with the object other than aesthetic
engagement. Even if we are inspired to act by art or nature, the
resultant action is generally indirect, such as joining a political
movement or making a contribution to an organization.</p>

<p>
In comparison, the action we undertake motivated by negative
aesthetics in daily life has a direct impact on life. On a personal
level, we launder a stained shirt and iron it, clean the carpet soiled
by spilled wine, repaint the living room wall, open a window to get
fresh air after cooking fish indoors, tidy up the guest room, reformat
a document for a clearer look, and the list goes on (Forsey 2016;
Saito 2017). These actions are taken primarily in response to our
negative aesthetic reaction against stain, wrinkle, unpleasant color
of the wall, fishy smell, mess and clutter, and disorganized look. On
a community level, eyesore-like abandoned structures get torn down or
given a make-over, a squalid neighborhood gets cleaned up, and
ordinances are created to eliminate factory stench and cluttered
billboards. At least we often work, or believe we should work, toward
improving the aesthetics of everyday environment and life.</p>

<p>
At the same time, everyday aesthetics also urges us to critically
examine, and possibly transform, our common negative aesthetic
reactions to things and environments that do not conform to the
prevailing societal norms, what Sherri Irvin calls &ldquo;aesthetic
blight,&rdquo; such as differently-formed or -abled human bodies,
wildflower gardens, and artifacts showing wear and tear. It is because
such negative aesthetic judgements often lead to unjust treatments of
those humans, promotion of ecologically unsound environments, and
exacerbation of disposable culture fueled by consumerism. Negative
aesthetic experiences are thus useful and necessary in detecting what
is harmful to the quality of life and environment and provide an
impetus for improvement (Berleant 2012, 2023a; Irvin 2025; see Section
9 for further discussion).</p>

<h2><a id="EveAesQua">5. Everyday Aesthetic Qualities</a></h2>

<p>
However, questions can be raised as to whether qualities such as
messiness and clutter belong to aesthetics discourse. Appreciation of
more typical aesthetic qualities, such as beauty, sublimity, elegance,
grace, artistic excellence, powerful expression, and the like, is
thought to require a certain degree of aesthetic sensibility or
&lsquo;taste&rsquo; that needs to be cultivated. Moreover, their
appreciation often demands a certain conceptual understanding of
things, such as the object&rsquo;s historical and cultural context,
the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre, and some basic information regarding
nature, among others. Aesthetic experience, after all, is expected to
promote a dialogical process between the experiencing agent and the
object, thereby widening and deepening one&rsquo;s sensuous,
emotional, imaginative, and intellectual capacity. Sometimes
characterized as <em>Bildung</em>, it should be an educational and
empowering experience.</p>

<p>
In comparison, according to this line of thinking, the detection of
the everyday aesthetic qualities in question, such as messiness,
shabbiness, cuteness, and prettiness, seems to result from an almost
knee-jerk reaction without any background knowledge, aesthetic
sophistication or reflective process, and, as such, does not make a
worthy subject matter for aesthetics.</p>

<p>
Two responses have been given to this challenge. First, even if some
qualities can be experienced without the same kind and degree of
aesthetic sensibility or sophistication required for art appreciation,
this alone does not render them outside the realm of aesthetics. Even
a seemingly unreflective response to qualities &ndash; such as dirty,
messy, and disorganized &ndash; is not free of a cultural and
contextual framework (Douglas 2002; Saito 2007). Second, it is
possible to provide a kind of sliding scale with one end requiring
utmost sensibility often obtained after extensive education and
practice, such as the ability to appreciate twelve-tone music,
Joyce&rsquo;s novels, Japanese Noh theater, and bogs, and the other
end requiring very little education and practice, such as Norman
Rockwell paintings, a lullaby, a sparkling jewelry piece, and a
colorful flower garden. Some aesthetic qualities can be considered
&lsquo;major league&rsquo; or heavy-weight while other aesthetic
qualities are &lsquo;minor league&rsquo; or light-weight, without
disqualifying the latter from the realm of the aesthetic altogether.
After all, they refer to our qualitative response to the sensory
experience of the objects and phenomena and some experiences are more
intense and profound than others without thereby denying the aesthetic
dimension of more simple and easy experiences (Leddy 1995, 1997,
2012a, 2012b; Harris 2000; Ngai 2012; Postrel 2013; Mollar 2014).</p>

<p>
If minor league aesthetic qualities lack sophistication and profundity
compared to major league aesthetic qualities, a case can be made that
they make up for this lack by their pervasiveness in daily life with
serious consequences. While we do experience beauty and sublimity in
our daily life, such occasions are rather rare. More often than not,
in our everyday life, we experience things for being pretty, nice,
interesting, cute, sweet, adorable, boring, plain, drab, dowdy,
shabby, gaudy, ostentatious, and the like. It is particularly
important to attend to these qualities because, due to their
prevalence and relatively easy recognition, they exert a powerful
influence on our decisions and actions regarding mundane matters.
Indeed, strategies in advertising, political campaigning, and
propaganda often make use of these qualities to direct people&rsquo;s
behavior (Postrel 2003; B&ouml;hme 2003, 2017; Mandoki 2007; Sartwell
2010; Saito 2017, 2018). Those who are concerned with both the
prevalence and uncritical acceptance of aestheticization of life argue
for a more active, engaged, reflective mode of perception instead of
passively experiencing and being affected by aestheticization ploys,
thereby cultivating aesthetic literacy and vigilance (Vihalem 2016;
Matteucci 2017; Potgieter 2017; Berleant 2023a).</p>

<p>
Another worry has been raised about the aesthetic worthiness, or
&ldquo;aesthetic credentials,&rdquo; of some experiences (Dowling
2010). It concerns the purely bodily-oriented responses such as the
sensation of scratching an itch, receiving a massage, drinking tea, or
smelling fishy odor (Irvin 2008a,b). There is a concern that they are
too private and subjective to allow any inter-subjective discussion
and critical discourse, resulting in subjective relativism and
compromising the possibility of <em>sensus communis</em>. Kant&rsquo;s
distinction between the beautiful and the merely agreeable is often
invoked to support this criticism (Parsons and Carlson 2008; Soucek
2009; Dowling 2010).</p>

<p>
In response, some thinkers point out that it is a mistake to treat
these bodily sensations as an isolated, singular sensory experience.
According to them, in ordinary life, we almost never have an
experience of smell, taste, or touch by itself. Instead, our
experiences are usually multi-sensory or synaesthetic and take place
in a specific context (Howes 2005; Howes and Classen 2014). Scratching
an itch can be a part of experiencing a mosquito-infested bog, or
experienced as an annoyance caused by the stiff fabric label sewn on
the inside of a new shirt collar. The taste of tea cannot be separated
from its aroma, visual appearance, and the tactile sensations of
texture and warmth as one holds the mug and presses the lip against
its rim. All of these sensory experiences take place in a certain
surrounding and situation with its own ambiance, as well as within the
specific flow of one&rsquo;s daily life. One may grab a cup of tea on
the run and gulp it down to get the caffeine kick as one rushes to a
meeting, or savor each sip as one sits in front of a fireplace
relaxing, or participate in the Japanese tea ceremony. Even if the tea
itself were to remain the same, the experience surrounding its
ingestion changes, sometimes even affecting our experience of the
taste of tea itself (Irvin 2009a; Melchionne 2011, 2014; Perullo 2016;
Saito 2017). Thus, purely bodily sensation can be folded into the
atmosphere or ambiance constituted by many ingredients. Then what we
appreciate is not merely a singular bodily sensation in isolation such
as the tactile sensation or smell but the fittingness or, one may even
say, Kantian &lsquo;purposiveness,&rsquo; or lack thereof, created by
the relationship between and among factors making up the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>
Presumed subjective relativism regarding a purely bodily sensation,
therefore, can be mitigated at least to a certain extent if it is
regarded as one of the many ingredients that make up a larger whole
permeated by a unified atmosphere, such as a sense of well-being,
contentment, comfort, or negatively, a sense of isolation, discomfort,
uneasiness, or anxiety. Such an appreciation (or depreciation) allows
some degree of inter-subjective communication and sharing; indeed many
literary narratives provide a rich reservoir of such experiences.</p>

<h2><a id="AmbAesSocAes">6. Ambient Aesthetics and Social Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
This attention to atmosphere or ambiance of a certain situation
constituted by various ingredients has a long tradition in Japanese
aesthetics (Saito 2005). It was also the main point of the
associationist aesthetics advocated by Archibald Alison
(1757&ndash;1839). Today ambient aesthetics is garnering a renewed
attention primarily due to works by Gernot B&ouml;hme who suggests
that atmosphere should be the central focus of new aesthetics. In our
daily life, we often experience the atmospheric character of a
situation: tense or relaxed, cheerful or melancholic, exuberant or
subdued, inviting or alienating, electrifying or dull. Sometimes a
distinct character of a situation is intentionally orchestrated,
oftentimes in a special occasion like a wedding or a funeral, with
specifically selected music, decorations, attire, and choreographed
movements, to name a few (Z. Wang and Brubaker 2024). Some other
times, a unified atmosphere arises spontaneously when various elements
making up the physical environment and human interactions and
movements within it happen to congeal (B&ouml;hme 1993, 1998; Miyahara
2014; di Stefano 2017).</p>

<p>
Although in our daily life we experience and appreciate (or
depreciate) a certain atmosphere or ambiance quite frequently, it has
not received adequate attention in the aesthetics discourse primarily
because of the lack of clearly defined and delineated
&lsquo;object&rsquo; of the experience. Without a clear
&lsquo;frame&rsquo; around the object of experience, critics suggest,
inter-subjective discussion of its aesthetics is not possible. Nor are
there clear criteria, such as art historical conventions, that are
helpful in determining what is and is not a part of the aesthetic
experience (Parsons and Carlson 2008). Ambiance, air, or atmosphere is
indeed subjectively-oriented in the sense that one&rsquo;s experience
becomes colored accordingly. However, it should also be noted that it
is not purely subjective or private, as claimed by critics, insofar as
it refers to objectively identifiable features of the environment and
situation. Furthermore, some contemporary works of art specifically
aim at creating a certain atmosphere that envelops the audience,
<em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> being a precursor (Z. Wang 2018).</p>

<p>
Ambient aesthetics also highlights the important role played by
non-visual sensory experiences that permeate our lived life. The
relevance of the so-called lower senses in everyday aesthetics has
already been mentioned (Section 5). However, possibly with an
exception of the gustatory, non-visual sensory experiences, namely the
auditory, the olfactory, and the haptic, tend to be eclipsed by the
visual, although their contribution to our everyday aesthetic
experience is undeniable (Ackerman 1991; Tuan 1993; Brady 2005; Howes
2014; Korsmeyer 2017; <em>Interference Journal</em> (Issue 7, 2019);
Shiner 2020). Sometimes they enrich an overall ambiance, such as a
calming ambient sound and a weather-beaten smooth surface of a
building, while other times they constitute negative aesthetics, such
as a blaring car stereo sound and a stench from a nearby factory.
Furthermore, the lack of sounds and smell may be a welcome relief
while at other times it may render the experience deficient (Drobnick
2005; Anderson 2020). Everyday aesthetics encourages attention to
these non-visual elements of experiences, which helps sharpen our
sensibility. Attention to these sensory experiences is also critical
in architectural practice and urban planning which tend to be
dominated by the visual orientation (Pearson 1991; Pallasmaa
1999).</p>

<p>
Part of what determines the ambiance or atmosphere is human
interactions. The character of such interactions is constituted by the
participants&rsquo; personality and relationships with others that are
subject to aesthetic considerations. In addition to what one does and
says, one can be considered warm, cold, formal, aloof, friendly,
intimidating, gentle, and so forth, largely due to aesthetic factors
such as tone of voice, way of speaking, facial expression, bodily
gesture and posture, and outward presentation such as clothing, hair
style, ornamentation, and the like. Sometimes the moral character of
one&rsquo;s action is assessed by aesthetic dimensions over and beyond
what the action accomplishes. For example, one may gobble up a
lovingly prepared and meticulously arranged meal carelessly and
indifferently, or one may take time and savor every bite respectfully
and mindfully to show one&rsquo;s respect for the food and
appreciation for the cook. One can close a door roughly, making a loud
noise and startling others, or one can close it gently and carefully
so as not to disturb others. Finally, one can help a person in need
grudgingly and spitefully or do so with care and good cheer (Buss
1999; Sherman 2005; Naukkarinen 2014; Shusterman 2016; Saito 2016,
2022).</p>

<p>
In these examples, important desiderata in aesthetic experiences can
also be regarded as desirable in human relationships: open-mindedness
to accept and appreciate diversity, respect and reciprocity, full and
sincere engagement, among others. Established as a sub-category of
everyday aesthetics by Arnold Berleant, social aesthetics calls
attention to the fact that the aesthetics plays a surprising and often
unrecognized role in determining the moral character of actions,
persons, and human interactions (Eaton 2001; Berleant 2010, 2012,
2023a; Saito 2022).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, social aesthetics promotes cultivating virtues through
everyday practice. One&rsquo;s kindness, compassion, thoughtfulness,
and respect require appropriate expressions guided by aesthetic
sensibility and skills, in addition to accomplishing a certain deed.
Harmonious and cooperative interaction with others also requires not
only appropriate cultural knowledge but also aesthetic sensibility to
decipher group dynamics and determine how best to help create a
certain atmosphere (Naukkarinen 2014). A mere conceptual understanding
of the importance of aesthetic considerations in these interactions is
not sufficient. Embodied practice is required to contribute to
aesthetically-minded social interactions (Saito 2022).</p>

<h2><a id="ActOriAes">7. Action-Oriented Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
Social aesthetics also sheds light on another new avenue of inquiry
ushered in by everyday aesthetics: the first person account of the
aesthetic dimension of <em>doing</em> things instead of, or in
addition to, the experience gained as a spectator or beholder. The
traditional mode of aesthetic inquiry is primarily concerned with
analyzing the aesthetic experience of a spectator who derives
aesthetic pleasure from contemplating an object (or a phenomenon or an
event). Even in such an experience, as Dewey&rsquo;s characterization
of &lsquo;undergoing&rsquo; and &lsquo;doing&rsquo; and
Berleant&rsquo;s engagement model indicate, the person is never
passive; she is actively engaged with the object through exercising
imagination and interacts with it perceptually, intellectually, and
emotionally. However, in the most literal sense, she is still an
onlooker of the object: a painting, a symphony, a tea bowl, a figure
skating performance, a flower garden, a piece of furniture, an
automobile, a house, and a freshly laundered shirt.</p>

<p>
While everyday aesthetics includes such spectator-oriented aesthetics,
a major part constituting the flow of everyday life is our active
engagement with doing things by handling an object, executing an act,
and producing certain results, often motivated by aesthetic
considerations. Until recently, very little had been explored of the
aesthetic dimensions of active involvement in painting a canvas,
playing a violin, skating, gardening, repairing a garment, hanging
laundry outdoors, and giving birth (Rautio 2009; Brook 2012; Lintott
2012; Saito 2025). Perhaps food aesthetics illustrates this contrast
most clearly. Food aesthetics generally focuses on the taste of the
food rather than the experience of eating itself or the activity of
cooking (except for Curtin and Heldke 1992; Visser 1997; Giard 1998;
Korsmeyer 1999; Shusterman 2013; Perullo 2016; Saito 2026).</p>

<p>
The difficulty of accounting for the aesthetics involved in these
activities from the participants&rsquo; perspective is the same
difficulty facing ambient aesthetics: the lack of clear delineation of
object-hood of aesthetic experience. The constituents of an aesthetic
object are more or less clear in the case of a painting or a flower
garden appreciated from the spectator&rsquo;s point of view.
Furthermore, there is an object one can point to for
intersubjectivity. However, there is no equivalent
&lsquo;object&rsquo; of aesthetic experience when it comes to an
activity one undertakes. This lack, according to some thinkers,
signals the demise of any reasonable discussion as the subject matter
becomes hopelessly private with little possibility of intersubjective
discourse. While we can meaningfully debate the aesthetic merit of a
painting or a flower garden by giving reasons to justify our judgment,
it is difficult to imagine an equivalent discussion of my experience
of bodily engagement when executing brush ink painting or digging the
ground and planting flowers for the flower garden.</p>

<p>
If one accepts John Dewey&rsquo;s notion of having &ldquo;an
experience&rdquo; which gives an aesthetic character to whatever
experience one is undergoing, it becomes a challenge to facilitate a
critical discourse to determine whether or not one is truly having
&ldquo;an experience.&rdquo; The act of planting flowers involves a
multi-sensory experience and bodily engagement, as well as designing
the garden&rsquo;s layout. These ingredients may come together in a
unified manner to give rise to a sense of joy felt by the gardener at
the arrival of spring and the anticipation of fully-blossomed flowers.
It is difficult to imagine how this gardener&rsquo;s experience can be
subjected to a critical discourse in the same way the flower bed gets
evaluated aesthetically for its design. Can we have a debate about
whether the gardener&rsquo;s experience was truly aesthetic or whether
it provided a rich or only mediocre aesthetic experience? If not, is
this aspect of our life forever closed to any mode of aesthetic
inquiry?</p>

<p>
The difficulty felt here regarding the aesthetics of ambiance and
actions could be attributed to the mode of contemporary Western
aesthetic inquiry which is predominantly judgment-oriented (B&ouml;hme
1993). Much of mainstream aesthetic debate surrounds the objectivity
and justifiability of aesthetic judgment. A judgment presupposes the
determinability of an object and its intersubjectively sharable
experience. Anything falling outside of it is considered hopelessly
subjective and relativistic. However, phenomenological accounts of
bodily engagement in cooking, sports, and other mundane activities are
plentiful not only in some aestheticians&rsquo; descriptive aesthetics
writings but also, perhaps more commonly, in writings by practitioners
and literary authors (Curtin and Heldke 1992; Giard 1998; Rautio 2009;
Tainio 2015; several essays in Man and Petts 2023). Body aesthetics is
also garnering more attention in recent philosophy and a large part of
its concern is the bodily engagement in aesthetic experience (Bhatt
2013; Irvin 2016).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, some agree that the practice of mundane activities,
domestic chores in particular, provides an opportunity for one to
exercise imagination and creativity to inspire an aesthetic experience
(McCracken 2001; Lee 2010; Highmore 2011a; Saito 2025). For example,
the activity of outdoor laundry hanging can be a chance for the person
to arrange and hang the items in an aesthetically pleasing way to
express her respect and thoughtfulness toward her neighbors and
passersby who are inevitably exposed to the visual parade of laundered
items. At the same time, this activity will occasion her appreciation
of the arrival of spring after a long winter, as well as anticipation
of the sweet smell and crisp texture of dried items thanks to the
sunshine and fresh air carried by the breeze (Rautio 2009; Saito
2017). Dismissing these experiences from aesthetic discourse because
they do not fit the expected format of analysis and cannot be
subjected to a verdict-oriented discourse unduly impoverishes the rich
content of our aesthetic life. In addition, these experiences are not
hopelessly private and it is possible that they are generated and
shared communally. Gardening, cooking, and participation in sporting
activities can be a group activity and the participants can share and
help with each other to mutually enrich and enhance aesthetic
experiences by pointing out the aesthetic contribution of some aspects
that others may have missed.</p>

<p>
Indeed, it is crucial for everyday aesthetics that these private
experiences to be intersubjectively communicable. If the aesthetic
dimensions of our everyday life are important (and this conviction is
what gave rise to everyday aesthetics in the fist place), then one of
its tasks is to justify the value of seemingly monadistic experiences
by facilitating what aesthetic experience in general does best:
encouraging openness by sharing others&rsquo; experiences, viewing the
world from perspectives different from one&rsquo;s own, and enlarging
one&rsquo;s horizon and vision (Ratiu 2017a). Aesthetic experience
understood in this way supports its educability, educational value,
and contribution to enhancing life (Potgieter 2017).</p>

<h2><a id="BluLinBetArtLif">8. Blurring the Line between Art and Life</a></h2>

<p>
The emergence of everyday aesthetics discourse parallels the
increasing attempt at blurring the distinction between art and life in
today&rsquo;s artworld. Although there have been many examples
throughout art history of <em>depicting</em> slices of everyday life,
such as Dutch still life paintings, twentieth-century art introduced
and experimented with different modes of appropriating everyday life,
most famously with the use of ready-mades. Since then, artists have
been trying to overcome the presumed separation between art and real
life in a number of ways: rejecting the art institutional setting as a
location for their art; denying the necessity of authorial authority;
embracing various changes made to their works both by nature and human
agency; blurring the creator/spectator dichotomy by collaborating with
the general public to create art as a joint venture; changing the role
of the artist from the creator/choreographer to a facilitator who
provides an occasion or an event for things to happen; literally
improving the environment and society by planting trees, cleaning a
river, and playing the role of a social worker to promote a dialogue
among people in conflict; and engaging in mundane activities like
cooking and farming with tangible products for consumption. These
attempts have given rise to a number of genres, including situationist
art, conceptual art, environmental art, happening, performance,
activist art, socially engaged art, and art projects characterized as
embodying &ldquo;relational aesthetics&rdquo; or &ldquo;dialogical
aesthetics&rdquo; (Kaprow 1993; Spaid 2002, 2012; Bourriaud 2002;
Kester 2004, 2011; Dezeuze 2006; Johnstone 2008; Bishop 2012).</p>

<p>
Paralleling the movement of art to embrace everyday life, there is a
movement in the opposite direction: for everyday life to embrace art.
While aestheticization of life is not a new phenomenon, what is
noteworthy in the so-called organizational aesthetics and artification
strategy is that they deploy art and art-like ways of thinking and
acting in those areas of life which have not been traditionally
associated with art or aesthetics: medicine, business, education,
sports, and science, among others, as well as organizational life in
general (Dars&oslash; 2004; Naukkarinen and Saito 2012; Ratiu 2017b).
These professional practices typically privilege rational discourse
comprised of logic and rules, but they cannot ignore their aesthetic
dimensions. Art and aesthetics in this context are not regarded as
decorative amenities or prettifying touches. Rather, organizational
aesthetics and artification strategy are based upon the premise that
humans negotiate life, whatever the context may be, through sensory
knowledge and affective experiences by interacting with others and the
environment. As such, working with the aesthetic dimensions of these
professional activities and environments cannot but help achieve the
respective goals and, perhaps more importantly, contribute to the
wellbeing of the members and participants. Art and aesthetics can be a
powerful ally in directing human endeavors and actions and determining
the quality of activities and environments. Such effects range from
facilitating creativity and imagination in educational and business
ventures and providing humane and healing environments for vulnerable
populations, such as hospital patients and nursing home residents, to
rendering scientific data easily graspable (Pine and Gilmore 1998;
Linstead 2000; Postrel 2003; Howes 2005, 2013; Duncum 2007; Tavin
2007; Dee 2010, 2012; Schulze 2013; Moss and O&rsquo;Neill 2013, 2014;
Ratiu 2017b; Krawczyk 2019; many essays in Poltrum, et al 2025).</p>

<p>
As stated at the beginning of this entry, everyday aesthetics was
first proposed as a way of accounting for those aesthetically charged
dimensions of our lives that had not been adequately addressed by
art-centered aesthetics. However, early works of everyday aesthetics,
such as given by Saito (2007), are criticized for a rather outdated
and overly restrictive characterization of so-called art-centered
aesthetics. The presumed distinguishing conditions of art-aesthetics,
such as a relatively clear frame, privileging higher senses, authorial
identity, stable identity of the object, and the spectator mode of
experience, are no longer applicable to many examples of art today.
Consequently, the critics urge everyday aesthetics to go beyond simply
providing a venue to enumerate those aesthetic dimensions of everyday
life that had previously been overlooked and to provide a conceptual
foundation. In particular, they advocate conceiving everyday
aesthetics as a continuation of aesthetics discourse that had
previously been focused on art. This debate is described variously as
between the weak and strong formulations, continuistic and
discontinuistic poles, extraordinarilist and familiarity stances, or
monolithist and pluralist models (see Dowling 2010; Ratiu 2013;
Iannilli 2016; Matteucci 2016 for a clear and helpful
&ldquo;mapping&rdquo; and &ldquo;nomenclature&rdquo; of these strands
of everyday aesthetics).</p>

<p>
Those who support the continuity model are specifically concerned to
provide a basis for intersubjectivity and normativity for everyday
aesthetics by referencing these features that support aesthetics
discourse in general. Without such a framework, the worry is that
everyday aesthetics may degenerate into a totally subjective, laissez
faire affair which would render the entire project trivial. Unless we
presuppose the possibility of a <em>sensus communis</em>, that is,
communicability though not necessarily commonality, which makes
sharing and understanding the other&rsquo;s experience possible, we
are locked into a subjective, solipsistic silo. Furthermore, they
point out that the monadic characterization of everyday aesthetics
within the general aesthetics discourse is not conducive to fruitfully
accounting for the ways in which everyday life and art interact and
form a continuous, ongoing flux of a person&rsquo;s embodied
experience of the lived world. Popular and socially engaged forms of
art permeate people&rsquo;s everyday life more than ever and there is
no reason not to consider experiencing them as a pervasive dimension
of their lived world. Ultimately, the nature of art is open and
dynamic and is very much an integral part of people&rsquo;s life, and
everyday aesthetics is better served by considering the continuity
between art and everyday. In other words, the initial reactionary mode
of everyday aesthetics needs to be recast as a proactive mode that
addresses the totality of our aesthetic engagement with the world,
which includes art, nature, and the everyday (Ratiu 2013; Potgieter
2017). Although approaching the issue from a different angle, another
possibility is to develop Ranci&egrave;re&rsquo;s distribution of the
sensible and explore what is deemed aesthetically relevant within a
specific cultural/historical/social context. For the consideration of
the regime of the sensible, the presumed distinction between art and
life becomes irrelevant (Vihalem 2018).</p>

<h2><a id="SigEveAes">9. Significance of Everyday Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
As the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of aestheticization of life
indicates, the aesthetic has a significant power to influence,
sometimes determine, the quality of life and society. While the power
of everyday aesthetics can be harnessed to improve the quality of
life, it can also be used to serve a political agenda or a business
goal. As stated in the sections on the Everyday Aesthetic Qualities
and Action-Oriented Aesthetics above, everyday aesthetic responses
often directly guide people&rsquo;s actions. If something attracts us
with its aesthetic appeal, we tend to protect it, purchase it, or try
to maintain its aesthetic value; on the other hand, if we don&rsquo;t
find an object or an environment aesthetically appealing, we tend to
be indifferent to its fate, discard it, or try to make it more
attractive (Nassauer 1995; Orr 2002). In particular, today&rsquo;s
global capitalist economy is fueled by &lsquo;perceived
obsolescence&rsquo; regarding products&rsquo; fashionableness and
stylishness with little to no improvement in their functional values.
Additional aesthetic &lsquo;hidden persuaders&rsquo; include branding,
advertising campaigns, and aesthetically orchestrated store
environments (Pine and Gilmore 1998, 2013; Postrel 2003; Schulze 2013;
B&ouml;hme 2017). These positive aesthetic values of and surrounding a
product often hide various instances of &lsquo;ugliness&rsquo;
involved in its manufacturing process and afterlife. The negative
aesthetics associated with manufacturing includes environmental
devastation caused by resource extraction and pollution, and dismal
working conditions of the factory workers, often in developing
nations, who are forced to endure aesthetic damage and deprivation,
not to mention health and safety hazards. The negative aesthetics of
the product&rsquo;s afterlife can be seen in the ever-increasing
volume of discarded items, no longer considered trendy and
fashionable, not only in municipal landfills but in the ocean. Such
&lsquo;trash&rsquo; is also shipped to developing nations where
re-usable, and often toxic, parts are harvested by local people with
no protective gear (Saito 2018).</p>

<p>
Negative consequences of people&rsquo;s aesthetic preference can also
be found in the uniformly perfect appearance of fruits and vegetables
on the store shelf. The deformed and misshapen items are sometimes
discarded, causing not only literal waste but also creation of methane
gas from rotting produce. The American attraction to the weed-free,
velvety-smooth, uniformly green lawn has serious environmental
ramifications, such as excessive use of water, chemical fertilizer,
herbicide, and insecticide. When outdoor laundry hanging and wind
turbines are judged to be an eyesore, communities create an ordinance
to prohibit them, preventing the opportunity to create a more
sustainable way of living (Duerksen and Goebel 1999; Gipe 2002; Gray
2012; Saito 2017).</p>

<p>
Contrariwise, the success of sustainable design and goods produced
under humane conditions often depends upon the acceptance of new
aesthetic paradigms, such as gardens consisting of wildflowers or
edible plants, garments and furniture made with recycled or reused
materials, and green buildings that reduce literal footprints on the
land as well as carbon footprints (Walker 2006, 2017; Salwa 2019).
Some work has also been done to explore the ways in which moral
virtues such as respect, thoughtfulness, and humility can be expressed
not only by persons but also by the aesthetic features of objects and
built structures and environments (Norman 1990; Whiteley 1993, 1999;
Sep&auml;nmaa 1995a, 1995b; Pallasmaa 1999; Taylor 2000; Orr 2002;
Berleant and Carlson 2007; Berleant 2010, 2012; Saito 2017, 2022). In
addition, as indicated by social aesthetics, cultivation of aesthetic
sensibility and practice of aesthetic skills can contribute to
facilitating respectful, thoughtful, and humane social
interactions</p>

<p>
The relationship between the aesthetic and the ethical has been one of
the contested issues in the aesthetics discourse regarding art.
Debates ensue regarding the aesthetic relevance of the moral content
of art, the artist&rsquo;s or performer&rsquo;s character, and the
process involved in creating a work of art. The positions range from
their complete separation supported by aestheticism or autonomism to
their integration advocated by moralists. Just as in art-centered
aesthetics, there are differing views on whether or not and to what
degree the ethical implications should affect the aesthetic value of
the objects of daily use. Some prefer to separate them and protect the
autonomous realm of the aesthetic (Parsons and Carlson 2008; Forsey
2013). Others advocate integration by calling for an aesthetic
paradigm shift (Orr 2002; Maskit 2011) not only by explicitly
including the moral dimensions of objects and environments when
considering their aesthetic values but also by rethinking the
fundamental ways in which we humans interact with the material world.
At least according to the Western tradition, the material world lacks
any agency in a morally relevant sense and its value is exhausted by
its instrumental utility to humans. However, just as the long-held
Western anthropocentric attitude toward nature has come under
scrutiny, some thinkers propose a more respectful attitude toward and
interaction with the material world (Ingold 2000; Nielsen 2005; Brook
2012; Perullo 2016; Saito 2022).</p>

<p>
The moral, social, and political significance of everyday aesthetics
is perhaps most acute in body aesthetics. Culturally- and
socially-constructed, and often impossible to achieve, aesthetic
standards of the human body lead people to engage in various beauty
practices, ranging from cosmetic surgery and extreme dieting to
ingestion of dangerous substances and bleaching of the skins, which
often compromise health (Brand 2000, 2012; Lintott 2003; Rhode 2010;
Archer and Ware 2018; Widdows 2018). Aesthetics is also implicated as
a primary instrument of justifying the societal oppression of
disabled, sexed, gendered, or racialized bodies. Those individuals
whose bodies do not meet the aesthetic standard suffer from an
unfounded perception that their physical appearance correlates with
their competence, intelligence, and moral character, and are subjected
to many forms of injustice and discrimination in employment, social
standing, personal relationships, and economic status. Aesthetic
qualifications for an ideal body can be explicitly institutionalized
as in Nazism or policies requiring a certain appearance of employees,
or implicitly referenced to reinforce the existing stereotype of the
oppressed groups (Garland-Thomson 2009; Siebers 2010; Irvin 2016; P.
Taylor 2016; also see the entries on
 <a href="../feminist-body/">feminist perspectives on the body</a>,
 <a href="../feminism-disability/">feminist perspectives on disability</a>,
 and
 <a href="../feminism-objectification/">feminist perspectives on objectification</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The utilization of aesthetics as a strategy for consumerism and
political agenda has thus been a concern for everyday aesthetics.
Aesthetic appeal can entice people to embrace, support, and promote
problematic causes that may be ultimately contrary to their wellbeing
and quality of life, as well as to the ideal of justice and democracy.
Instead of nurturing citizens and civil society engaged in a
thoughtful and informed exchange, discussion, and critical reflections
of ideas, aestheticization of everyday life is often used to cultivate
consumers for the market, audience for political spectacles, and
accomplices in perpetuating oppression and injustice. However, this
danger of aestheticization of everyday life is not necessarily
inevitable. Some argue that it is possible and indeed critical that we
encourage an aestheticization strategy in the service of promoting
justice, democracy, citizenry, and civil discourse (Nielsen 2005;
Matteucci 2017).</p>

<h2><a id="Con">10. New and Future Developments</a></h2>

<p>
While everyday aesthetics has matured significantly since its
relatively recent emergence in the Western aesthetics discourse, there
still remain many tasks to be tackled. In light of the new
developments described below, possibilities and opportunities abound
to guide the future of everyday aesthetics.</p>

<p>
First, many critics, as well as supporters, of everyday aesthetics
point out that it needs to be anchored in a firm theoretical
foundation (Forsey 2013a; Ratiu 2013; Iannilli 2016). Among the
possibilities suggested are finding roots in phenomenology,
structuralism and poststructuralism, in addition to pragmatism that is
often cited as the primary root (Potgieter 2017). Also suggested is to
frame everyday aesthetics as a practical philosophy with its emphasis
on practical knowledge that is contingent and relational as well as
providing agency for acting for common good (Vihalem 2016; Ratiu
2017a). Another suggestion is to provide a theory of aesthetic
perception based upon a specific mode of attention (Nanay 2016, 2018).
These suggestions are made specifically to address the perceived
conflicts and tensions debated by everyday aestheticians between
everyday and non-everyday, life and art, theory and practice, ordinary
and extraordinary, routine and non-routine, familiar and unfamiliar,
and bodily-oriented (lower) senses and cognitively-oriented (higher)
senses. A firm theoretical footing should also support
intersubjectivity of aesthetic experience so as not to render everyday
aesthetics hopelessly subjective and trivial, one of the common
criticisms lodged against it. In addition, a theoretical foundation is
thought to help illuminate the political dimensions of everyday
aesthetics, specifically the politically charged regime of the
sensible and the increasing aestheticization of commerce and politics
that treats people more as consumers than as citizens.</p>

<p>
Second, as was discussed in Section 2, what counts as everyday is a
complicated matter, and one of the complications is the fact that our
lived world is changing rapidly owing to technological development and
climate change. We cannot imagine our everyday life today without the
use of internet, social media, Googling, big data, virtual reality,
and the like, which dramatically altered the life of older
generations. In addition, the envisioned future with smart homes,
self-driving vehicles, wearable technology, and AI is already here,
affecting the nature of our everyday life by the integration of the
digital world and virtual reality (&#321;ukaszewicz and Petri 2022).
Furthermore, many people&rsquo;s natural and built environments are
bound to be transformed by climate change, compromising the security
and stability of &lsquo;home&rsquo; for many and drastically changing
their everyday affairs and cultural practices (Nomikos 2018). While
these transformations of the everyday may be incremental, some changes
are rather abrupt and unexpected due to a one-off event such as a
natural disaster and warfare. Finally, one&rsquo;s life circumstances,
such as poverty, can make their everyday life precarious, robbing them
of a stable anchor for their ongoing struggles (Enroth 2021).</p>

<p>
It may be the case that the new normal for our everyday world will
become a rapid and constant change. This future projection may require
everyday aestheticians to review some of the presuppositions that have
supported their thinking, the primary among them being the
characterization of the everyday as stability, routine, safety,
familiarity, and comfort with a more or less predictable future
prospect. The challenge then is to explore whether and how the
changing experiences of the everyday affect the nature of everyday
aesthetics. Some works have already begun, indicated by the research
on the effects of self-driving vehicles (Mladenovi&#263;, et al 2019),
cartographical tools (Iannilli 2014; Lehtinen 2019), the prevalence of
all kinds of machine in general (Naukkarinen 2019), and the effects of
AI on aesthetics as a discourse (Iannilli and Naukkarinen 2025).</p>

<p>
While the specific issues to address may vary according to how the
world itself and one&rsquo;s life circumstances change, one could
argue that the general issues in everyday aesthetics remain constant.
One such issue is aesthetic engagement with the world through embodied
experience. This ranges from how one uses digital technology in the
management of everyday life to the visceral experience of one&rsquo;s
living environment being destroyed and dealing with constant precarity
of life prospects. Another issue is the power of the aesthetic to help
one cope with challenging life circumstances, whether caused by
illness, poverty, losing loved ones, or destruction of home and
community (many articles in Poltrum et al 2025; Higgins, 2024; Al
Qudwa 2017).</p>

<p>
Third, everyday aesthetics has become influential in various
disciplines and practices outside of philosophical discourse. As
indicated by many works included in the bibliography, everyday
aesthetics has been embraced as providing both principles and
strategies by fields ranging from business, consumerism, healthcare,
sports, law, science, and education to urban studies, sustainability,
fashion, and design. This wide acceptance and utilization of everyday
aesthetics is due to its insight regarding the prevalence of
aesthetics in everyone&rsquo;s lived world, as well as its aspiration
that cultivation of aesthetic literacy and sensibility will contribute
to improving one&rsquo;s wellbeing, social interactions, and the state
of the society and the world. But the challenge, as well as
opportunity, posed by these heterogeneous discipline-specific
practices is to inquire whether there is an overarching unifying
notion of aesthetic experience and aesthetic practice. Even if there
is a unifying notion, a further question is whether we should arrive
at such a notion by building on case studies from these various
disciplines (Vihalem 2016).</p>

<p>
Finally, in light of an increasing attention to the culture-specific
nature of various discourses, everyday aesthetics faces both the
opportunity and challenge for situating in a global context.
Globalization of aesthetics is actively sought particularly regarding
art, by decolonizing the discourses of art, art history, and museum
practice. It was explained at the beginning of this entry that
everyday aesthetics&rsquo; emergence was historically and culturally
situated to challenge what was considered to be art-centered
aesthetics that dominated the Western aesthetics of the last century.
In many cultural traditions, including those that do not have a
concept equivalent to the Western notion of art, there is a long
legacy of aesthetic interests and concerns permeating, informing, and
guiding people&rsquo;s lives, whether regarding the management of
daily life, social relationships, spiritual rites, cultural
activities, or creation of objects (see Higgins 1996 and Higgins, et
al. 2017 for a collection of essays representing diverse non-Western
aesthetic traditions). For example, the long-held Chinese tradition of
&ldquo;aesthetics of living&rdquo; that has been practiced as a way of
enhancing the quality of lived experience and contributing to
people&rsquo;s happiness and wellbeing, rather than conceived as an
abstract theory, is receiving a renewed attention by Chinese scholars
who are working on a cross-cultural dialogue (Liu 2014, 2017, 2018;
Pan 2014; Q. Wang 2014). Similarly, Japanese cultural tradition is
garnering an increasing interest by those who are exploring how its
aesthetic interests goes beyond the established arts to inform
people&rsquo;s everyday lives (Ikegami 2005; Sasaki 2013; Otabe 2018).
Researching how different cultural traditions promote their respective
everyday aesthetic practices helps to highlight the cultural
situatedness of some assumptions of Western philosophy and aesthetics,
such as the relationships between art and life, the theoretical and
the practical, the subject and the object, as well as between and
among the aesthetic, the moral, the social, the practical, the
existential, and the spiritual.</p>

<p>
Everyday aesthetics began its task in the spirit of inclusivity by
expanding the materials for deliberation. The discourse continues its
task with the same spirit of inclusivity by encouraging
culture-specific, discipline-specific, and future-speculative
explorations, while at the same time searching for a theoretical
foundation that allows for intersubjective, intercultural, and
interdisciplinary exchanges.</p>
