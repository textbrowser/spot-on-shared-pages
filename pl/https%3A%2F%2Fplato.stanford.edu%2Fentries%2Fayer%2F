<h1>Alfred Jules Ayer</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat May 7, 2005; substantive revision Tue Jan 14, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
A.J. Ayer (1910&ndash;1989) was only 24 when he wrote the book that
made his philosophical name, <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em>
(hereafter <em>LTL</em>), published in 1936. In it he put forward what
were understood to be the major theses of logical positivism, and so
established himself as the leading English representative of the
movement, Viennese in origin. In endorsing these views Ayer saw
himself as continuing in the line of British empiricism established by
John Locke and David Hume, an empiricism whose most recent
representative was Bertrand Russell. Throughout his subsequent career
he remained true to this tradition&rsquo;s rejection of the
possibility of synthetic <em>a priori</em> knowledge, and so he saw
the method of philosophy to be the analysis of the meaning of key
terms, such as &lsquo;causality&rsquo;, &lsquo;truth&rsquo;,
&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo;, and so on. The major
portion of his work was devoted to exploring different facets of our
claims to knowledge, particularly perceptual knowledge and knowledge
that depended on inductive inference for its credence. Along the way
he defended a &lsquo;justified true belief&rsquo; account of
knowledge, a Humean account of causation, and compatibilism with
respect to freedom. In <em>LTL</em> he put forward an emotivist theory
of ethics, one that he never abandoned.</p>

<p>
Ayer always wrote with stylish crispness and clarity; he could lay
bare the bones of a philosophical difficulty in a few paragraphs of
strikingly simple prose. On many a philosophical problem Ayer cannot
be bettered for providing a lucid, informative, and revealing
description of its contours. Above all, on reading an essay of his,
whether it be on basic propositions, sense data, induction, or
freedom, one comes away recognizing that the aim of the author has
been to reach the truth, no matter what that turned out to be.
Unfortunately, he sometimes rushed to reach it, which, together with
the directness of his style, gave him a reputation for mere cleverness
that he never lived down. Nevertheless, amongst British philosophers
of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century he has been ranked as second only to
Russell (Foster 1985); P.F. Strawson, at his memorial service, stated
that his contribution to the theory of knowledge and general
metaphysics was &ldquo;in no way inferior to Russell&rsquo;s&rdquo;
(see Rogers 1999, 358).</p>

<h2 id="BioSke">1. Biographical Sketch</h2>

<p>
Alfred Jules Ayer was born in London on October 29, 1910. His mother,
Reine, was descended from Dutch Jews, whilst his father, Jules Louis
Cypress Ayer, came from a Swiss Calvinist background. As recounted in
Rogers 1999, Ayer was a precocious but mischievous child, and so was
sent to boarding school (outside Eastbourne) at the age of seven, from
which he won a scholarship to Eton in 1923. There he impressed his
peers with his intelligence and competitiveness, the latter trait
manifesting itself in the way he played games. Ayer nevertheless felt
an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;, and it is clear that his fellow-students
did not warm to him, perhaps due to the excessive zeal with which he
attempted to convert them to atheism. Feeling &lsquo;an
outsider&rsquo; was something that remained with him all his life. At
the age of sixteen he specialized in classics and at the same time
started reading some philosophy. Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s
<em>Sceptical Essays</em> made an impression, particularly
Russell&rsquo;s argument for the claim that it is undesirable to
believe a proposition when there is no ground for believing its truth.
Ayer said that this remained a motto for him throughout his
philosophical career (see Rogers 1999, 45). At the same time a reading
of G.E. Moore&rsquo;s <em>Principia Ethica</em> also had a lasting
effect, particularly Moore&rsquo;s articulation of the Naturalistic
Fallacy.</p>

<p>
The Easter before leaving Eton, Ayer spent some time in Paris, where
he met Renee Lees, whom he subsequently married (in 1933). The
following year (1929) he won a classics scholarship to Christ Church,
Oxford, where he studied both Greek and philosophy, one of his tutors
being Gilbert Ryle (for the Oxford atmosphere, see Berlin 1973; Ryle
1970, 1976, 1999; Mehta 1965; for a comprehensive narrative see
Krishnan 2023). It was Ryle who suggested that Ayer read Ludwig
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>; as the
book immediately impressed him, Ayer gave a paper on the Tractatus in
early March 1932 to the Jowett Society in Oxford (a group intended for
undergraduates, see Rowe 2023, p. 91). After graduation, Ayer wanted
to study with Wittgenstein in Cambridge, but Ryle had a different
suggestion. As Wittgenstein was less relevant in Oxford, and since
Ryle had met Moritz Schlick, then leader of the 
  <a href="../vienna-circle/">Vienna Circle</a>, at the International
Congress for Philosophy in Oxford in 1930, he encouraged Ayer to go to
Vienna and bring home the Circle&rsquo;s latest views and results to
perform a &ldquo;public service&rdquo; (Ayer 1977, 121). Thus Ayer
went to Vienna, contacted Schlick to enter his philosophy of nature
course at the university and attended the private meetings of the
Circle in the library of the Mathematical Institute.  Between January
and March 1933 (when Ayer returned to Oxford), it was mainly Schlick,
Friedrich Waismann, Hans Hahn, Karl Menger, Kurt G&ouml;del,
occasionally Otto Neurath and presumably Felix Kaufmann who were
present at the discussions (Rudolf Carnap was already in Prague that
time), along with W. V. O. Quine. His philosophical experience in
Vienna was somewhat limited by his uncertain knowledge of German (as
he wrote to Ryle, &ldquo;[o]n the whole I have got very little out of
them all&rdquo; [Ayer to Ryle, February 19, 1933, quoted in
Harr&eacute; and Shosky 1999, 31]), but he knew enough to pick up the
basic tenets of logical positivism (on the similarities and
differences between Ayer and logical positivism, see Koterski 2023,
Pincock 2022, Tuboly 2021b, pp. 28&ndash;33, and Vrahimis 2021).</p>

<p>
After leaving Vienna, Ayer lectured for a short time at Christ Church,
where in 1935 he was elected to a five-year research fellowship. In
the same year he finished <em>LTL</em>, which caused a great deal of
controversy and debate, partly for its sweeping dismissal of
metaphysics, but especially for the metaethical emotivism Ayer
championed in one of its most notorious chapters. During the next few
years, Ayer worked at defending and refining some of the positions
adopted in <em>LTL</em>, not least at meetings in Oxford with Isaiah
Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, and J.L. Austin. The confrontations with
Austin were to prove long-lasting. The product of this refining
process was the book <em>Foundations of Empirical Knowledge.</em>
During this time he also enjoyed life to the full; he was a good
dancer, once confessing that he would have preferred to be a
tap-dancer rather than a professional philosopher, but had given up on
the idea when he recognized that he would never be as good as Fred
Astaire. His marriage to Renee started to disintegrate; Ayer had
numerous affairs, and Renee formed an enduring relationship with
Stuart Hampshire.</p>

<p>
In the immediate pre-war years, Ayer had become passionate about
politics. He supported the Republican side in Spain, flirted with
joining the Communist Party, but instead became an active member of
the Labour Party. When war was declared he joined the Welsh Guards
(and was helped to do so by Gilbert Ryle). He worked for a while in
Cambridge interrogating prisoners, then was sent to America to join a
secret service mission, one which seemed to involve gathering
information about Fascist sympathizers in America. Whilst in New York
he reviewed films for the <em>Nation</em>, fathered a daughter (Sheila
Graham was the mother), and made a record with Lauren Bacall. On being
repatriated to England, Ayer found himself given the job of helping
with the organization of the French resistance movements in London.
Shortly after the war he was posted to Paris, where he took the
opportunity to study French existentialism, writing articles on Sartre
and Camus in <em>Horizon</em>.</p>

<p>
On his release from Army service Ayer accepted the offer of a tutorial
fellowship at Wadham College, Oxford, but was there only a short while
before becoming the Grote Professor of Philosophy at University
College, London, at the age of 36. He quickly appointed Hampshire to a
lectureship (making up for having cited Hampshire as co-respondent in
his divorce from Renee), then Richard Wollheim. The department grew
and became a thriving philosophical center. Ayer also ventured into
the world of radio, being involved in many BBC Third Programme
broadcasts, including panel discussions with the scientists Zuckerman,
Huxley and Medawar, and a famous debate with the Jesuit priest
Frederick Copleston on the existence of God. Later he became a regular
performer on BBC television&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Brains Trust&rdquo;. In
1948 he lectured at Bard College in New York, but it proved to be an
unhappy experience. Back in London C.E.M. Joad had published an
article in the <em>New Statesman</em> arguing that <em>LTL</em> was
responsible for creating an environment in which Fascism flourished,
and <em>Time</em> magazine published an unflattering short article
claiming that Ayer taught his students that &ldquo;That man is good to
support his mother&rdquo; was a meaningless statement (Rogers 1999, p.
232). On his return to Europe he started a hectic schedule of lecture
tours, visiting France, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Peru, Chile,
Uruguay, and Brazil, all in the early 1950s.</p>

<p>
In 1958 Ayer took the opportunity to return to Oxford as Wykeham
Professor of Logic. He later said that this decision was made in order
to combat the growing influence of Austin, who had made a point of
attacking Ayer&rsquo;s views on perception. Austin was, however, soon
to die, making Ayer&rsquo;s &lsquo;sacrifice&rsquo; of his life in
London somewhat pointless. Not that it was completely sacrificed; he
bi-located, spending long weekends in London with his second wife, Dee
Wells, and at most three nights in New College during the week. He
continued to travel widely: China, Russia, India, and Pakistan were
added to the itinerary. He also continued his political activity,
continuing to support the Labour Party, campaigning against British
involvement in Vietnam, and being at one time Vice-President of the
Society for the Reform of the Abortion Law, Chairman of the Campaign
Against Racial Discrimination in Sport, and President of the
Homosexual Law Reform Society. His support for the decriminalization
of homosexual behavior, he once quipped, could not be thought by
anyone acquainted with him to involve a vested interest. Ayer&rsquo;s
support for the Labour Party came to an end with the formation of the
Social Democratic Party in 1981. His support for the SDP was a protest
at the leftward trend of the Labour Party, and particularly its
anti-Europeanism.</p>

<p>
The arrangement of spending long weekends in London and some of the
working week in Oxford added to Ayer&rsquo;s turbulent domestic life.
In 1963 he and Dee Wells had a son, Nicholas, of whom Ayer said,
&ldquo;My love for this child has been a dominating factor in the
remainder of my life&rdquo; (Rogers 1999, 278.) He formed a
relationship with Vanessa Lawson, whom he would see whilst in Oxford.
During this time, Ayer continued to be philosophically productive,
doing some of his most original work. <em>The Origins of
Pragmatism</em> was published in 1968, following this <em>Russell and
Moore: the Analytical Heritage</em> (the product of the William James
lectures he delivered at Harvard in 1970), and <em>Probability and
Evidence</em> (the Dewey lectures delivered at Columbia University in
1970). Shortly thereafter came <em>Russell</em>, a small paperback,
and <em>The Central Questions of Philosophy</em> (1973, originally
given as the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews), in
which he elaborated on the sophisticated realism first put forward in
<em>The Origins of Pragmatism.</em> He visited Canada on a couple of
occasions, giving the Gilbert Ryle lectures at Trent University (1979)
resulting in his book on Hume, and the Whidden lectures at McMaster
(1983) giving rise to <em>Freedom and Morality</em>.</p>

<p>
Shortly after being divorced from Dee Wells, Ayer married Vanessa
Lawson in 1982. Shortly before that Renee, his first wife, had died
(1980), followed by Valerie, their daughter, who died suddenly of
Hodgkin&rsquo;s disease in 1981. Tragically Vanessa was to die of
liver cancer in 1985, leaving Ayer grief-stricken. He himself had a
close encounter with death, being &lsquo;technically&rsquo; dead for a
few minutes after choking on a piece of smoked salmon. On reviving he
reported his experience whilst &lsquo;dead&rsquo; in such a way as to
provide fodder for those who thought the famous atheist had recanted
and found God. He moved quickly to dispel these rumours. By this time
he had become something of a philosophical Grand Old Man, with volumes
published in his honour, and a full-length critical study by John
Foster in the prestigious Routledge &ldquo;arguments of the
philosophers&rdquo; series. He spent most of the remaining couple of
years responding to articles that were to appear in the Ayer volume in
the Library of Living Philosophers series, edited by L.E. Hahn. He
remarried Dee Wells, but not long afterwards Ayer was admitted to
hospital with a collapsed lung in the early summer of 1989 and died on
the 27<sup>th</sup>, June.</p>

<p>
Ayer wrote two autobiographies, <em>Part of My Life</em>, and <em>More
of My Life</em>. His circle of friends included many famous and
influential people; the following (in no particular order) is only a
brief list. Cyril Connolly, Graham Greene, George Orwell, ee cummings
and his wife Marianne, Meyer Schapiro, Arthur Koestler, Bertrand
Russell, Stephen Spender, W.H. Auden, Philip Toynbee, Isaiah Berlin,
Hugh Gaitskell, Roy Jenkins, Michael Foot, Richard Crossman, Jonathan
Miller, Angus Wilson, Alan Bennett, Alice Thomas Ellis, Joan Fontaine,
Iris Murdoch, V.S. Pritchett, and Christopher Hitchens. He believed,
maybe truly, that the character of George Moore in Tom
Stoppard&rsquo;s play <em>Jumpers</em> was modeled on him. Ayer was a
vain man whose vanity was part of his considerable charm. He made a
distinction between vanity and egotism; an egotist, he said, thought
he should have more medals, whilst a vain person just enjoyed showing
off the medals he had. Among the many &lsquo;medals&rsquo; given to
Ayer were his knighthood, Fellow of the British Academy, honorary
member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Member of the
Bulgarian Order of Cyril and Methodius, 1<sup>st</sup> class, and
Chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;honneur.</p>

<h2 id="FunNatPhi">2. The Function and Nature of Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="PhiAna">2.1. Philosophical Analysis</h3>

<p>
In <em>LTL</em>, Ayer defines the task of philosophy as
critical-linguistic analysis of scientific and common-sense
statements. He dismissed such traditional conceptions that view the
propositions of philosophy as first principles, or conceived
philosophy&rsquo;s task as vindicating scientific statements
(<em>LTL</em>, pp. 46&ndash;50). What remained for him is that the
propositions of philosophy &ldquo;are not factual, but linguistic in
character&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em>, p. 57). That does not mean, however,
that philosophy is about the everyday usage of words (as in certain
forms of the emerging ordinary language philosophy, see Chapman 2021
and Parker-Ryan 2021 for comparisons), because the propositions of
philosophy would be empirical in character then (like linguistics,
sociology, or anthropology), but Ayer wanted to differentiate
philosophy from the sciences. Rather, philosophy is concerned with
classes or types of expressions (like definitions) and thus it is
clarificatory on a more abstract level, dealing, for example, with the
formal consequnces of defitions and their inter-linguistic relations
(<em>LTL</em>, p. 26).</p>

<p>
To give an example, Ayer uses Russell&rsquo;s theory of descriptions
 (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/#RussTheoDefiDesc">see the SEP entry on that</a>).
 It illustrates how one can define a certain symbol by translating the
sentence which contains it into an equivalent sentence that contains
neither the term in questions, nor any of its synonyms (<em>LTL</em>,
p. 60). Following Russell, Ayer shows that the relevant term is in
fact a description and not a referential phrase as it was initially
thought, thus philosophy reveals a <em>hidden logical structure</em>.
Philosophy starts with certain known and common expressions, reveals
their structure and logical features, and hence therapeutically
dismisses the relevant and associated philosophical problems through a
logico-linguistic analysis. For the early Ayer, philosophy was seen
explicitly as &ldquo;a department of logic&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em>, p. 57).</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, <em>LTL</em> does not contain much about logic <em>per
se</em>. When Ayer was in Vienna, he wrote to Ryle that &ldquo;the
problems of pure logistic do not interest me very much&rdquo;
(Harr&eacute; and Shosky 1999, p. 32). Concrete logical formalism does
not play much role in solving philosophical problems in <em>LTL</em>,
just as metalogical axiomatizations, ideally constructed first order
languages, or syntactical derivations are largely absent from
Ayer&rsquo;s work. Although he ended <em>LTL</em> by stating that
philosophy has to become the logic of science (<em>LTL</em>, p. 153),
the book does not contain anything like that in the style and fashion
of Carnap (not even references to his <em>Logische Syntax der
Sprache</em>) but pursues a general linguistic analysis that loosely
draws from Carnap and Schlick-Wittgenstein alike.</p>

<p>
Later, in 1973, Ayer defined philosophy, very much in line with
<em>LTL</em>, as a field that is concerned with many subjects (like
ethics, knowledge, logic), but in all cases, it deals with criteria,
standards, assessments, and methods (1973, p. 2) and not with concrete
empirical data or observations. In that sense, philosophy functions
rather as some sort of meta-discipline that has a general view of its
many subjects, and investigates those abstract categories, concepts,
and frameworks that are used in first-order inquiries and
&ldquo;dominate all our thinking&rdquo; (1962, p. 19).</p>

<h3 id="PhiSci">2.2. Philosophy and Science</h3>

<p>
Regarding science and its relation to philosophy, Ayer (1977, p. 163)
admitted later that he &ldquo;had little skill in mathematics and no
scientific training&rdquo;. Although <em>LTL</em> does not contain
anything about the traditional debates surrounding the foundations of
mathematics (just a general discussion about the analytic character of
mathematical and logical propositions), Ayer&rsquo;s lack of
scientific knowledge was even more substantial and manifest given the
line of argumentation of <em>LTL</em> that pointed in the equation of
philosophy with the logic of <em>science</em>.</p>

<p>
For Ayer, science had speculative and logical parts, where the former
was pursued by the scientists who formulated hypotheses and guesses,
and the latter (the investigation of the <em>logical</em> relations
between these hypotheses, and the logical definition of the symbols
involved) was the object of philosophizing. The &ldquo;essential&rdquo; assumption
here was that the inquirer or analyzer had to &ldquo;understand science&rdquo; to
properly accomplish the logical task, and thus for the philosophers
who do the logic of science and analyze scientific symbols &ldquo;it
is necessary to become scientist[s]&rdquo; if their aim is to
contribute to the growth of human knowledge (<em>LTL</em>, p. 153).
Most logical empiricists, having substantial training or even degrees
in natural science, did not have any problem with that.
Electromagnetic theory, relativity theory, quantum mechanics and
optics were in the focus of their investigations, along with highly
advanced mathematics. Since Ayer argued in <em>LTL</em> that one
cannot be a good philosopher without understanding the propositions of
science (later he even said that &ldquo;if anything is to be achieved
in the philosophy of physics, it must come from the inside&rdquo;,
1962, p. 15), he tried to mature in the natural sciences with the help
of his friend, J. L. Austin (see Rogers 1999, p. 130), but he quickly
ended that project and continued to do research in his favorite topic,
namely epistemology.</p>

<p>
Although <em>LTL</em> itself, for which Ayer is most well-known among
Anglophone philosophers, hardly contains radically new insights and
developments in logic, philosophy of mathematics and science <em>per
se</em> &ndash; things for which the Vienna Circle is known as
revolutionary &ndash; Ayer&rsquo;s oeuvre, as we shall see below,
contains important details and considerations that earned him a
leading place in the history of analytic philosophy (about that see
Quinton 1991, and the studies in Tuboly 2021a, especially Vrahimis
2021).</p>

<h3 id="PhiMet">2.3. Philosophy and Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
If logical positivism is known for one thesis, then it is the
rejection of metaphysics as literally and cognitively meaningless (see
Carnap 1932/1959, and Section 3.1 of the entry on the
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/#VerCriMetClaPer">Vienna Circle</a>).
 Following the Vienna Circle, Ayer also developed distinct
anti-metaphysical views, for which, as he stated in a letter to Otto
Neurath in 1935, he was &ldquo;made to suffer economically&rdquo;
because &ldquo;at Oxford &hellip; metaphysics still
predominates&rdquo; (quoted in Tuboly 2021b, p. 4, n. 3). Ayer tried
to &ldquo;demonstrate the impossibility of metaphysics&rdquo; already
in 1934 and by following Carnap, he argued that statements of
metaphysicians are not uncertain, arbitrary, or unclear, but entirely
nonsensical, stemming from linguistic or grammatical mistakes and
emotional extrapolations (Ayer 1934a, 342). Although a series of
critical discussions developed from this paper (see C. A. Mace 1934a,
1934b, Ayer 1934b replying), his views did not change much in
<em>LTL</em> where Ayer tried to &ldquo;eliminate metaphysics&rdquo;.
Utilising his &ldquo;criterion of verification&rdquo;, he went on to
argue that only verifiable, that is, empirical propositions are
meaningful (see below Section 3.1.), and since metaphysical statements
purports to describe a non-empirical realm, they cannot be verified
neither practically, nor in principle, thus they lack cognitive
meaning (<em>LTL</em>, p. 37).</p>

<p>
At this point, Ayer did not use or rely on Carnap&rsquo;s positive
story about metaphysics (see, for example, Damb&ouml;ck 2024), namely
that even if metaphysical statements lacks cognitive meaning, that is,
they do not express truth-apt empirical propositions, they still have
an important existential function by expressing our attitude towards
life. This view of metaphysics was taken by Carnap mainly from Wilhelm
Dilthey and Friedrich Nietzsche, thus from continental sources sources
that were mainly either unknown or seemingly unimportant for
Ayer&rsquo;s whose Anglophone sources and problems were often in
contrasts to Carnap&rsquo;s original German-speaking cultural and
scholarly environment (on thatsee Vrahimis 2021). Furthermore, the
more positive and practical approach to metaphysics resonated well
with certain pragmatist ideas about the usage of concepts, language
and theories and how they relate to social matters, which was
recognised later both by Carnap and by another prominent logical
empiricist, Philipp Frank (2021, p. 271) who provided a Dewey-inspired
behaviorized account of Carnap&rsquo;s critique of metaphysics. As
soon as Ayer got involved more and more with traditional pragmatism,
he also started to develop his similar, more positive account of
metaphysics, especially in philosophy of science and meaning.</p>

<p>
Ayer took his clue from C. S. Peirce (about the importance of use in
meaning, see Ayer 1968) and more directly from one of the last papers
of Frank Ramsey, &ldquo;Theories&rdquo;, in which Ramsey (1929/1965,
pp. 212&ndash;214) differentiated the &ldquo;primary system&rdquo;
(corresponding mainly to the observational language of a theory) from
the &ldquo;secondary system&rdquo; (which is the non-observable, or
theoretical language). The first one is related by Ayer to the factual
content of theories, developed out of primitive data of perception,
the heritage of common sense. The primary system consist of
descriptions of physical things that are identified with series of
events, which constitute their histories: &ldquo;such and such
observable properties are located at such and such particular places
at such and such particular times&rdquo; (1973, p. 142). These were
supposed to register facts of the matter, hopefully in an atomistic
manner (coming from his Humeanism).</p>

<p>
But there were various problems with a simplistic atomist conception
of facts, entirely graspable within a primary system that is sharply
distinguishable from the secondary system. Ayer accepted (in fact,
already in <em>LTL</em>, pp. 38&ndash;39; cf. Glock 2021, pp.
267&ndash;268) that a theory has to be tested as a whole and &ldquo;we
may have latitude in deciding which parts of it there is need to
revise&rdquo; (Ayer 1973, p. 29). Because of that, a theory as a whole
answers to experience and it becomes hard to decide which part of it
is purely formal and which have factual content. Furthermore, by
referring to Hempel&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Theoretician&rsquo;s
Dilemma&rdquo; (1958), Ayer argues that quantitative concepts of
science cannot be defined &ldquo;in terms of what is actually
observable&rdquo; (1973, p. 32), and thus experience and observation
cannot match the &lsquo;openness&rsquo; of the texture of scientific
theories. From a more general linguistic point of view, Ayer gave some
credit to the view that &ldquo;we take at least as much interest in
the way things come into being and in the uses to which we can put
them as we do in the perceptible properties by which they are
immediately recognized&rdquo;, (1973, p. 141), that is, our concepts
of things are implicitly related to different concepts, like that of
&ldquo;being an oak&rdquo; to &ldquo;sprung from acorn&rdquo;, that
is, even statements of facts <em>seem</em> to point beyond themselves.
Although he provided a detailed criticism of this view (by saying that
what happens in such cases is that we build a causal generalisation
&ndash; that oaks stem from acorns &ndash; into the definition of the
term and try to secure it that way, see 1973, p. 141), he conceived
more positively a similar issue in a different context. Statements of
causation, writes Ayer, are partially dispositional because they cover
not just actual, but also possible correlations, by saying that under
these and these circumstances (independently whether they are actually
happening now or not), such and such a event will happen. Thus, causal
statements always involve some kind of generalisation (not necessarily
a law, but a regulation, to save Hume&rsquo;s insights), like
&ldquo;one event would not occur unless another event stood in such
and such a spatio-temporal relation to it&rdquo; (1973, p. 144). But
because of these considerations, the primary system, or the observable
language, is not just way too austere, but conceived facts too
narrowly.</p>

<p>
Beyond the &ldquo;primary system&rdquo; is the &ldquo;secondary
system&rdquo; that &ldquo;legislates for possible as well as actual
cases and can also contain terms which are not directly related to
anything observable&rdquo; (1973, p. 33; Ayer refers here back to
Peirce and compares the secondary system to what Peirce&rsquo;s ideal
of &ldquo;the arrangement of facts&rdquo;). While primary systems register facts
and contains thus only factual propositions, secondary systems could
be extended to cover possible and fictitious cases as well. Their
function is thus &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; and their goal is to
arrange primary facts as conceptual tools (1973, pp. 109&ndash;110).
As Ayer put the point in a related paper, facts of the world
(described in the primary system) could be arranged and make sense in
different &ldquo;conceptual systems&rdquo;. He used Ludwig
Wittgenstein and Arthur Eddington&rsquo;s simile, &ldquo;we spread the
net, but we have to wait and see what it catches&rdquo; (1962, p. 19).
With different nets (secondary systems), different facts can be
grasped (in the primary system), and it is philosophy&rsquo;s task to
deal with these secondary systems (see Section 2.1. above). Because of
that, Ayer became more permissive with metaphysics, itself a
conceptual system, and argued that &ldquo;we are, I think, entitled to
require of any metaphysical theory that it should function as a
secondary system, at least to the extent of having some explanatory
value&rdquo; (1973, p. 33). Metaphysics could thus serve as a tool to
arrange facts and reshape experience and our relation to the world.
Since the boundaries between primary and secondary systems seem to be
arbitrary and our actual primary system was &ldquo;itself the product
of theory&rdquo; (1973, p. 144), philosophy, and with it metaphysics
too, can &ldquo;formally&rdquo; change the world &ldquo;by
refashioning the structure of language. In this way it may help to
determine what facts there can be&rdquo; (1962, p. 19). (On
Ayer&rsquo;s changing attitude towards metaphysics see K&ouml;rner
(1979), to which Ayer (1979, ) replied, to which K&ouml;rner (1991)
also replied in more details.)</p>

<h2 id="MeaTru">3. Meaning and Truth</h2>

<h3 id="Mea">3.1 Meaning</h3>

<p>
The empiricist basis of Ayer&rsquo;s attitude to meaning was laid
first in his reading of Hume. The thought that no idea had any
empirical significance unless it was suitably related to an impression
stayed with him, and was reinforced both by his reading of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em> and by the time spent in
Vienna with the Logical Positivists. His first formulation of a
criterion of meaning, the principle of verification, was in the first
edition of <em>LTL</em> (1936)<em>,</em> where he claimed that all
propositions were analytic (true in virtue of their meaning) or else
either strongly verifiable or weakly verifiable (a different
reconstruction of Ayer&rsquo;s view of analyticity and a defence
against some of its critics are presented in Rathgeb 2021). Strong
verification required that the truth of a proposition be conclusively
ascertainable; weak verification required only that an observation
statement be deducible from the proposition together with other,
auxiliary, propositions, provided that the observation statement was
not deducible from these auxiliaries alone. This rapidly proved
defective: any proposition <em>P</em> conjoined with &lsquo;if
<em>P</em> then <em>O</em>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<em>O</em>&rsquo; is
an observation statement, will yield <em>O</em>, without this being
deducible from &lsquo;if <em>P</em> then <em>O</em>&rsquo; alone. So
in the second edition Ayer amended the principle to read: a statement
is directly verifiable if it is either an observation statement or is
such that an observation statement is derivable from it in conjunction
with another observation statement (or observation statements), such
derivability not being possible from the conjoined observation
statement(s) alone. And a statement is indirectly verifiable if,
first, in conjunction with certain other premises it entails one or
more directly verifiable statements that are not derivable from these
other premises alone, and, second, that these other premises &ldquo;do
not include any statement that is not either analytic, or directly
verifiable, or capable of being independently established as
indirectly verifiable.&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em> 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. P.
17).</p>

<p>
This principle generated further criticism, most significantly from
Alonzo Church (1949), who claimed to show that, again, it allowed
<em>any</em> statement to be meaningful. Take <em>O</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>O</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>O</em><sub>3</sub> as logically
independent observation statements, and <em>S</em> any statement
whatsoever. Then</p>

<p>
(1) (&not;<em>O</em><sub>1</sub>&amp;<em>O</em><sub>2</sub>) v
(<em>O</em><sub>3</sub>&amp;&not;<em>S</em>)</p>

<p>
is directly verifiable, as (1) in conjunction with
<em>O</em><sub>1</sub> entails <em>O</em><sub>3</sub>. <em>S</em>
becomes indirectly verifiable, as <em>O</em><sub>2</sub> follows from
<em>S</em> and (1), and (1) is directly verifiable. Should
<em>O</em><sub>2</sub> follow from (1) alone, then
<em>O</em><sub>2</sub> follows from
<em>O</em><sub>3</sub>&amp;&not;<em>S</em>, which means that
&not;<em>S</em> is directly verifiable (<em>O</em><sub>2</sub> and
<em>O</em><sub>3</sub>&amp;&not;<em>S</em> being logically
independent).</p>

<p>
Despite the failure of these attempts to provide a rigorous empiricist
criterion of meaning, Ayer continued to hold that there was a close
connection between evidence and meaning, maintaining that a
satisfactory account of confirmation was needed before a fool-proof
criterion of empirical meaning could be supplied. Given later doubts
about whether any theory of confirmation could provide a foundation
for a theory of meaning (Quinean doubts relating to the impossibility
of ruling out any facts as possibly bearing on the truth of any
sentence), it remains unclear as to how the evidence-meaning
connection can be circumscribed. (For a review of other attacks on,
and adjustments to, the verification principle, see Wright 1986, 1989;
for a recent evaluation, see Glock 2021.)</p>

<p>
In addition to the technical difficulties surrounding the proper
formulation of the meaning-criterion, Ayer later acknowledged that he
had been vague as to whether the criterion was intended in a
&lsquo;weak&rsquo; or &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sense: if weak,
verifiability merely demarcated sense from nonsense, whilst the strong
version meant that the method of verification provided the meaning of
the sentence. It was the strong version that was used in his
discussion of the meaning of sentences about the past and other minds,
but in his discussion of the latter another difficulty emerged. It had
not been made clear whether the &lsquo;method of verification&rsquo;
was intended to be neutral between people employing the sentences in
question, and so provide a standard meaning for these sentences, or
whether such a method could provide an idiosyncratic meaning for one
individual&rsquo;s use of the sentence, the method of verification
being peculiar to that person. In his discussion of mental
experiences, Ayer had implicitly taken the second route, and so
sentences attributing such experiences to himself were given a
&lsquo;mentalistic&rsquo; analysis, and those attributing experiences
to others were given a behaviorist analysis in terms of their
empirical manifestations, namely with reference to their overt
behavior (see the introduction to the second edition of <em>LTL</em>,
and also the work of Uebel (2021) who shows not just how Ayer&rsquo;s
position has changed about the various arguments about the existence
of other minds and the mental-state attribution to others, especially
the so-called argument from analogy, but also how Ayer&rsquo;s own
philosophical estimation between his various works evolved and got
scrutinized). At the same time, however, he construed another&rsquo;s
self-attribution of experience mentalistically, whereas, as he later
acknowledged, to be consistent these should also have been given a
behaviorist analysis (see the discussion between Bernard Williams and
Ayer in Macdonald 1979; for a general reconstruction of Ayer&rsquo;s
philosophy of the mind-body problem, see Ambrus 2021).</p>

<p>
The strong interpretation of the criterion required there to be some
decision made as to what evidence contributed to the meaning of
verifiable sentences. For Ayer it was clear that not all evidence for
a statement was to be included in the meaning of the statement: a
statement about the blood on Jack&rsquo;s jacket was not included in
the meaning of the assertion that Jack was the murderer. Further,
although only present evidence is available to anybody making a
statement about the past, the meaning of such a statement is not
restricted to such present evidence; one is entitled to include in the
meaning evidence that would be available if one were able to transport
oneself to that past time. Moral statements were, in Ayer&rsquo;s
view, not verifiable, and so could not be construed as assertions of
fact, being interpreted instead as expressions of emotion. This is
examined again in Section 8.</p>

<p>
The only class of statements that Ayer allowed to be meaningful
without such a connection to evidence was that comprised of
tautologies, which included all analytic propositions. These were the
only propositions knowable <em>a priori</em>, their meaning being
dependent on how language was used, and on the conventions governing
that use. Ayer insisted that the necessity attaching to these
propositions was only available once the conventions governing
language-use were in play.</p>

<h3 id="Tru">3.2 Truth</h3>

<p>
When discussing the problem of truth, Ayer distinguished between two
fundamental questions &ndash; &ldquo;What is truth&rdquo; could be
read as &ldquo;What is <em>truth?</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>What</em>
is truth?&rdquo;. In the first case, we deal with the definition of
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; and discuss that common property that is shared by
all true entities. This is a definitional project about the nature and
character of truth. In the second case, however, we have to clarify
what or which entities &ndash; mostly proposition, statements, or
sentences &ndash; are true (and are false). This question concerns
that criterion, or in certain cases, the criteria of truth. As Kocsis
(2021) has shown, Ayer (1935) was very much aware of this distinction
that was formulated back then by two of his philosophical heroes,
Bertrand Russell (1910, pp. 172&ndash;173) and Frank Ramsey
(1927&ndash;29/1990, p. 6).</p>

<p>
In <em>LTL</em> Ayer, following Ramsey (as he thought, but see Field
1986 for a dissenting view), put forward a redundancy (deflationary)
view of truth: &ldquo;&hellip;in all sentences of the form
&lsquo;<em>p</em> is true&rsquo;, the phrase &lsquo;is true&rsquo; is
logically superfluous&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em> p. 117). The function of
such a phrase is simply to mark an assertion (or denial, in the case
of &lsquo;is false&rsquo;), so there is no &lsquo;real&rsquo; relation
of truth, and so no problem of truth for philosophers to worry about.
Similarly, when we say a proposition is probable, or probably true, we
are not assigning any intrinsic property to the proposition, nor
saying that there is any relation it bears to any other proposition.
We are simply expressing our confidence in that proposition, or, more
accurately, it expresses the degree of confidence it is rational to
possess in the proposition. Note, however, that after <em>LTL</em>,
Ayer (1992) realized the need for a less radical and more
sophisticated deflationary view about the nature of truth,
&ldquo;admitting that in exceptional cases, the usage of the truth
predicate is unavoidable&rdquo; (Kocsis 2021, p. 290).</p>

<p>
About the criterion of which statements are true, Ayer held a more
substantial view. He formulated his approach within the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s famous protocol-sentence debate (Uebel 2007), where the
two basic position about the criterion might be labelled &ldquo;coherentism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;correspondism&rdquo;. According to coherentism (defended by Carl G.
Hempel and Otto Neurath), protocol sentences cannot be compared with
reality, and their truth consists in being members of a coherent
system of propositions. Correspondists, like Moritz Schlick, thought
consistency itself cannot furnish a sufficiently strong criterion
(fairy tales, for example, can be consistent too), and the criterion
of truth lies in a protocol sentence&rsquo;s <em>agreement</em> with
empirical reality. Ayer sided with the correspondists in arguing that
the criterion of truth in empirical matters is the comparison of the
given statement with empirical reality. Because of that, Ayer denied
that moral utterances were truth-apt. Given that he thought that
asserting that <em>p</em> was equivalent to saying that <em>p</em> was
true, and that there should be a strong agreement between a statement
and its empirical correspondent, he had to deny that moral utterances
could be assertions (see section 8).</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, Ayer was &ldquo;a false friend to Schlick&rdquo; (Kocsis
2021, p. 297) because he argued that &ldquo;there are no final
proposition&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em>, p. 94), contrary to Schlick&rsquo;s
views, and all our empirical propositions are just hypothetical and
revisable through and through (just as Neurath thought). By comparing
propositions with reality, we are aiming at truth by formulating
predictions about future experiences that could be fulfilled and thus
nominated as truths. &ldquo;The main difference between Ayer and
Schlick,&rdquo; argues Kocsis (2021, p. 299), &ldquo;is that Ayer
pursued and provided an authorizing criterion, while Schlick aimed at
a guaranteeing criterion of truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
This deflationary attitude to truth was supported by his
verificationism about meaning; Ayer did not have to provide
truth-conditions for the meaning of sentences. Assertions had meaning
in virtue of their verification conditions, and propositions were
defined just as an equivalence class of sentences with the same
verification conditions.</p>

<p>
See the entry on
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/">the deflationary theory of truth</a>
 for further discussion.</p>

<h2 id="Per">4. Perception</h2>

<p>
In his early work on perception Ayer espoused a strict form of
phenomenalism, defending the view that statements about material
objects are translatable into statements about actual and possible
&lsquo;sense-contents&rsquo;. These latter statements were the
ultimate verifiers, forming the basis upon which our empirical world
was constructed. Although he later abandoned the reductionism inherent
in the translatability requirement (beginning with
&ldquo;Phenomenalism&rdquo; in 1947), believing that he had been wrong
to think that any statement about a physical object could be entailed
by a set of statements about sensory experience (sense-data), Ayer
continued to hold that our claims about physical objects were
justified by reference to such sensory experience. He consistently
opposed the view, espoused by Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and Karl
Popper, that the only justifiers were sentences, whether
Neurath&rsquo;s &lsquo;protocols&rsquo; or Popper&rsquo;s &lsquo;basic
statements&rsquo;. His criticism of such views was that the favoured
class of statements could not be picked out in the right way without
an appeal to relevant experience. So a criterion for membership of the
favored class of statements that required only those statements
accepted by the scientists of the time to be members of the class was
not going to be successful without knowing which sentences were thus
accepted, and this, Ayer claimed, could only be known by experience.
The alternative of using yet another sentence, one stating that these
(<em>p</em>,<em>q</em>,<em>r</em>, &hellip;) were the sentences in the
relevant class (those accepted by the scientists), would make the
foundations of science entirely arbitrary.</p>

<p>
Even on Ayer&rsquo;s later view, called &lsquo;sophisticated
realism&rsquo;(in Ayer 1973), where our perception of physical objects
was indirect, the ultimate bases for perceptual judgments were
sense-data, which were now called &lsquo;qualia&rsquo; (or, if
particularized, &lsquo;percepts&rsquo;). It was this continuing
commitment to sense-data as the objects of perception that drew J.L.
Austin&rsquo;s (often sarcastic) criticism in <em>Sense and
Sensibilia</em> (1962). On Ayer&rsquo;s view, qualia formed the
patterns constituting a primary system, and it was on the basis of
this system that we posited the existence of physical objects, this
being the &lsquo;theoretical&rsquo; secondary system. Once we have
this theory, we are able reinterpret the quale as mental states and
claim that they are caused by the physical objects. This causal claim
is only merited once the theoretical system is in place, and so cannot
be a primitive element in any account of perception. The physical
objects are required to be there before any causal hypothesis
involving them makes sense.</p>

<p>
Part, but only a part, of Ayer&rsquo;s reason for embracing such
indirect realism was what has been called the argument from illusion,
the central idea of which is that, for any perceptual state of ours,
we could be in a state indiscriminable from it but which did not
involve perception of any material object or scene, it being an
illusion that there was any such object or scene to be perceived. That
is, non-veridical perceptions could share their intrinsic properties
with veridical perceptions, this possibility leading Ayer to claim
that it was plausible that the object of perception in both cases was
(non-material) experience, and not, as na&iuml;ve realism would have
it, the physical objects themselves. As a consequence, ordinary
perceptual judgments, those making claims about such objects, go
beyond what is &lsquo;strictly available&rsquo; in our perceptual
experience, and so they form a theory about that which is available to
perception.</p>

<p>
There are many ways of querying Ayer&rsquo;s conclusion. Austin
attacked the way he saw the argument from illusion being deployed. He
questioned just about everything in it: the distinction between
veridical and non-veridical perception, the supposed generalization
from &lsquo;some (real) perceptual experience is indiscriminable from
a (mere) perceptual appearance&rsquo; to &lsquo;all such perceptions
are indiscriminable from their counterpart appearances&rsquo;, and the
assumption that when we have defective perceptions there are
non-material objects of those perceptions, sense-data.</p>

<p>
Strawson (1979) argued that the primary system, that purporting to
describe no more than what was &lsquo;strictly available&rsquo; to
perception, could only be described using concepts available to those
already acquainted with the secondary system. A consequence of this,
he claimed, was that the secondary system embodied in ordinary
perceptual judgments could not be a theory with respect to which the
primary system was the data &ndash; the data have to be describable in
terms that do not presuppose the very theory for which they are the
data. Although, he argued, it may be possible, though difficult, for
us to strip our vocabulary describing our experience of such
secondary-system concepts, such an effort on our part would be
unusual, and not at all like what is involved in our common-sense
perceptual judgments, those that Ayer supposes to be the result of
some theorizing on our part. For Strawson, our commitment to a
conceptual scheme of a realist character is &lsquo;something given
with the given&rsquo; (Strawson 1979, p. 47).</p>

<p>
Ayer was unmoved by the objections. He replied to Austin&rsquo;s
attack in &ldquo;Has Austin Refuted Sense-data Theory&rdquo; (Ayer
1967), with Ayer defending the viability of the distinction between
veridical and non-veridical perception, and maintaining that the
argument from illusion was only one source of the case for sense-data.
(For an in-depth discussion of the dispute between Austin and Ayer,
see Mike Thau, &ldquo;What is Disjunctivism&rdquo; 2004). Against
Strawson (&ldquo;Replies&rdquo; 1979) he noted that there was
considerable agreement between them: in particular, they both agreed
that perceptual judgments contain implications going beyond those
carried by a &lsquo;strict&rsquo; account of our sensible experience.
The disagreement was primarily about whether the perceptual judgments
were based on, or were inferred from, awareness of sense-data. Ayer
conceded that such an inference would be only implicit. The point
about language he conceded as well, maintaining only that the
assumptions often built into concepts descriptive of physical objects
&ndash; the accessibility of such objects to other observers, that
they continued to exist unperceived, and so on, would not be in play
when these concepts were used to provide the &lsquo;strict&rsquo;
account of perceptual experience.</p>

<h2 id="IndPro">5. Induction and Probability</h2>

<p>
Hume was an influential figure in the formation of Ayer&rsquo;s
philosophical views, so it is no surprise to find Ayer&rsquo;s
approach to inductive inference modeled on Hume&rsquo;s. Ayer defined
inductive inference in negative terms, as involving all factual
inference in which the premises did not entail the conclusion. All
such inferences, Ayer claimed, presumed the uniformity of nature, an
assumption he put in terms of assuming that the future will, in
relevant respects, resemble the past (1956, p. 72). To unambiguously
cover cases of retrodiction, the assumption is better put in terms of
the unobserved resembling, in relevant respects, the observed. Ayer
agreed with Hume that relying on any &lsquo;principle&rsquo; of the
uniformity of nature was not going to help justify inductive
inference, given that such a principle was itself not demonstrable. A
similar argument applied to any other principles that may have been
thought to supply the missing ingredient, such as an appeal to
universal causality, or to laws of nature. These were also not
demonstrably true, so would require justification themselves, and any
appeal to these principles in such a justification would be viciously
circular.</p>

<p>
The fundamental problem here is that the inductive gap can be closed
only if the premises can somehow be made to entail their conclusion,
and Ayer denied that this could be done. Na&iuml;ve realism tried to
do it by making the evidence &lsquo;move up&rsquo; to the conclusion
&ndash; by making it the case that in perception our evidence was
directly of physical objects, rather than of sense-data from which
physical objects were inferred. This could work, if it did, only for
perception, and not for other inductive inferences. Reductive attempts
to close the gap tried to make the conclusion &lsquo;move down&rsquo;
to the premises, as in phenomenalism. Ayer by now thought
phenomenalism was unsuccessful in this attempt, and again reductionism
would not work for the future cases. In his 1956 he thought that the
best we could do was to admit the gap and be content to describe the
ways in which we actually went about justifying such inferences.</p>

<p>
Ayer went on in later work to examine the problem of induction in
greater detail, in particular in relation to attempts to make the
problem tractable by appeal to notions of probability. In 1957 he
wrote an important article attacking the idea that the logical
conception of probability could be a useful guide to the future. Given
a proposition, <em>a</em>, that a horse is going to win the race, and
various sources of evidence, <em>h</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>h</em><sub>2</sub>,
<em>h</em><sub>3</sub>&hellip;<em>h</em><sub>n</sub>, one can estimate
the probability of <em>a</em> given <em>h</em><sub>1</sub> to be
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, given <em>h</em><sub>2</sub> to be
<em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, and so on. One can also estimate the
probability of <em>a</em> given all of <em>h</em><sub>1</sub>
&hellip;<em>h</em><sub>n</sub>. Call this probability
<em>p</em><sub>n</sub>, it being the probability of <em>a</em> given
all of the evidence available to the person wishing to place a bet on
the horse. Which of these probabilities, asks Ayer, would it be
rational for this person to base their bets on? Common sense dictates
that <em>p</em><sub>n</sub> is the best estimate, but Ayer argues that
on the logical conception of probability, all of the estimates
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>&hellip;<em>p</em><sub>n</sub> are logically
true, and so it is impossible to single out one as being
&lsquo;better&rsquo; than any of the others.</p>

<p>
Ayer notes that common sense (and Carnap) say that a probability based
on &lsquo;total&rsquo; evidence is what is needed. But why do we have
to take into account total evidence? Given that all of the different
estimates are logically true, there can be nothing wrong in relying on
one rather than another. Saying that if one takes into account all the
available evidence one is more likely to be right is equivalent to
saying that the hypothesis that &lsquo;those with total
evidence&rsquo; are more often right has a certain probability, and
that gets us no further forward. Ayer took this result as a reason to
reject the logical interpretation of probability statements, a
rejection repeated in his more extended treatment of probability in
<em>Probability and Evidence</em> 1972, and again in his reply to J.L.
Mackie&rsquo;s attempt to rebut his objections (see Mackie 1979, Ayer
1979).</p>

<p>
In <em>Probability and Evidence</em> Ayer also criticised the
frequency interpretation of probability, noting that under this
interpretation the probability of an event will change with any change
in the reference class to which that event is assigned. The frequency
interpretation itself cannot determine whether the choice of one
reference class over another is better for the determination of the
relevant probability, and so suffers from a critical defect if it is
to be of any use in solving problems associated with inductive
inference. (For further discussion of Ayer&rsquo;s views on
probability and induction see Bela Juhos 1969, and Foster 1985, pp.
198&ndash;227.)</p>

<h2 id="Kno">6. Knowledge</h2>

<p>
In <em>LTL</em>, Ayer was less concerned with the traditional
epistemological questions that came to dominate his thought in the
forthcoming years in such works as <em>The Foundations of Empirical
Knowledge</em> (1940) and <em>The Problem of Knowledge</em> (1956).
The most relevant parts of the early work concern the question of
certain and fallible knowledge in empirical matters. Ayer explicitly
rejects the idea (coming from Moritz Schlick and B&eacute;la Juhos of
the Vienna Circle) that there would be any empirical statement that is
absolutely certain and indisputable, like ostensive propositions that
purport to record direct perceptions or observations. Ayer thought
that empirical statements always contain descriptive and conceptual
elements (<em>LTL</em>, pp. 90&ndash;91), and thus they can&rsquo;t be
absolutely certain &ndash; there are no pure registrations of
one&rsquo;s experience. Because of that, every empirical proposition
is revisable as a hypothesis, and &ldquo;may be confirmed or
discredited in actual sense-experience&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em>, p.
94).</p>

<p>
Experience has the final world in our empirical knowledge (if one
states that experience can&rsquo;t refute a certain purportedly
empirical proposition <em>p</em>, then <em>p</em> is simply a
definition in disguise, see <em>LTL</em>, 95), and thus, anticipating
what later made famous by Quine, Ayer argued that &ldquo;the
&rsquo;facts of experience&rsquo; can never compel us to abandon a
hypothesis. A man can always sustain his convictions in the face of
apparently hostile evidence if he is prepared to make the necessary
adjustments hoc assumptions&rdquo; (<em>LTL</em>, p. 95). But the
details of how exactly one can handle empirical evidence, how norms
and reasons shape them, and how to counterweight various skeptical
strikes, Ayer had to engage more deeply with traditional epistemology.
By the mid-1930s, Carnap has just tried to convert epistemology into
pure logic of science (see Uebel 2018) but Ayer did not follow him,
thus he started to diverge from major concerns of (at least some
representative) logical positivists early on.</p>

<p>
In <em>The Problem of Knowledge</em> (1956), Ayer defended a
context-based account of knowledge that had as its essential
ingredients that some claim, <em>p</em>, counted as knowledge for a
person, <em>A</em>, <em>iff</em> <em>p</em> was true, A was sure that
<em>p</em>, and <em>A</em> had, in the relevant context, &lsquo;the
right to be sure&rsquo; about the truth of <em>p</em>. The contextual
element is apparent in the discussion after Ayer outlines what is
required to have the &lsquo;right to be sure&rsquo; in the
mathematical case. One avenue to knowledge in this case lies in the
ability of the agent to provide a proof of the relevant proposition.
In the case of perception, or memory, it is clear that it is
impossible to possess such a proof, so a more relaxed standard is
required. To state <em>in general</em> how strong the backing needs to
be for a believer to have the right to be sure that their belief is
true is not possible; doing so would require drawing up a list of
conditions &ldquo;under which perception, or memory, or testimony, or
other forms of evidence are reliable.&rdquo; (1956, p. 32.) Ayer
thought this would be too complicated a task, if at all possible. The
&lsquo;correct&rsquo; standard to set for claims to knowledge is to be
decided pragmatically, on grounds of practical convenience. The
skeptic&rsquo;s ploy of setting an impossible standard, one requiring
the impossibility of error, should be resisted, as one has the right
to be sure even where error is possible. (Ayer discussed such a
pragmatic view of vindication later in the context of scientific
theories too, when he wrote that &ldquo;we hold fast to our theories
because we find that they work, even though they do not satisfy the
sceptic&rsquo;s standards of proof&rdquo;, 1973, p. 137.)</p>

<p>
The account offered was intended as an analysis of knowledge, but
revealingly Ayer did not require that believers be aware of how they
have the right to be sure. It was allowed that somebody who invariably
correctly predicted the outcome of a lottery <em>could</em> be said to
know that their prediction was true, even though they, nor anyone
else, had any idea of how the predictions came to be reliable. Ayer
admitted that this case, and others like it, may cause some dispute:
it was not clearly covered by the meaning of the term
&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, and so left room for some stipulation.</p>

<p>
Ayer&rsquo;s particular analysis, or one closely resembling it, came
under attack in a famous paper by Gettier (1963), in which
satisfaction of the three clauses (the truth of <em>p</em>, the belief
in <em>p</em>, and the right to be sure that <em>p</em>) was held to
be insufficient for knowledge. Gettier&rsquo;s argument requires that
someone, <em>A</em>, could be justified in believing a false
proposition, and that if <em>A</em> was justified in believing
<em>p</em> and <em>q</em> is deducible from <em>p</em>, and <em>A</em>
accepted <em>q</em> by deducing it from <em>p</em>, then <em>A</em>
would be justified in believing <em>q</em>. An example used by Gettier
has the following structure: (i) Jones owns a Ford. (ii) Either Jones
owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston. Smith believes, and has ample
evidence for, (i). He deduces (ii) from (i), and so is justified in
believing (ii), even though, in fact, he has no idea of where Brown
is. It turns out that (i) is false, but (ii) is true &ndash;
unbeknownst to Smith, Brown is indeed in Boston. Gettier concluded
that in this case all three clauses of the analysis of knowledge are
satisfied, but that we should judge in this case that Smith did not
know (ii). The suggestion was that additional clauses might be
needed.</p>

<p>
The literature spawned by the Gettier counter-examples is huge, nearly
all of it attempting to pin down the elusive additional clause(s).
Ayer himself did not think that any such additional clauses were
needed. The counter-examples, he thought, showed that what was needed
was a more careful account of what &lsquo;being justified&rsquo;
consisted in. He disputed Gettier&rsquo;s claim that any deduction
from a justified, but false, proposition preserves justification. We
already knew, he claimed, that the notion of having evidence for a
claim is very difficult to elucidate; Carl Hempel&rsquo;s paradoxes
succeeded in showing that. Once we had managed to throw more light on
the justification relation, we would see that his proposed analysis
was sufficient for knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="NecCauFre">7. Necessity, Causality, and Freedom</h2>

<p>
We have seen that in <em>LTL</em> Ayer maintained that all necessary
truths were true in virtue of the meanings of the terms used in
expressing them, this in turn depending on the conventions governing
the use of those terms. One can see in the expression of this early
view unease about the source of logical necessity. He describes the
necessity of logical truths as dependent on the rules governing the
use of logical constants. Although such rules are neither true nor
false, they elucidate the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; use of such constants,
a formulation suggesting that the source of the necessity is deeper
than mere linguistic usage.</p>

<p>
Later, cleaving (or perhaps clinging) to his &ldquo;all necessity is
<em>de dicto</em>&rdquo; starting point, he consistently refused to
countenance any <em>de re</em> necessities. He strenuously resisted
the essentialism that became fashionable following the work of Putnam
and Kripke in the 1970s, but his reasons for doing so were not always
to the point. In his argument against essence-based <em>de re</em>
necessities Ayer would say that &ldquo;Caesar is necessarily
human&rdquo; is not true, since he could have called his dog
&ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;. Here he lost sight of his own insistence (in the
Introduction to the 2<sup>nd</sup>. Edition of <em>LTL)</em> that
necessary truths were expressed in a language whose terms had already
been assigned meaning and reference, so changing the reference of
&ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; is irrelevant to the necessary truth of a
sentence employing the term with its &lsquo;normal&rsquo;
reference.</p>

<p>
Of greater relevance was his suspicion of the move from conceivability
to possibility, and inconceivability to impossibility, thinking that
answers to questions about conceivability were dependent upon the
state of knowledge and imaginative powers of the person entertaining
them. Was it inconceivable that Caesar (the Julius of old) be
non-human? Ayer thought it consistent with everything he knew of
Caesar (apart from his being human) that Caesar was a robot, so he
could &ldquo;easily conceive of it as a possibility&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Replies&rdquo; p. 308). On the other hand, if asked whether
Caesar was a tortoise, he would suspect that the word
&ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; was here used with a different reference in mind.
Ayer buttressed this thought by suggesting that the descriptions
securing the referent of the term &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; would normally
make it logically inconsistent that the satisfier of the descriptions
be a tortoise, but that this did not establish <em>de re</em>
necessities; it does not follow that the Caesar in question
<em>necessarily</em> satisfies the descriptions associated with the
use of the name. To the suggestion that something other than
descriptions might secure the proper reference, such as the causal
origin of the use of the term, Ayer was dismissive: &ldquo;&hellip;the
idea &hellip;that one can explain the nature of reference by saying
that what makes <em>A</em>&rsquo;s use of a sign <em>s</em> a
reference to an object <em>O</em> is its causal derivation from
someone&rsquo;s original use of <em>s</em> to refer to <em>O</em> is a
manifest absurdity. If one does not understand what it is for
<em>s</em> to refer to <em>O</em>, one is none the wiser; and if one
does, the causal flummery is otiose.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Replies&rdquo;
1979 p. 309.)</p>

<p>
Ayer&rsquo;s rejection of these kind of <em>de re</em> necessities
was, at root, a consequence of his epistemological approach to their
evaluation. The senses of terms, he thought, were dependent on their
associated descriptions, these being dependent on what we knew of
their reference, and these senses accounted for the presence or
absence of necessity. So it is identity of sense in &ldquo;Hesperus is
Hesperus&rdquo; that makes that sentence necessarily true, whilst
absence of sense-identity renders &ldquo;Hesperus is
Phosphorous&rdquo; contingently true. He rejected the thought that
natural kind terms have their sense fixed by their internal
constitution on the grounds that many, if not most, users of natural
kind terms are ignorant of the nature of the relevant internal
constitutions. In this he is in agreement with those who recognize the
kind of necessity arising from primary intensions (Chalmers 2004) or
&lsquo;<em>A</em> intensions&rsquo; (Jackson 1998), such intensions
being determined by (some) phenomenal properties of the kinds referred
to.</p>

<p>
Ayer also repudiated causal necessity. Following Hume, he thought
causation could be reduced to regularity: &ldquo;<em>c</em> causes
<em>e</em>&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;whenever <em>c</em> then
<em>e</em>&rdquo;. This latter proposition is then a law of nature,
which is just a generalization to which we have a certain attitude. So
contingent generalizations and laws of nature are much the same; they
differ only in that we rely on the latter more than the former, and
are prepared to treat the law as though it possessed some stronger
modality, though in fact it does not.</p>

<p>
The lack of necessity attaching to causes made Ayer&rsquo;s acceptance
of human freedom undemanding. Having denied the existence of any
causal necessity it was open to Ayer to be a compatibilist:
determinism could be true (all action could be caused), but one could
still accept that this left it open as to whether the agent could have
done otherwise, given that the existence of the cause did not
<em>necessitate</em> the action. Ayer argued that the relevant
contrast to freedom was not causality, but constraint, or compulsion,
which are a &lsquo;special&rsquo; sort of cause. So if our actions
could be caused whilst not being &lsquo;constrained&rsquo; in any way,
then determinism could be true and we could still be free. It was just
as well that this position was available, claimed Ayer, because being
held morally responsible for our actions required that these be not
the result of sheer chance.</p>

<p>
This leaves, as Ayer recognized, a problem: if freedom is possible
because causes don&rsquo;t necessitate, then am I <em>ever</em>
unfree? Ayer&rsquo;s reply was straightforward. It is only some causes
that deprive us of freedom; if a robber puts a pistol to my head and
demands my money, he has left me without a reasonable alternative, so
I am not morally responsible for the action I am made to do. So to say
that I could have done otherwise is just to say that I would have done
otherwise had I so chosen, that my action was voluntary in the way in
which the kleptomaniac&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t, and that nobody compelled
me to act in the way that I did. (See &ldquo;Freedom and
Necessity&rdquo;, 1954). This &lsquo;resolution&rsquo; of the problem
remains unsatisfactory; Ayer&rsquo;s type of compatibilist does not
have an acceptable account of why it is that some causes are
sufficient to make my action not free, whilst others contain no such
threat. As he says, all causes are equally necessitating &ndash; none
of them necessitate, not even the &lsquo;special&rsquo; sort of causes
that, he alleges, threaten our freedom.</p>

<h2 id="Eth">8. Ethics</h2>

<p>
The emotivism espoused by Ayer in <em>LTL</em> was supported by his
belief in the distinction between fact and value. Given, he thought,
that there were no moral facts to be known, there could be no
verification of such facts, and so moral utterances could have no
cognitive significance. And given the connection between moral
&lsquo;judgment&rsquo; and motivation, and the connection between
motivation and feeling, it was natural to see moral utterances as
having the function of expressing our feelings, or
&lsquo;emoting&rsquo;. This view, Ayer was careful to point out, was
not that associated with subjectivism, that in making moral claims we
are <em>describing</em> our feelings. This latter view would make
moral claims truth-evaluable, and Ayer&rsquo;s moral emotivism denied
that they were so evaluable. So when we say: &ldquo;Cruelty towards
children is wrong&rdquo; we are really expressing a negative attitude
towards killing children, and when we say &ldquo;Being kind to old
people is good&rdquo; we are expressing positive feelings towards such
acts of kindness. The expression of such positive or negative
feelings, he later thought, also contained a prescriptive element, so
in such expressions we are also encouraging others to share those
feelings, and to act accordingly. As this makes clear, the attitudes
expressed were towards classes of acts, and not particular acts.</p>

<p>
Emotivism was thought by some to be the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>
of the verificationist theory of meaning, and indeed it was not the
preferred metaethical position of other positivists, some of whom
preferred a consequentialist approach, and so emotivism could be seen
as separable from verificationism. In fact, in the
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; to the second edition of <em>LTL</em> Ayer
stated that his commitment to emotivism would survive any demise of
his positivism, and it later became clear that it was because Ayer
thought moral judgments to be not fact-stating that he concluded they
were unverifiable (see &ldquo;The Analysis of Moral Judgments&rdquo;
in Ayer 1954). Emotivism was given additional support by
C.L.Stevenson, who had developed his ideas independently of Ayer, in
his book <em>Ethics and Language</em> (1944). In subsequent decades,
it spawned a family of what came to be called
&ldquo;expressivist&rdquo; views in metaethics, which sought to state
the view with a sensitivity to the logical problems Ayer&rsquo;s
formulation raised.</p>

<p>
It has been suggested (Dreier 2004) that Ayer faced a particular
difficulty in defending this brand of non-cognitivism; the combination
of affirming a redundancy theory of truth with the denial that moral
claims can be true looks suspicious. Although the two views are not
incompatible (Ayer denied that moral claims were assertions, and the
redundancy of the truth-predicate held only for assertions), the
tension between the two is symptomatic of the worry that moral claims
have so many of the features of truth-evaluable assertions that one
has to be unjustifiably revisionist in construing them as
non-meaningful. They are, after all, typically expressed in indicative
sentences, and people appear to dispute moral claims. This latter
point Ayer did respond to: moral disagreements were, he (and
Stevenson) claimed, either genuine disputes about non-moral facts, or
simply not genuine disagreements. (For an examination of the trouble
that moral disagreement makes for emotivism, see Smith 1986.) There
was, however, a further, more troubling, point about the role of moral
terms in arguments: moral terms can be used in arguments in which the
moral term appears in a conditional, and so is not there contributing
to the expressive force of the utterance, so not expressing any
emotion of the speaker. This latter point has been developed into a
line of reasoning (called the &ldquo;Frege-Geach&rdquo; problem)
against expressivism in general. The problem for the expressivist is
to make sense of simple arguments such as the following: (1) If John
killed Jane, he did something wrong. (2) John killed Jane. So (3) John
did something wrong. The argument appears to be valid, and so not to
involve any ambiguity, but the moral term can be construed as having
expressive force only in (3), not in (1). Expressivism, and so
emotivism, seems to introduce an unwarranted equivocation into the
argument.</p>

<p>
It is perhaps these &lsquo;surface&rsquo; features of moral discourse,
those that make it look like moral claims are assertions, and hence
expressions of belief, and so truth-evaluable, and that moral
disagreement appears to be genuine <em>moral</em> disagreement, that
later tempted Ayer to consider Mackie&rsquo;s &lsquo;error&rsquo;
theory of moral language (Mackie 1977) as closer to the truth (in Ayer
1984). The details of emotivism tended to disappear from the
metaethical scene in the latter half of the twentieth century, but its
guiding thoughts have remained very much alive in the expressivism of
Blackburn 1984, 1998, and Gibbard 1990. (See Altham, 1979, for a
sympathetic defense of these guiding thoughts, and Schroeder, 2010,
for a thorough treatment of the development of expressivism, with
particular attention paid to subsequent attempts to tackle the
Frege-Geach problem. In the context of Ayer, Pete (2021) has suggested
recently &ndash; replying to Schroeder (2010) &ndash; a
Berkeley-inspired modification of ethical and religious emotivism to
arrive at quasi-realist, compositional semantics that could provide
descriptive-representational content both for descriptive and
normative statements, in embdedded occurences as well to meet the
Frege-Geach problem.)</p>

<p>
From a more general point of view, Ayer was the target of various
fierce criticisms because of his ethical emotivism that was often
labelled as &ldquo;nihilism&rdquo;. In 1948, for example, Ayer was
attacked on the pages of <em>The New Statesman and Nation</em>
magazine by Giles Romilly (1948) under the pseudo name
&ldquo;Oxonion&rdquo; (Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill,
attended Oxford in the 1930s and thus witnessed how <em>LTL</em>
thrilled the public and the university). He argued that Ayer&rsquo;s
view in <em>LTL</em> about ethics were partially responsible for the
increasing Fascist attitudes at the University of Oxford after the
Second World War by creating a vacuum of moral values. Romilly&rsquo;s
charges were taken up by C. E. M. Joad (1948 and 1950), a famous and
well respected public intellectual and philosopher of the 1920s and
1930s.</p>

<p>
Joad argued that logical positivists, especially Ayer, induced the
erosion of morality by questioning its rational foundations. After
declaring all of moral discourse to be meaningless, there remained no
standpoint for positivists from which certain behaviours and beliefs
(like the democratic ones) could be declared right or better than
others (like the Fascist ones). Furthermore, according to Joad,
because of his anti-metaphysical sentiments, Ayer could talk only
about individual Fascists and not about fascism as a theoretical and
abstract system or set of propositions and beliefs, although a
meaningful, deep, and engaging public discourse requires that level of
abstract discussion. In a nutshell, Joad formulated a general
criticism of logical positivism&rsquo;s possibility to develop a
socially engaged and practically relevant philosophy (of science) for
society.</p>

<p>
Ayer responded to Joad by emphasizing that the separation of
&ldquo;statements of facts&rdquo; and &ldquo;statements of
values&rdquo; means that it is the Fascists who commit a logical
fallacy when they try to infer values from alleged facts. In addition,
as logical positivism repudiates metaphysics and &ldquo;Fascists have
hitherto tended to favour some form of metaphysics&rdquo; (Ayer 1948,
30), Ayer denied that <em>LTL</em> provided the foundation for Fascism
in Oxford. About Joad&rsquo;s second criticism, Ayer had less to say
(on the logical empiricists attitude and socio-politically engaged
philosophy, without much reference to Ayer, see Romizi 2012, and
recently Damb&ouml;ck 2022). As Ayer recalled later in his
autobiography, when he had to teach social and political philosophy,
his logical toolkit betrayed him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;[p]art of the trouble was that my philosophical weapons were
unsuited to the purpose. Political concepts like those of the social
contract, the common good or the general will did not repay minute
analysis ad I had nothing original to put in their place.&rdquo; (Ayer
1977, p. 184)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As noted above (Section 1), Ayer was deeply involved in politics
during his whole life, and he considered it as a practical matter,
where his logical positivism does not have much to do with (for more
details of the Joad-Ayer-debate, see Tuboly 2020). He thought that
British political thought was naturally progressive without deep
pressing need of theoretical ramifications and justifications, in
contrast to its continental, socio-politically engaged philosophical
counterpart. As he summarized his stance in &ldquo;Philosophy and
Politics&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not really feel the need for anything to replace this
mainly utilitarian, mainly tolerant, undramatic type of radicalism.
For me the problem is not to devise a new set of political principles
but rather to find a more effective means of putting into operation
the principles that most of us already profess to have.&rdquo; (Ayer
1969, p. 260)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Combining his belief in freedom of the will with a thoroughgoing
fallibilism and revisionism about empirical matters that required a
full-blooded theory of knowledge, Ayer pursued a systematic philosophy
for theoretical investigations that could back up an informed
practical decisionism.</p>
