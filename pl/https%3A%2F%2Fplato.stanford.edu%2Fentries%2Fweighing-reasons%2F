<h1>Weighing Reasons</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
It appears that a lot of things matter for what to do, such as
promises, rights, wellbeing, and so on. It also appears that a lot of
things matter for what to believe, such as what perceptual experiences
you have, what the prior probabilities are, what the experts say, and
so on. When something directly matters for what to do or believe, it
is often called a <em>reason</em> or a <em>consideration</em>. Sarah
can have a reason to visit her mother (she promised to do so) and a
reason to stay home (it would be more restful to stay home). These
reasons compete insofar as they support incompatible actions. Some
reasons matter more than others. Perhaps Sarah is only a little tired
and so the promise matters more, i.e., it <em>outweighs</em> the
opportunity for greater rest.</p>

<p>
An account of <strong>weights</strong> of reasons is an account of
which things directly matter and how much they directly matter. When a
factor matters <em>in</em>directly&mdash;e.g., by systematically
determining the weights of individual reasons&mdash;it matters without
itself having weight. To distinguish these indirect factors from
reasons, they are often categorized as conditions (enablers,
disablers) or modifiers (amplifiers, attenuators). For example, the
fact that a promise was coerced may not be a reason to do anything at
all and yet it could still matter indirectly by disabling the promise,
i.e., by preventing the promise from itself being a reason.</p>

<p>
<strong>Weighing reasons</strong> refers to how the weights of reasons
systematically interact to determine some normative status, such as
permissible, obligatory, supererogatory, epistemically justified, etc.
So understood, it is an open question whether weighing reasons is
analogous to weighing physical objects on a balance scale. This entry
focuses on the systematic interactions that count as weighing, but it
also considers the systematic interactions of indirect factors as
well.</p>

<p>
Note that material in sections 1, 2.4, 4, 5.3, and 8 may be skipped by
first-time readers or those looking for a shorter introduction to the
central puzzles and views.</p>

<h2 id="WeiReaWhaItIsn">1. Weighing Reasons: What it Is and Isn&rsquo;t</h2>

<h3 id="WeiReaNorPer">1.1 Weighing Reasons and Normative Perspectives</h3>

<p>
If Donna is deliberating about what to choose for her undergrad major,
she may weigh the reasons to choose philosophy against the reasons to
choose biology. But this entry does not directly concern how
<em>agents</em>, such as Donna, should weigh reasons in their
deliberations to figure out what to do or believe. Rather, it directly
concerns how <em>normative perspectives</em>, such as morality,
&ldquo;weigh&rdquo; reasons. Less metaphorically, accounts of weighing
reasons are theories concerning the structure of a normative
perspective (Tucker 2025: &sect;1.2). (See Cullity 2018 for an account
of how an agent&rsquo;s weighing reasons in deliberation might reflect
how normative perspectives weigh reasons.)</p>

<p>
A <strong>normative perspective</strong> is a function (i.e., a system
with inputs and outputs) that outputs normative verdicts, such as
permissible, required, and supererogatory. Examples of normative
perspectives include morality, epistemic rationality, prudence, and
etiquette. Many structural questions about, say, morality concern how
moral reasons are linked to whether an action is morally permissible.
How, if at all, does the moral permissibility of going out to dinner
tonight depend on the reasons you have to do something else instead?
Can it be morally permissible to go out to dinner tonight even if
there are weightier moral reasons to instead volunteer at the homeless
shelter?</p>

<p>
Different normative perspectives might take different things as
inputs. Perhaps epistemic rationality&rsquo;s inputs are just bits of
evidence concerning whether some proposition is true whereas
morality&rsquo;s inputs are the costs and benefits of performing some
action. Moreover, when different normative perspectives concern the
same action or belief, they can provide conflicting guidance. Suppose
that you must choose between benefitting yourself or providing a
smaller benefit to a stranger. After taking into account all relevant
factors as inputs, perhaps prudence outputs that it would be
impermissible to provide the smaller benefit to the stranger, whereas
morality outputs that you are permitted to do so.</p>

<p>
When two normative perspectives, such as morality and prudence, issue
conflicting verdicts, you might wonder which verdict is more
important. &sect;8 addresses that general issue. But accounts of
weighing reasons aren&rsquo;t primarily concerned with the relative
importance of different normative perspectives or how normative
perspectives relate to each other. Rather, they are primarily
concerned with the <em>internal structure</em> of a normative
perspective. For example, they are concerned with distinguishing
between different kinds of moral relevance and how the various kinds
of morally relevant factors interact to determine what is morally
permissible. They aren&rsquo;t directly concerned with how
morality&rsquo;s requirements relate to those of a different normative
perspective, such as practical rationality. To be sure, certain views
about the latter issue can constrain morality&rsquo;s internal
structure or which considerations count as morally relevant (see,
e.g., Portmore 2008).</p>

<p>
To give an account of weighing reasons at all, a philosopher
presupposes that the relevant normative system is structured to take
multiple, competing considerations as inputs. If some normative
perspective violates this presupposition, then the perspective
isn&rsquo;t structured to weigh reasons. For example, <strong>Simple
Reliabilism</strong> holds that a belief is epistemically rational
just when it is formed reliably. If this view is true, then epistemic
rationality is determined by a single reliability rule rather than the
interaction of multiple competing considerations. Simple Reliabilism
seems to lack the structure that makes talk of weighing reasons apt
(cf. Gert: 2008: 314&ndash;316). Most epistemic theories have more
complex structure than Simple Reliabilism. For example, more
sophisticated reliabilisms appeal to multiple factors&mdash;e.g.,
reliability and absence of counterevidence&mdash;but do these factors
introduce a competition of competing considerations that would make
talk of weighing reasons apt? Hard to say. It is relatively unexplored
which epistemic theories, if true, would make talk of weighing reasons
apt (Tucker 2025: &sect;1.1).</p>

<p>
Most <em>moral</em> theories do presuppose that multiple
considerations compete to determine an act&rsquo;s normative status
(standard rule consequentialisms and Kant&rsquo;s categorical
imperative may be exceptions; see Gert 2004: 73&ndash;77; Tucker 2025:
&sect;1.1.2). For example, a theorist might hold that both
consequences and respecting rights matter, such that they can compete
to determine whether an act is permissible. If you could save two
strangers by killing one innocent person, presumably it would be
morally wrong to kill the innocent person. The innocent person&rsquo;s
right to life outweighs the good consequences. But if you could save a
billion people by killing one innocent person, then presumably it is
morally permissible to kill the innocent person. In this latter case,
it seems that the good consequences outweigh the right to life. (See
Schroeder 2021b: &sect;3 for a discussion of how weighing reasons is
an extension or replacement for Ross&rsquo;s weighing of prima facie
duties; cf. the entry on
 <a href="../william-david-ross/">William David Ross</a>,
 &sect;4.1.)</p>

<p>
The relevant sort of competition is compatible with there being only a
single thing that ultimately matters. Consider a crude act
utilitarianism: an act is permissible just when it is the option that
causes the greatest total amount of pleasure. In some sense, this view
says that only a single factor matters, total pleasure. Yet even this
single factor view allows different instances of pleasure to compete.
Jenny might be forced to choose between Joe&rsquo;s pleasure and
Jack&rsquo;s pleasure (she can take only one guest to the party), and
so these instances of pleasure &ldquo;compete&rdquo;. If Jack would
enjoy the party more, it makes sense to say that Jenny&rsquo;s reason
to take Jack to the party outweighs her reason to take Joe, and so she
ought to take Jack (Gert 2004: 73&ndash;77; Berker 2007: 117).</p>

<p>
Hawthorne &amp; Magidor (2018) and Titelbaum (2019) reject talk of
weighing reasons partly because the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; of reasons
are too disanalogous with the weights of physical objects, or so they
argue (see Tucker 2025, especially chs. 1 and 2 for a reply). This
entry is neutral on whether there is a useful analogy between
normative and physical weight (force, strength, pressure, etc.). The
term &lsquo;weight&rsquo; is just a way to talk about how much
something directly matters (for a given normative perspective), and
the term &lsquo;weighing&rsquo; is just a way to talk about how what
directly matters interacts to determine normative status (for that
normative perspective).</p>

<p>
An account of weighing reasons needs to explain how weighing is
related to certain interactions that don&rsquo;t count as weighing,
namely the interaction of things that matter <em>in</em>directly to
normative status (e.g., conditions and modifiers&mdash;see &sect;5.1).
Consequently, an account of weighing reasons is an account of a
normative perspective&rsquo;s structure. That is, it is an account of
how what directly and indirectly matters (for that perspective)
interacts in a systematic way to determine some normative status, such
as permissible, obligatory, supererogatory, etc. (Tucker 2025:
&sect;0.2; cf. Horty 2012: 2). This characterization is meant to
include theories concerning:</p>

<ol type="A">

<li>how, if at all, individual reasons are systematically determined
by context (e.g., see the debate between atomism and holism in
&sect;5.1);</li>

<li>how, if at all, individual reasons for an option systematically
combine, or <em>aggregate</em>, to provide the total reason for that
option; and</li>

<li>how the total reasons for incompatible options compete to
determine whether, e.g., some belief or act is permissible.</li>
</ol>

<p>
&sect;&sect;2&ndash;4 focus on C, as C concerns what most directly
determines normative status. &sect;&sect;5&ndash;6 discuss A and
&sect;7 discusses B. The final section concerns how, if at all,
accounts of weighing reasons can resolve conflicts between different
normative perspectives.</p>

<h3 id="WhaRea">1.2 What are reasons?</h3>

<p>
For the purposes of this entry, reasons are just the things that have
weight&mdash;i.e., that play certain direct explanatory roles&mdash;in
determining normative status. <em>Moral</em> reasons for action have
weight concerning what is morally permissible or what you morally
ought to do; <em>prudential</em> reasons for action have weight
concerning what is prudentially permissible or what you prudentially
ought to do; and <em>epistemic</em> reasons for belief have weight
concerning what is epistemically permissible or what you epistemically
ought to believe. In &sect;5.1 the direct explanatory role associated
with weight will be distinguished from the more indirect roles played
by conditions and modifiers.</p>

<p>
Some theorists hold that some such explanatory role is, most
fundamentally, what it is to be a reason (e.g., Broome 2013: 52; Gert
2004: ch. 4; Nebel 2019). Such views are very controversial (see,
e.g., Kearns &amp; Star 2008; Brunero 2018). This entry is not
intended to adjudicate those debates. Nor is it intended to adjudicate
debates about whether justifying an action or a belief is sufficient
to be a reason or whether, in addition to justifying, it must also
favor or commend that action (cf. &sect;4; Mu&ntilde;oz &amp;
Baron-Schmitt 2023: &sect;7&ndash;8). If you prefer, you can replace
talk of weighing reasons with talk of weighing considerations or
weighing pros and cons. While this entry uses &lsquo;reasons&rsquo; to
refer to all and only those things that directly contribute to
normative status, such usage is intended as a convenience.</p>

<p>
It is also worth mentioning that talk of weighing reasons is
compatible with a range of views concerning how fundamental reasons
are within the normative realm. The idea that reasons interact in a
systematic way to determine normative status is compatible with
<strong>Reasons First</strong>, the idea that reasons are normatively
fundamental (Schroeder 2021a, 2021b; Eva Schmidt 2020). But it is also
compatible with most if not all competitors, including views which
hold that that value (Maguire 2016) or fittingness (McHugh &amp; Way
2016) are normatively fundamental.</p>

<h2 id="WeiReaFouIss">2. Weighing Reasons: Four Issues</h2>

<p>
When we have a reason, it is a reason for some option.
&lsquo;<strong>Option</strong>&rsquo; is just a generic term for
something that gets evaluated for normative status (cf. Portmore 2019:
13, 16). Options are alternatives insofar as selecting one option is
to reject the others. One alternative might be to go left; another
might be to go right.</p>

<p>
The lowercase Greek letter &lsquo;&phi;&rsquo; (&ldquo;phi&rdquo;)
represents an arbitrary option. In this entry&rsquo;s examples
concerning morality, &phi; ranges over, roughly, the actions that the
agent can do in the circumstances. In its examples concerning
epistemic rationality, &phi; ranges over belief, disbelief, and
withholding judgment that P. These two kinds of examples hardly
exhaust the kinds of things that can be options. In different examples
concerning morality, the options might be emotions, desires, or
intentions; in different examples concerning epistemic rationality,
the options might be credences, or degrees of confidence.</p>

<p>
In both ethics and epistemology, agents often have more than two
options. When you are considering some theory T, you have three
options: believe, disbelieve, or withhold whether T. When it comes to
action, you usually have many options. Right now, you probably have
the option to keep reading this entry, to call a friend, to jump up
and down, to close your eyes and take a nap, and so on.</p>

<p>
Any account of weighing reasons must be designed to handle cases with
more than two options. Such cases raise at least four questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Is weighing reasons for more than two alternatives just a
free-for-all in which all reasons for all alternatives compete against
each other all at once?</li>

<li>Can something be a reason for &phi; relative to one alternative
but not another?</li>

<li>If something is a reason <em>against</em> &phi;, is it always a
reason <em>for</em> each alternative?</li>

<li>To weigh reasons properly, must all options be considered or are
some options privileged or more important to consider than
others?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following four subsections address each question in turn and
highlight some ways in which potential answers interact. In effect,
this discussion suggests a broad framework for weighing reasons.
Subsequent sections will then consider ways to challenge, refine, or
expand this framework.</p>

<h3 id="MonPaiPer">2.1 Monist Pairwise Permissibility</h3>

<p>
A number of philosophers, including Cohen (2016: 433&ndash;438) and
Berker (2018: 430&ndash;432), argue that epistemic reasons are weighed
differently than moral reasons: one or more principles capture how
epistemic reasons determine epistemic status, and different principles
capture how moral reasons determine moral status. For simplicity,
however, this entry will assume that there is a single way to weigh
reasons that works for both ethics and epistemology. (For a reply to
Berker and Cohen, see Tucker 2024a.)</p>

<p>
If there is a single way to weigh reasons, what principle captures how
reasons determine normative status? Well, that may depend on the
target normative status. In &sect;&sect;2&ndash;3, this entry focuses
on principles that aim to capture how reasons determine permissibility
and requirement. (Epistemologists often use the term
&lsquo;epistemically justified&rsquo;. One usage of this term is akin
to epistemically permissible.) &sect;4 focuses on principles that aim
to capture supererogation and a certain type of ought.</p>

<p>
A standard principle in both ethics and epistemology is:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Monist Pairwise Permissibility</strong>: &phi; is permissible
just when, for each alternative, the reasons for &phi; are not
outweighed by the reasons for that alternative.</p>

<p>
This view is a <em>monist</em> view insofar as it assumes that the
permissibility of an option boils down to a single weight of reasons.
The weight of the reasons for &phi; is compared with the weight of the
reasons for each alternative. This monist assumption will be revisited
in &sect;3. (In epistemology, see Schroeder 2015: 163; Cohen 2016:
430; Snedegar 2017: ch 6; and Tucker 2024a: &sect;2. In ethics, see
Chang 2017: 9&ndash;10; Snedegar 2017: 61&ndash;62. Horty&rsquo;s
important 2012 default logic approach to weighing reasons is framed
very differently, but it may be compatible with Monist Pairwise
Permissibility.)</p>

<p>
Monist Pairwise Permissibility suggests that weighing reasons takes
place, not in a free-for-all, but in a tournament of pairwise
competitions (&phi; vs. the first alternative, &phi; vs. the second
alternative, and so on). Suppose that you are considering whether to
believe your mentor&rsquo;s pet theory T. Monist Pairwise
Permissibility tells you that believing T is permissible just when
both: the reasons for believing P aren&rsquo;t outweighed by the
reasons for disbelieving T and the reasons for believing T
aren&rsquo;t outweighed by the reasons for withholding whether T. More
generally, it says that &phi; is permissible just when it never loses
a competition with any of its alternatives.</p>

<p>
While Monist Pairwise Permissibility is most directly a claim about
when &phi; is permissible, it is indirectly a claim about when &phi;
is required. If it is epistemically permissible to believe P and
epistemically permissible to disbelieve P, then neither is
epistemically required. &phi; is <strong>required</strong> just when
it is the <em>only</em> permissible alternative. Requirement is unique
permissibility. Monist Pairwise Permissibility gives us an account of
which options are required when we apply it to &phi; and each of its
alternative<em>s</em>. If it says that &phi; is permissible and all
alternatives are impermissible, then it says that &phi; is
required.</p>

<p>
Suppose your current job&rsquo;s location could be better for your
family. You apply elsewhere and, being the superstar that you are, you
get two outside job offers, Offer 1 and Offer 2. Pairwise
Permissibility says that staying put is permissible just when the
reasons to stay put aren&rsquo;t outweighed by the reasons to take
Offer 1 or the reasons to take Offer 2. It says that staying put is
required just when it says that staying put is the only permissible
option. If the reasons for staying put outweigh the reasons to take
Offer 1 and the reasons to take Offer 2, then staying put will be
required.</p>

<p>
In one respect, Monist Pairwise Permissibility sets a high bar: for
&phi; to be permissible, the reason for &phi; must not be outweighed
by the reason for <em>any</em> alternative. Both ethicists and
epistemologists sometimes worry that this bar is too high. In
epistemology, Schaffer (2004) and Sinnott-Armstrong (2006) worry that
it leads to problematic kinds of skepticism (see the entry on
 <a href="../skepticism/">skepticism</a>,
 especially discussions of &ldquo;relevant alternatives&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Returning to ethics, whenever you spend money on yourself, you could
have donated that money to prevent the suffering of the world&rsquo;s
poorest. Stephen White (2017b: &sect;5) holds that Monist Pairwise
Permissibility, by demanding that you always justify your
self-interested purchases over preventing the suffering of the
world&rsquo;s poorest, treats you as responsible for the suffering
that you could have prevented. To hold you responsible for such
suffering is, he thinks, to demand too much of you.</p>

<h3 id="ConRea">2.2 Contrastive Reasons</h3>

<p>
Monist Pairwise Permissibility suggests that reasons function
primarily in pairwise competitions. This raises a question. Can a
reason&rsquo;s weight for &phi; vary as you vary the alternative? For
example, can your reason for staying at your current job be weightier
when it competes against Offer 1 than when it competes against Offer
2? If the answer to these questions is yes, then there are contrastive
reasons. A reason for &phi; is <strong>contrastive</strong> just when
its weight value (or whether it applies at all) varies as you vary the
alternative. Monist Pairwise Permissibility is an equal opportunity
employer. It makes room for contrastive reasons, but it doesn&rsquo;t
entail that they exist. Both ethicists and epistemologists sometimes
argue that contrastive reasons are needed to explain certain intuitive
judgments.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with two warm-up cases that involve a single
pairwise choice between two options. You promise to meet your friend
at the caf&eacute;. As you start walking to the caf&eacute;, you see a
child in a burning building. If the only cost of saving the child is
that you will break your promise, then you are required to save the
child over keeping your promise. That&rsquo;s because your reason to
save the child outweighs your reason to keep your promise. It is
controversial whether weight values can be assigned precise numerical
values, but for the sake of illustration, suppose that the reason to
save the child has 100 units and the promise has only 25 units of
weight.</p>

<p>
Now suppose that you didn&rsquo;t make any promises to your friend and
that you will be severely burned if you save the child. It seems
permissible to remain a bystander over saving the child. Given Monist
Pairwise Permissibility, it follows that the reason to remain a
bystander is at least as weighty as the reason to save the child.</p>

<p>
The first warm-up reveals that your reason to save a life is weightier
than your reason to keep the relevant promise. The second warm-up
reveals that your reason to avoid severe burns is at least as weighty
as your reason to save that life. These reasons interact in a puzzling
way when we put them all into a single case with three options.</p>

<p>
Consider Kamm&rsquo;s (1985)</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Caf&eacute; or Kid Case</strong>. You promised to meet your
friend at the caf&eacute;. As you are walking to the caf&eacute;, you
see the child in the burning building. You have three options. You can
stand around and watch the events unfold (<span class="sc">bystander</span>).
You can save the child&rsquo;s life at
the cost of severe burns to yourself (<span class="sc">save 1</span>).
Or you can keep your promise to meet your friend at the caf&eacute;
(<span class="sc">keep promise</span>).</p>

<p>
While it was permissible to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>
over <span class="sc">save 1</span> when those were your only two
options, it is impermissible to choose it over <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s puzzling. The first
warm-up case showed us that the reason for <span class="sc">save
1</span> (100 units) is much weightier than the reason for keeping
your promise (25 units). How can the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span>
be at least as weighty as the 100 units
for <span class="sc">save 1</span> but be <em>less weighty</em> than
the 25 units for keeping your promise?</p>

<p>
If the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span> has the same
weight against both <span class="sc">save 1</span> and <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>, then paradox looms. But if reasons can
be contrastive, the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span> might
be weightier against <span class="sc">save 1</span> than against <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>. And that seems plausible. You have a
very weighty reason to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span> over
<span class="sc">save 1</span> because <span class="sc">bystander</span>
is your only way to avoid severe burns in
that pairwise competition. Assume that your reason to remain a
bystander in this pairwise competition has a weight of 500 units. On
the other hand, when <span class="sc">bystander</span> competes
against <span class="sc">keep promise</span>, you avoid the severe
burns either way. Hence, it seems that you have no reason to choose
<span class="sc">bystander</span> over <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>, and so the weight is 0 not 500.</p>

<p>
If the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span> is contrastive,
then Monist Pairwise Permissibility gives us the intuitive verdict
that it is impermissible to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>.
In <span class="sc">bystander</span> vs. <span class="sc">save
1</span>, the reason to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>
outweighs the reason to choose <span class="sc">save 1</span> (500 for
<span class="sc">bystander</span> &gt; 100 for <span class="sc">save
1</span>). But, in <span class="sc">bystander</span> vs. <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>, the reason to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>
is outweighed by the reason to <span class="sc">keep
promise</span> (0 for <span class="sc">bystander</span>
&lt; 25 for <span class="sc">keep
promise</span>). Hence, Monist Pairwise Permissibility plus
contrastive reasons can explain why it is the weaker reason for the
promise, rather than the stronger reason for saving the child, that
makes it impermissible to remain a bystander. (Given Monist Pairwise
Permissibility, these numbers falsely entail that you are required to
remain a bystander instead of its being permissible and supererogatory
to <span class="sc">save 1</span>. &sect;&sect;3&ndash;4 consider
attempts to resolve this issue.)</p>

<p>
This explanation of the Caf&eacute; or Kid Case assumes that the
contrastive reason is the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span>.
This interpretation can be resisted. What
isn&rsquo;t clear is whether there is a plausible explanation of the
intuitive normative verdicts about the Caf&eacute; or Kid case, such
that the explanation avoids contrastive reasons altogether. (For
discussion of this and related cases in ethics, see Kamm 1985;
Mu&ntilde;oz 2021: &sect;&sect;6&ndash;7; Tucker 2025:
&sect;&sect;5.5, 9.3.1.)</p>

<p>
Some philosophers argue that there are also contrastive reasons in
epistemology. Intuitively, if your reasons for belief and disbelief
are tied or nearly tied, then you are epistemically required to
withhold. For example, if your only relevant evidence is that one
expert testifies that P and another equally reliable expert testifies
that not-P (~P), then you would be required to withhold judgment about
whether P is true. Snedegar (2017: ch. 6), Tucker (2024a:
&sect;&sect;4&ndash;5), and Vollmer (2024: &sect;4) argue that the
best explanation of such facts appeals to contrastive reasons in
epistemology. For alternative explanations, see Schroeder 2021a:
&sect;6.5; Brunero forthcoming.</p>

<h3 id="ReaForVsReaAga">2.3 Reasons for vs. Reasons Against</h3>

<p>
So far this entry has focused on weighing reasons <em>for</em> an
action. But <em>that you would be severely burned</em> <em>if you</em>
<span class="sc">save 1</span> seems to be a reason <em>against</em>
<span class="sc">save 1</span> in the Caf&eacute; or Kid Case. What is
the relation between reasons for and reasons against? For example, if
R is a reason against &phi;, does it follow that it is a reason for
every alternative? Different authors don&rsquo;t always use the term
&lsquo;reason against&rsquo; in the same way. Greenspan (2005) uses
&lsquo;reason against&rsquo; to capture what others try to capture by
talk of &lsquo;requiring weight&rsquo; (as discussed in &sect;3
below). Further, the best account of the reason for/against
distinction may depend on your explanatory ambitions.</p>

<p>
Snedegar (2018) aims to make sense of how English speakers use the
term &lsquo;reason&rsquo; in everyday discourse. He argues that, in
such discourse, reasons have contrasts, so that to be a reason for
&phi; is to be a reason for &phi; <em>rather than</em> some specified
alternatives. He argues, further, that reasons often have more than
one contrast. Cheaptastic has the lowest prices, so its low prices are
a reason for it rather than the relatively expensive Mediumella and
very expensive Gourmeteriffic. The relatively high prices of
Mediumella are a reason against it. While its relatively high prices
are a reason for Cheaptastic, they are not a reason for choosing
Gourmeterrific, as the latter has even higher prices. In this case,
Mediumella&rsquo;s relatively high prices seem to be a reason against
it that is a reason for some alternatives but not others (cf. Wedgwood
2022: &sect;2; Thomas Schmidt 2024).</p>

<p>
But what if the thing to explain is, not the linguistic usage of the
word &lsquo;reason&rsquo;, but how reasons interact to determine
deontic status? Here Snedegar agrees with Monist Pairwise
Permissibility that reasons function primarily in pairwise
competitions (Snedegar 2017: 60&ndash;62). It is only reasons with a
single contrast&mdash;that is, a reason for &phi; rather than a
specific alternative to &phi;&mdash;that directly contribute to
whether an option is permissible or required. If Snedegar is correct,
then reasons with no contrast or more than one contrast can be ignored
for the purposes of determining which options are permissible and
required. (In the language to be introduced in &sect;5, Snedegar
apparently holds that <em>basic</em> or <em>fundamental reasons</em>
always have a single contrast. Cf. Tucker 2025:
&sect;&sect;5.3&ndash;4.)</p>

<p>
When focused on reasons with a single contrast&mdash;i.e., when
focused on how reasons function in pairwise competitions&mdash;what is
the relation between reasons for and against? Tucker (2022b:
90&ndash;91; 2025: 5.1.2) argues that the relation should be
understood on analogy with relation of taller and shorter. There is
just one relation of relative height between Joe and Jack. One might
refer to that relation by saying &ldquo;Joe is taller than Jack&rdquo;
or by saying &ldquo;Jack is shorter than Joe&rdquo;. Whether one uses
the former or the latter generally depends on what one wants to
emphasize in a given conversation.</p>

<p>
Consider again the choice between <span class="sc">bystander</span>
and <span class="sc">save 1</span> from &sect;2.2. Are the burns you
get from running into the burning building a reason <em>for</em> <span class="sc">bystander</span>
or a reason <em>against</em> <span class="sc">save
1</span>? The choice can seem arbitrary. That&rsquo;s
because the burns bear just one reason relation to these two
alternatives. The burns push <span class="sc">bystander</span> toward
permissibility and push <span class="sc">save 1</span> away from being
required. If one wants to focus on why <span class="sc">save 1</span>
isn&rsquo;t required, then one can point out that the burns are a
reason against <span class="sc">save 1</span>. If one wants to focus
on why <span class="sc">bystander</span> is permissible, one can point
out that the burns are a reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span>.
But the reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span> and against <span class="sc">save
1</span> are identical: in each pairwise competition,
every reason is a reason for one option against the alternative (cf.
Snedegar 2013: 240 n. 22).</p>

<p>
A word of caution. Whether this is the correct account of the
distinction between reasons for and against may depend on how the
issues in the next subsection are sorted.</p>

<h3 id="OptIndWeiRea">2.4. Option Individuation and Weighing Reasons</h3>

<p>
Weighing reasons implies a competition between the reasons for each
option. This subsection considers how the competitors in this
competition, the options, are themselves determined. Drew takes a
drink on a specific occasion, thereby choosing one of his options. But
that action can be truly described in different ways at varying levels
of specificity. All of the following could be true descriptions of
what Drew did: he drank something; he drank something even though he
wasn&rsquo;t thirsty; he drank water on a Tuesday in July; he drank
someone else&rsquo;s water without permission when they were literally
dying of thirst and he wasn&rsquo;t thirsty. To <strong>individuate
options</strong> is to divide up (potential) true descriptions of what
the agent could do in the situation into a list of options.</p>

<p>
Some theorists argue that, to weigh reasons properly, options must be
individuated in a specific way, the <strong>privileged</strong> way. A
prominent account of the privileged way goes as follows. First,
options must be individuated so that reasons compete. Your reasons to
<em>drink something</em> and your reasons to <em>drink water</em>
often don&rsquo;t compete because you can do both at the same time. To
guarantee competition, options must be <strong>mutually</strong>
<strong>exclusive,</strong> i.e., to choose one option is to reject
all the others. Individuated in this way, all options are alternatives
to each other.</p>

<p>
Second, options must be individuated so that all the competitors are
identified. Whether some option is permissible depends on what else
the agent could do in the circumstances (Portmore 2019: 8&ndash;11;
Snedegar 2015: 379). Whether it is morally permissible to kill Steve
depends on whether killing him is your only way to prevent him from
killing your family. To ensure that all potential agential responses
are considered, options must be individuated so that they are
<strong>exhaustive</strong>. For morality, a list of options is
exhaustive when every morally assessable act in the circumstances is
entailed by one or more options on the list. When weighing reasons,
then, options should be individuated so that they are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive in the senses explained above (cf. Smith
2020: 116).</p>

<p>
A famous case suggests further restrictions on the privileged way to
individuate options (the original version is from Goldman [Smith]
1978: 185&ndash;186). Professor Procrastinate is invited to do a book
review. He is one of the few scholars qualified to do a review on this
topic, he has the time, he has performed very little service work over
the course of his career, and he previously promised the editor to
complete the next review invitation that he was qualified to do. These
factors suggest that he is morally required to accept and complete the
review, i.e., it would be permissible to accept and complete and
impermissible to not do so. But, if he accepts the invitation, then he
predictably will procrastinate and never complete the review. This
predictable procrastination suggests that it is impermissible to
accept the invitation. This case is puzzling. How can it be
permissible to accept and complete the review when it impermissible to
accept the review at all?</p>

<p>
Part of the Professor Procrastinate puzzle is due to the way it
considers options at different degrees of specificity. <span class="sc">accept
and complete</span> is a more specific option than
<span class="sc">accept</span>, because only the former specifies
whether the review is completed. This difference may affect how their
normative status is determined.</p>

<p>
A <strong>maximal option</strong> is an option that specifies every
feature of the response the agent can control or, at least, specifies
it so precisely that any further specification would make no
difference to the response&rsquo;s normative status (cf. Brown 2018:
761&ndash;764). For simplicity, suppose that Professor
Procrastinate&rsquo;s maximal options specify only two issues, whether
the invitation is accepted and whether the review is completed. <span class="sc">accept
and complete</span> would be a maximal option and
<span class="sc">accept</span> wouldn&rsquo;t be (because it
doesn&rsquo;t specify whether the review is completed). Further,
assuming that there&rsquo;s no way to complete the review for this
journal without accepting the invitation, Procrastinate has exactly
three maximal options that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: (i)
<span class="sc">accept and complete</span>; (ii) <span class="sc">accept
and don&rsquo;t complete</span>; and (iii) <span class="sc">decline</span>
(don&rsquo;t accept and don&rsquo;t
complete).</p>

<p>
<strong>Maximalism</strong> is the conjunction of two claims. First,
the normative status of maximal options is directly determined by the
reasons for those maximal options. Second, the normative status of
non-maximal(ly specific) options is derived from the normative status
of maximal options: a non-maximal option is permissible just when it
is entailed by a permissible maximal option. These two claims capture
the idea that weighing reasons is, most fundamentally, weighing
reasons for maximal options (Brown 2018: 754; Portmore 2019: chs.
4&ndash;6; Tucker 2025: &sect;5.4; cf. Smith 2020:
&sect;&sect;5&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
If we combine the first part of maximalism with Monist Pairwise
Permissibility, then the maximally specific option <span class="sc">accept
and complete</span> is permissible just when
both:</p>

<ul>

<li>the reasons for <span class="sc">accept and complete</span> are
not outweighed by the reasons for <span class="sc">accept and
don&rsquo;t complete</span>, and</li>

<li>the reasons for <span class="sc">accept and complete</span> are
not outweighed by the reasons for <span class="sc">decline</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now consider whether the non-maximal option <span class="sc">accept</span>
is permissible. According to the second part
of maximalism, whether it is permissible is determined indirectly by
the reasons for the maximal options. If <span class="sc">accept</span>
is permissible, it is because it is entailed by a maximal option <span class="sc">accept
and complete</span> that is itself permissible.
Maximalism entails, then, that reasons for non-maximal options, such
as <span class="sc">accept</span>, can be ignored when determining
normative status. At most, the reasons for non-maximal <span class="sc">accept</span>
play a derivative role in determining that
option&rsquo;s normative status.</p>

<p>
Maximalism is not a substantive view about what moral reasons there
are, so it does not settle whether it is permissible for Procrastinate
to <span class="sc">accept and complete</span>. Yet a complete
solution to such puzzles may require maximalism. For discussion, see
Portmore (2019: 156&ndash;161) and the entry on
 <a href="../actualism-possibilism-ethics/">actualism and possibilism in ethics</a>,
 &sect;6.</p>

<p>
The previous subsection discussed the idea that each reason against
&phi; is identical to a reason for some specified alternative. This
relation of identity presupposes that all alternatives are
individuated in the privileged way. If some version of maximalism is
true, then this identity thesis presupposes that the alternatives are
all maximal. This identity thesis doesn&rsquo;t concern how a reason
against &phi; is related to reasons for non-maximal alternatives. But
it can be supplemented with a principle concerning how reasons against
maximal options transmit to (derivative) reasons for non-maximal
options. For accounts of the reasons for/reasons against distinction
that don&rsquo;t presume maximalism and also concern options at
differing degrees of specificity, see Thomas Schmidt 2024 and the
debate between Benjamin Kiesewetter (2015, 2018) and Stephen White
(2017a).</p>

<h2 id="WeiReaExpMorOpt">3. Weighing Reasons to Explain Moral Options</h2>

<h3 id="StaUbiMorOpt">3.1 The Stability and Ubiquity of Moral Options</h3>

<p>
A case with <strong>moral options</strong> is a case in which more
than one alternative is morally permissible. Intuitively, one such
case is the choice between <span class="sc">bystander</span> (stand
around and watch the events unfold) and <span class="sc">save 1</span>
(save a child at the cost of severe burns). This optionality or
latitude is often hard to explain. Monist Pairwise Permissibility
claims that &phi; is permissible just when the reasons for it
aren&rsquo;t outweighed by the reasons for any alternative.
Consequently, it claims that both <span class="sc">bystander</span>
and <span class="sc">save 1</span> are permissible just when the
reasons for neither option outweighs the other.
<strong>Trichotomy</strong> (about weight) holds that there are
exactly three weight comparatives: weightier than, less weighty than,
and equally weighty as. Given Trichotomy and Monist Pairwise
Permissibility, <span class="sc">bystander</span> and <span class="sc">save
1</span> are moral options only if the reasons for the
options are exactly tied (equally weighty).</p>

<p>
Monist Pairwise Permissibility is a monist view insofar as it assumes
that reasons each have only a single weight value, <em>the</em> weight
of a reason. Hence, call the conjunction of Monist Pairwise
Permissibility and Trichotomy <strong>Simple Weight Monism</strong>.
This simple view of moral options seems inadequate. It cannot explain
either the stability or the ubiquity of moral options.</p>

<p>
Moral options are often stable in the following sense: a case begins
with moral options, you increase or &ldquo;sweeten&rdquo; the reasons
on only one side (or decrease them), and the moral options remain
(Tucker 2023a; cf. Chang 2017). Consider again <span class="sc">bystander</span>
and <span class="sc">save 1</span>.
Replace <span class="sc">save 1</span> with <span class="sc">save
1<sup><strong>+</strong></sup></span>: the child in the burning
building is holding a small dog, such that saving the child will also
save the small dog. Your reasons to choose <span class="sc">save
1<sup>+</sup></span> are weightier than your reasons to choose <span class="sc">save
1</span>; however, you still aren&rsquo;t required to
choose <span class="sc">save 1<sup>+</sup></span> over <span class="sc">bystander</span>.
The problem for Simple Weight Monism is
that ties in weight quantities are very fragile: any change to one
side breaks the tie. If two reasons are tied at 5 units and one is
increased to 5.001, the tie is broken. If ties were the only
explanation of moral options, then moral options would never be
stable.</p>

<p>
Moral options are ubiquitous or prevalent, i.e., agents frequently
have moral options (Raz 1999: 100; Portmore 2019: 9). Right now, it
would be permissible to keep reading this entry; stop reading and
donate to an effective charity; do the dishes; get some exercise; and
so on. It seems unlikely that the reasons for each of these options is
exactly tied. If ties were the only way to explain moral options, then
moral options would occur much less frequently than they actually
do.</p>

<p>
The simple view (the conjunction of Monist Pairwise Permissibility and
Trichotomy) is too simple to explain the stability and ubiquity of
moral options. Ethicists must pay the price of complication. On the
other hand, Simple Weight Monism is more plausible in epistemology. A
case with <strong>epistemic options</strong>, is a case in which more
than one doxastic alternative is permissible (for a single subject at
a single time). For example, if my total body of evidence makes it
permissible to believe P and permissible to instead withhold whether
P, then I have epistemic options. Simple Weight Monism can&rsquo;t
explain the stability or ubiquity of epistemic options any more than
it can explain the stability and ubiquity of moral options; however,
it is much more controversial that epistemic options exist than it is
that moral options exist.</p>

<p>
In epistemology, it is common to endorse <strong>Epistemic
Uniqueness:</strong> for any given total body of evidence E concerning
whether P is true, there is at most one permissible doxastic attitude
to take toward P (Roger White 2005; Greco &amp; Hedden 2016). For
example, if your evidence makes it permissible to believe that the
caf&eacute;&rsquo;s dessert of the day is apple pie, Epistemic
Uniqueness says that it is impermissible to disbelieve or withhold
concerning that claim. More generally, if Epistemic Uniqueness is
true, then epistemic options are impossible and thus pose no threat to
Simple Weight Monism.</p>

<p>
<strong>Epistemic Permissivism</strong> is the denial of Epistemic
Uniqueness, but the most popular versions of Epistemic Permissivism
also deny that epistemic options exist (Podgorski 2016). They allow
that different people can share the same body of evidence and
permissibly have different doxastic attitudes (e.g., Schoenfield
2014a, Meacham 2013). Yet to establish the existence of epistemic
options, an epistemic permissivism must entail that, for a single
person, a single time, and a single total body of evidence, the
subject can permissibly take different doxastic attitudes in response
to that evidence (for defenses of epistemic options see Jackson
forthcoming and Li 2018, 2019).</p>

<h3 id="IncPar">3.2 Incommensurability and Parity</h3>

<p>
Simple Weight Monism has two components: Trichotomy and Monist
Pairwise Permissibility. This gives us two compatible strategies for
explaining the stability and ubiquity of moral options: replace
Trichotomy and replace Monist Pairwise Permissibility. Ruth Chang
rejects Trichotomy in favor of <strong>Tetrachotomy:</strong> the only
weight comparatives are weightier than, less weighty than, equally
weighty as, and <em>on a par with</em>. Two reasons are
<strong>incommensurable</strong> when they can&rsquo;t be precisely
compared (Chang 1997: 1&ndash;2; 2017: 6&ndash;7). When options are
incommensurable, they might be comparable if they can be imprecisely
compared. Equality is a precise comparison. Parity is like an
imprecise kind of equality. A key difference is that, while small
improvements necessarily break ties, they don&rsquo;t normally break
parities (Chang 2002, 2017; cf. Rabinowicz 2008, 2012). If a given
philosophy career is on a par with a given law career, then they
generally remain on a par if you add an extra $100 per year to the
philosophy career. More generally, two options might be on a par when
neither option is better than the other, and they can&rsquo;t be
compared precisely enough to be exactly equal.</p>

<p>
Call the conjunction of Tetrachotomy and Monist Pairwise
Permissibility, <strong>Parity Weight Monism</strong>. Chang (2017)
and Cullity (2018) endorse something like this position, and perhaps
also Raz (1999) and Rabinowicz (2008, 2012). An advantage is that it
can explain the stability and ubiquity of moral options.</p>

<p>
Suppose that beating up Jerry is your only way to save five lives.
This gives you two options: respect Jerry&rsquo;s right not to be
beaten up (<span class="sc">respect</span>) or beat up Jerry to save
five lives (<span class="sc">save 5</span>). Monist Pairwise
Permissibility holds that <span class="sc">respect</span> and <span class="sc">save
5</span> are morally permissible options as long as
neither reason outweighs the other. Given Trichotomy, the only way
neither could outweigh the other is if the reasons were equally
weighty. Tetrachotomy adds a second way that neither reason outweighs
the other: they are on a par. Parity Weight Monism holds, then, that
<span class="sc">respect</span> and <span class="sc">save 5</span> are
moral options if the reasons are either tied or on a par. Arguably,
the reasons for <span class="sc">respect</span> and <span class="sc">save
5</span> are on a par.</p>

<p>
Since small improvements don&rsquo;t normally break
parities&mdash;since parities are themselves stable&mdash;Parity
Weight Monism can explain the stability of the moral options in <span class="sc">respect</span>
vs. <span class="sc">save 5</span>. Suppose
that beating up Jerry will now save six lives (<span class="sc">save
6</span>). If you are forced to choose between <span class="sc">respect</span>
and <span class="sc">save 6</span>, the
reasons for the two options still seem to be on a par. Consequently,
the choice still involves moral options and stability is explained.
The more stable parities are, the more likely that any two randomly
selected reasons will be on a par. Hence, the stability of parity
plausibly explains the ubiquity of moral options.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers object to Parity Weight Monism by attacking parity
itself. Dorr, Nebel, &amp; Zeuhl (2023) reject Tetrachotomy and
parity, partly on the basis of linguistic considerations (see Carlson
and Risberg 2024 for a reply). Schoenfield (2014b) complains that
parity conflicts with standard decision theory. Other philosophers
object that, even if parity does exist, it cannot explain common kinds
of moral options.</p>

<p>
<strong>Permissible partiality</strong> toward yourself, your
projects, or your loved ones involves choosing a permissible option
that is worse than some other alternative. Perhaps permissible
partiality can be required when it is due, e.g., to special
relationships. Maybe you are sometimes required to benefit your own
child even though you could provide even greater benefits to other
children instead (cf. &sect;5.1). Our focus, though, is on morally
optional, not required, permissible partiality.</p>

<p>
Consider again <span class="sc">bystander</span> and <span class="sc">save
1</span>. The severe burns you would get saving the
child make it permissible to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>;
however, it would be even better to choose <span class="sc">save
1</span>. If <span class="sc">save 1</span> is better than <span class="sc">bystander</span>,
then presumably you have weightier reason
to choose it. But now Parity Weight Monism&rsquo;s commitment to
Monist Pairwise Permissibility kicks in and we are stuck with this
counterintuitive result: it is impermissible to choose <span class="sc">bystander</span>,
because the reason for it is outweighed
by the reason for <span class="sc">save 1</span>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Supererogation</strong> involves choosing an option that is
morally permissible and morally better than some morally permissible
alternative. Morally optional permissible partiality and
supererogation are often two sides of the same choice. If you choose
<span class="sc">bystander</span>, you are permissibly partial toward
yourself over the stranger. If you choose <span class="sc">save
1</span>, you go beyond the call of duty in a morally good way and do
something supererogatory. If morally optional permissible partiality
and/or supererogation exist, then Monist Pairwise Permissibility and
Parity Monism must be rejected (Tucker 2023a: &sect;1.3; cf. Hurka and
Shubert 2012: 1; Mu&ntilde;oz 2021: 713 n. 12). One response to this
objection is to bite the bullet and hold that <span class="sc">bystander</span>
is <em>morally</em> impermissible but then
to find some other sense of &lsquo;permissible&rsquo; to capture
intuitions about permissible partiality and supererogation (Dorsey
2016: ch. 4).</p>

<h3 id="WeiPlu">3.3 Weight Pluralism</h3>

<p>
Monist Pairwise Permissibility assumes that each reason has just a
single weight value. <strong>Weight Pluralism</strong> denies this
assumption. It claims that reasons have more than one weight value
that aren&rsquo;t always equal. Following Josh Gert (2003, 2004,
2007a), a standard kind of pluralism holds that reasons have at least
two weight values, justifying and requiring weight. A reason&rsquo;s
<strong>justifying weight</strong> is how good it is at making an
option permissible. A reason&rsquo;s <strong>requiring weight</strong>
is how good it is at making a permissible option required. Since a
permissible option is required when the alternatives are
impermissible, requiring weight is, in effect, how good a reason is at
making the alternatives impermissible.</p>

<p>
Some charities are very effective at doing good with relatively small
amounts of money. You could spend some money to go out to eat or you
could donate that money to feed five hungry children for a single
meal. Intuitively, it is often morally permissible to eat out for the
self-interested reason that you enjoy it. Your self-interested reason
is good at making eating out permissible and thus has substantial
justifying weight. On the other hand, self-interested reasons
aren&rsquo;t very good at making permissible actions required. You are
hardly required to eat out when you could otherwise feed five
children. Nor would you be required to eat out even if you could
otherwise feed only a single hungry child. Since self-interested
reasons are better at making acts permissible than making permissible
acts required, they have more justifying than requiring weight (Tucker
2025: &sect;1.3).</p>

<p>
The above characterizations of justifying and requiring weight suggest
that justifying weight for &phi; and requiring weight for an
alternative compete. The justifying weight for &phi; pushes &phi;
toward permissibility. The harder it pushes, the better it is at
making &phi; permissible. The requiring weight for ~&phi; pushes &phi;
toward impermissibility. The harder it pushes, the better it is at
making &phi; impermissible. Perhaps it is this competition that
determines whether &phi; is permissible:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility</strong>: &phi; is
permissible just when the <em>justifying</em> weight for &phi; is not
outweighed by the <em>requiring</em> weight for any alternative.</p>

<p>
(See Mu&ntilde;oz 2021; Tucker 2023a: &sect;6; 2025: &sect;7.6.)</p>

<p>
Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility determines requirement in basically
the same way that its Monist counterpart does: if you apply the
principle to &phi; and each of its alternatives, it says that &phi; is
required just when it says that &phi; is permissible and each
alternative is impermissible.</p>

<p>
Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility can account for the stability and
ubiquity of moral options when reasons have more justifying than
requiring weight. The more that a reason&rsquo;s justifying weight
outstrips its requiring weight, the more stable and ubiquitous the
moral options it creates (Tucker 2025: &sect;7.3). The stability of
moral options was already illustrated in the simple eating-out example
above. You began with moral options to eat out or donate to feed five.
The moral options remain after reducing the altruistic reason to
feeding one. Since self-interested reasons are so much better at
making acts permissible than required, they tend to generate stable
moral options to do the self-interested option over altruistic
alternatives. Choices between self-interest and altruism are
ubiquitous, so moral options are likely ubiquitous.</p>

<p>
Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility can also explain morally optional
permissible partiality. Recall <span class="sc">bystander</span> vs.
<span class="sc">save 1</span>. <span class="sc">bystander</span> is
worse than <span class="sc">save 1</span>, but it is still
permissible. For the sake of illustration, suppose that the
self-interested reason <em>avoiding severe burns</em> has a justifying
weight of 500 and a requiring weight of 5, and the altruistic reason
to save the child has 100 units of both justifying and requiring
weight. Given these numbers, <span class="sc">save 1</span> is
permissible because 100 justifying weight for <span class="sc">save
1</span> outweighs 5 requiring weight for <span class="sc">bystander</span>.
Yet <span class="sc">bystander</span> is
also permissible because 500 justifying weight for <span class="sc">bystander</span>
outweighs 100 requiring weight for <span class="sc">save
1</span>. Since the worse option is permissible, the
existence of morally optional permissible partiality has been
vindicated.</p>

<p>
The main argument for Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility is that it is
the only account of weighing reasons known to explain morally optional
permissible partiality, as well as the stability and ubiquity of moral
options more generally. Proponents also allege that it helps explains
supererogation (Massoud 2016; Mu&ntilde;oz 2021); the relation between
moral and rational requirements (Portmore 2008); prohibition dilemmas
(Tucker 2022a: &sect;7.2; 2024b: 25&ndash;26; 2025:
&sect;4.2.2&ndash;3); and a variety of other puzzles concerning
apparent intransitivities and/or small improvements (Archer 2016;
Mu&ntilde;oz 2021; Tucker 2023a; 2025: chs. 6&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Tenenbaum objects to the idea that a reason can have more justifying
than requiring weight (2007: 162&ndash;174). He worries that such
reasons would allow agents to switch between options in a
problematically arbitrary way (see Gert 2007b and Tucker 2017: 1375 n.
16 for replies; see Roger White 2005 for a similar objection to
epistemic permissivism). Bedke (2011: &sect;1.2) and Snedegar (2016:
&sect;7.7) don&rsquo;t object to the idea that reasons can have more
justifying than requiring weight, but they do worry that these weight
values can&rsquo;t provide a good account of ought. This leads us to
our next topic.</p>

<h2 id="WeiReaForOugSup">4. Weighing Reasons for Ought and Supererogation</h2>

<p>
This entry has thus far focused on weighing reasons for permissibility
and statuses that boil down to permissibility, such as moral options
(more than one permissible alternative) and requirements (only one
permissible alternative). Yet some normative statuses imply
comparative evaluations that go beyond permissibility. Supererogation
and some accounts of ought assume that two alternatives can have the
same moral deontic status (both be morally permissible) and yet one
alternative is <em>morally better</em> than the other. How do we weigh
reasons to determine such comparative evaluations?</p>

<p>
There is arguably a sense of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; that treats oughts as
requirements (Broome 2013: &sect;&sect;2.4, 7.5; Thomas Schmidt 2024:
250). Weighing reasons for that sort of ought is nothing more than
weighing reasons for requirements (aka: obligations), which was
covered in &sect;&sect;2&ndash;3. Yet a distinct sense of
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; treats ought as the best thing to do (for a given
normative perspective). You <strong>morally ought</strong> to &phi;
just when it is your <em>morally best</em> permissible option
(Snedegar 2016; Portmore 2019; Mullins 2021). In this sense, sometimes
the best thing&mdash;what you ought to do&mdash;goes beyond what you
are required to do. Perhaps you ought to send your mother some flowers
for her birthday even though you are required only to send her a card
(Portmore 2019: 11&ndash;12). Additional machinery is needed to weigh
reasons for this latter sense of &lsquo;ought&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
The latter sense of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; is sometimes characterized by
saying that you ought to do <em>what you have most reason to do</em>,
where it is assumed that what you have most reason to do will be the
best thing to do (Portmore 2019: ch. 1; cf. Snedegar 2016:
155&ndash;162). The phrase &ldquo;most reason to do&rdquo; suggests
that reasons provide only a single ranking that matters for
what&rsquo;s morally better, e.g., that reasons have only a single
weight value (<em>the</em> weight of reasons) or that only one weight
value matters for what&rsquo;s morally better (e.g., the
<em>requiring</em> weight of reasons). Since these assumptions are
actively debated in the literature, this entry sticks to the more
generic <em>ought as the best thing to do</em> characterization rather
than the <em>ought as what you have most reason to do</em>
characterization (cf. Gert 2007a: 549&ndash;550; Tucker 2025:
&sect;8.1.2).</p>

<p>
An action is <strong>morally supererogatory</strong> only when it is a
morally permissible option that is morally better than some morally
permissible alternative (Archer 2016; Portmore 2019; Mu&ntilde;oz
2021; for an alternative conception of supererogation, see Dorsey
2016: ch. 4). Paradigmatic examples involve heroic sacrifice for the
sake of others, such as choosing <span class="sc">save 1</span> (save
a child, getting severely burned in the process) over <span class="sc">bystander</span>
(stand around and do nothing). If <span class="sc">save
1</span> is the morally best thing you can do in the
circumstances, then it might be both supererogatory and what you ought
to do. This characterization of supererogation provides only a
necessary condition because it is controversial which further
conditions need to be met for an act to be supererogatory. One issue
is whether the supererogatory act must involve some sort of cost to
the agent (Benn 2018).</p>

<p>
For the relevant senses of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; and
&lsquo;supererogation&rsquo;, there are two things that need
explanation: how the target cases can have moral options (how both
options can be permissible) and how one option can be better than
another when they are both permissible. In passing, it is worth noting
that these senses of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; and
&lsquo;supererogation&rsquo; are not common in epistemology, precisely
because epistemologists rarely endorse the existence of epistemic
options (&sect;3.1 above; see Li 2018 for an exception and Hedberg
2014 for an alternative sense of &lsquo;epistemic
supererogation&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
With the exception of Bedke 2011 (see Snedegar 2016: &sect;7.6 for
discussion of Bedke&rsquo;s view), proponents of Weight Pluralism have
taken the lead in trying to explain ought and supererogation. They
explain moral options as described in &sect;3, by endorsing Pluralist
Pairwise Permissibility and the idea that some reasons have more
justifying than requiring weight. As Bedke (2011: &sect;1.2) and
Snedegar (2016: &sect;7.7) have stressed, this machinery fails as an
explanation of which options are morally better than others when they
have the same deontic status. Moral justifying and requiring weight
are defined in terms of their systematic roles in making actions
morally permissible and/or required. They are not defined in terms of
whether they make one morally permissible action morally better than
another.</p>

<p>
This conceptual point hasn&rsquo;t deterred Weight Pluralists. Some
Weight Pluralists point out that justifying and requiring weight may
very well play some roles that go beyond the ones they play by
definition. For example, Mu&ntilde;oz defends:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Simple Betterness:</strong> &phi; is better than some
alternative just when there is more requiring weight for &phi; than
the alternative.</p>

<p>
(See Mu&ntilde;oz 2021, especially 702, 712&ndash;713 nn. 1 and 5; cf.
Massoud 2016: &sect;IV; see Mullins 2021: 585&ndash;586 for a rival
account that ranks options according to justifying weight instead of
requiring weight.)</p>

<p>
Simple Betterness is intended to supplement Pluralist Pairwise
Permissibility. The latter claims that permissibility is determined by
one competition: the <em>justifying</em> weight for &phi; vs. the
requiring weight for the alternatives. The former claims that relative
rankings of betterness are determined by a distinct competition: the
<em>requiring</em> weight for &phi; vs. the requiring weight for the
alternatives.</p>

<p>
Simple Betterness provides a straightforward account of ought: you
ought to choose the permissible option with the most requiring weight
in its favor. You apply Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility to determine
which options are permissible. And then you apply Simple Betterness to
determine which permissible options are better than others. If there
is a permissible option with more requiring weight in its favor than
any other, then that&rsquo;s what you ought to do even if you
aren&rsquo;t required to do it.</p>

<p>
The conjunction of Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility and Simple
Betterness also provides a plausible account of why <span class="sc">save
1</span> is supererogatory when the only alternative
is <span class="sc">bystander</span>. It was assumed that the
altruistic reason for <span class="sc">save 1</span> (that you would
save one child&rsquo;s life) has 100 units of justifying and requiring
weight, whereas the self-interested reason for <span class="sc">bystander</span>
(that it is your only way to avoid severe
burns) has 500 justifying weight but only 5 requiring weight. Given
these assumptions, &sect;3.3 explained why Pluralist Pairwise
Permissibility entails that <span class="sc">bystander</span> and
<span class="sc">save 1</span> are moral options. Simple Betterness
then entails that <span class="sc">save 1</span> is supererogatory (or
at least better than <span class="sc">bystander</span>), because the
100 requiring weight for <span class="sc">save 1</span> is greater
than the 5 requiring weight for <span class="sc">bystander</span>.</p>

<p>
Many Weight Pluralists reject Simple Betterness. They hold that
relative rankings are determined, not by requiring weight, but by some
third weight value. This third value has been called
&ldquo;merit-conferring&rdquo; (Horgan &amp; Timmons 2010),
&ldquo;favoring&rdquo; (Portmore 2019: 188 n. 4);
&ldquo;commending&rdquo; (Little &amp; Macnamara 2020; Tucker 2025:
ch. 8), and &ldquo;erogatory&rdquo; (Smith 2024). The basic idea of
this approach is to let Pluralist Pairwise Permissibility determine
which options are permissible and then this third value determines the
relative ranking of alternatives (or, in Tucker&rsquo;s case, the
relative ranking of options with the same deontic status).</p>

<h2 id="WeiAgeCon">5. Weight and the Agent&rsquo;s Context</h2>

<p>
Thus far this entry has focused on how the total weights of opposing
reasons systematically interact to determine whether an option is
permissible, required, supererogatory, or what you ought to do. There
are two different kinds of systematic interaction that are in some
sense prior to that interaction. This section and the next concern
whether and how the weight of an individual reason might itself be the
result of a systematic interaction between some factor and its context
or circumstances. &sect;7 concerns how the weights of individual
reasons for &phi; combine, or aggregate, to determine the total weight
of the reasons for &phi; that gets weighed against the total weight of
the reasons for the alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="HolVsAto">5.1. Holism vs. Atomism</h3>

<p>
<strong>Atomism</strong> is the claim that a feature that is a reason
for (against) &phi; in one context is a reason for (against) &phi; of
the same magnitude in every other context. For example, if a promise
to &phi; is a very weighty reason for &phi; today, then it is a very
weighty reason for &phi; no matter what. <strong>Holism</strong>
denies atomism. It says that a feature that is a reason for (against)
&phi; in one context might vary in magnitude (go from strong to weak),
switch directions (from <em>for &phi;</em> to <em>against &phi;</em>),
or fail to be a reason at all. Dancy gives the following kinds of
examples to motivate holism:</p>

<p>
<em>From a reason for to no reason at all:</em> while one&rsquo;s
having promised to &phi; is generally a reason for &phi;, perhaps it
isn&rsquo;t a reason at all (for or against &phi;) when the promise
was coerced (Dancy 2004: 38).</p>

<p>
<em>From a reason for to a reason against:</em> That someone enjoys
something is normally a reason for me to help them do that thing;
however, that they enjoy humiliating people is a reason for me to
<em>not</em> help them do that thing (Dancy 1993: 61; some holists,
such as Cullity (2002: 173&ndash;174) and Bader (2016: 29&ndash;30),
deny that this is a genuine example of holism).</p>

<p>
<em>From a reason for to a stronger or weaker reason for:</em> You
generally have a reason to help someone when they need help. Yet their
needing help gives you <em>more</em> reason to help them when you are
the only person around. Their needing help gives you <em>less</em>
reason to help them when it&rsquo;s their own fault that they are in
this predicament (Dancy 2004: 41&ndash;42).</p>

<p>
To clarify how context systematically makes a difference to reasons,
holists generally distinguish between conditions and modifiers.
<strong>Conditions</strong> are like on/off switches that determine
whether something is a reason at all. An <strong>enabler</strong> is a
contextual feature that makes something a reason for (against) &phi;
when it normally isn&rsquo;t a reason for (against) &phi;. Perhaps a
creature&rsquo;s sentience is what enables its wellbeing to provide
reasons. On such a view, benefits to beavers would be reasons whereas
benefits to bacteria wouldn&rsquo;t be, precisely because only the
former are sentient. A <strong>disabler</strong> is a contextual
feature that prevents something from being a reason for (against)
&phi; when it normally is a reason for (against) &phi;. In the coerced
promise example above, coercion allegedly disables the promise to
&phi;, it prevents the promise from being a reason when it otherwise
would be.</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifiers</strong> are more like dimming dials that
don&rsquo;t affect whether the light is on but rather determine only
how bright it is. That is, modifiers don&rsquo;t determine whether
something is a reason for or against &phi;, but they do determine how
weighty a reason it is. An <strong>amplifier</strong> makes something
a weightier reason for (against) &phi; than it would otherwise be. An
<strong>attenuator</strong> makes something a less weighty reason for
(against) &phi; than it would otherwise be. Consider again the idea
that <em>that someone needs help</em> is a reason for you to help
them. <em>That you are the only person around to help them</em> is an
alleged amplifier of that reason, it makes their needing help a
weightier reason than it otherwise would be. <em>That it is their
fault they are in this position</em> is an attenuator of that reason,
it makes it a less weighty reason than it otherwise would be. (For
more technical characterizations of the holist machinery, see Horty
2012: ch. 2; Bader 2016; Tucker 2023b; 2025: ch. 2.)</p>

<p>
Atomism seems to have been implicitly assumed in most ethical theory
until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Yet holism has been
increasing in popularity, especially since the publication of
Dancy&rsquo;s <em>Ethics Without Principles</em> (2004), and it may
now have the upper hand over atomism. Perhaps the most widely endorsed
argument for holism is that it provides the best explanation of how
special relationships, such as parental or spousal relationships, make
a difference to what it is permissible to do. You can save Christy or
both Amelia and Bedelia, but you can&rsquo;t save all three. If
Christy is your child, you are permitted, if not required, to save her
over the two others. But how does her being your child make a
difference? Holists argue that it makes a difference by amplifying the
reason you have to promote her wellbeing, making her one life a reason
that is at least as weighty as the lives of the two other children
(Keller 2013: esp. 133&ndash;136, 152; Bader 2016: 42&ndash;44; Lord
2016; Tucker 2025: &sect;2.3). Other than Dancy 2004, the most
sustained argument that disablers exist is arguably Cullity 2013. In
epistemology, the existence of disablers seems widely endorsed under
the label of &lsquo;undercutting defeaters&rsquo; (see, e.g., Whiting
2020: &sect;8.2).</p>

<h3 id="ParLimHol">5.2. Particularism: The Limit of Holism</h3>

<p>
The most minimal holists allow context to make a difference in a
handful of cases. The most extreme holists allow context to matter in
every case. <strong>Particularism</strong> about reasons is the limit
of holism. It claims that the context-sensitivity of reasons is so
rampant that the principles that guide this sensitivity cannot be
finitely specified.</p>

<p>
Dancy (2004: 10, 78&ndash;85) argues that the motivations for holism
lead inexorably to particularism. This claim is doubtful (Holton 2002:
197, n. 12; Tucker 2025: &sect;2.4.1), especially since particularism
faces a variety of challenges that holism doesn&rsquo;t face. For
example, Berker (2007) and Gert (2007a) argue that particularism is
incompatible with certain commonsense features of reasons (see Lechler
2012 for a reply to Berker). While Gert (2007a) seems to think that
these commonsense features of reasons lead to atomism, Cullity (2018:
426) and Tucker (2025: &sect;2.4.1) argue that they are compatible
with versions of holism that reject particularism. For more on
particularism, see the entries on
 <a href="../moral-particularism/">moral particularism</a>
 and
 <a href="../moral-particularism-generalism/">moral particularism and generalism</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="SilReaImpVir">5.3. Silencing Reasons: An Implication of Virtue?</h3>

<p>
Given Aristotelian accounts of virtue (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
I.13), virtuous agents have an inner harmony: their emotions and
desires motivate them to perform actions that they rationally judge to
be permissible. Such an agent is not even tempted to do something that
violates what they are required to do. If it would be impermissibly
gluttonous to eat a third donut, the virtuous agent won&rsquo;t be
tempted to eat it.</p>

<p>
This entry focuses on the systematic interaction of <em>normative</em>
reasons, which are often distinguished from <em>motivating</em>
reasons. Very crudely, normative reasons are genuine reasons and
motivating reasons are what motivates an agent to act whether or not
it is a genuine normative reason. (For more on this distinction, see
the entry on
 <a href="../reasons-just-vs-expl/">reasons for action: justification, motivation, explanation</a>.)
 McDowell argues that, if there are genuine normative or motivating
reasons to eat the (delicious) third donut, then the virtuous person
would be tempted to do so; therefore, inner harmony requires that
there be no normative or motivating reasons to act contrary to the
requirements of virtue (1998: 46&ndash;47; cf. Vigani 2021:
750&ndash;751; Seidman 2005: 69).</p>

<p>
This silencing, if it exists, apparently involves something that
disables the reasons for eating the third donut. <em>That Victoria
would enjoy it</em> ordinarily would be a normative reason for her to
eat something. If Victoria is a virtuous agent and her enjoyment would
be a normative reason in the context in which it is gluttonous to eat
it, her enjoyment might motivate her (thereby becoming a motivating
reason for her) to eat the donut. But if silencing involves a
disabler, then <em>that she would enjoy it</em> fails to be a
normative reason for her to eat the donut in this context, which
arguably would prevent her from being motivated by it. That&rsquo;s
tidy.</p>

<p>
Yet McDowell (1998: 90&ndash;93) suggests that what silences or
disables the reason to eat the third donut is the &ldquo;recognized
requirement&rdquo; to refrain from eating it (92) or the reasons that
successfully &ldquo;mark out [refraining] as required by virtue&rdquo;
(93). Either way McDowell&rsquo;s view seems odd. Focus on the second
suggestion. Suppose that, initially, there are no relevant disablers,
there are weighty reasons to eat the donut, these weighty reasons are
just barely outweighed by the reasons to refrain from eating it, and
thus Victoria is required to refrain from eating it. As soon as the
reasons to refrain require refraining, they disable the outweighed
reasons to eat the donut, making them go out of existence. What was a
close, contested victory is instantaneously converted into a landslide
victory with no opposition. That&rsquo;s odd.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most common worry about conceptions of virtue that include
silencing is that they are &ldquo;god-like&rdquo; and not suitable
ideals for humans to aspire to (e.g., Blackburn 1998: 37; Baxley 2007:
411). Seidman (2005) takes a somewhat moderate position, claiming that
silencing occurs but only in a narrow range of cases. Vigani (2019,
2021) defends silencing from these worries and integrates it with
empirical work on how agents interpret, or construe, the practical
significance of their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="ExcHigOrdRea">6. Exclusionary and Higher-Order Reasons</h2>

<p>
Raz (1999: 35&ndash;48) and Scanlon (1998: 51&ndash;54) argue that
there are <strong>exclusionary reasons</strong>, which are
(higher-order) reasons not to act or believe on certain other reasons.
Such reasons have been applied heavily in political and legal theory
(see Adams 2021: 235&ndash;239 for a summary). You promise your
partner that, when you decide how to spend your forthcoming bonus, you
will take into account only what&rsquo;s best for your daughter and,
specifically, your enjoyment of coffee will not be a factor. This
promise is a potential example of an exclusionary reason insofar as it
commits you to excluding certain factors from your deliberation. When
you get your bonus, you notice that you could buy a fancy espresso
machine that you would very much enjoy. Your promise doesn&rsquo;t
prevent your enjoyment from being a reason to buy the machine; rather,
it prevents the reason from being something that you can act on,
something that makes it permissible to buy the machine.</p>

<p>
Exclusionary reasons are distinct from both conditions and modifiers.
Conditions and modifiers affect the balance of reasons. Conditions do
so by affecting which facts are reasons, modifiers by affecting how
weighty the reasons are. In contrast, exclusionary reasons do not
affect the balance of reasons. If there are exclusionary reasons, then
sometimes one ought, all things considered, act against the balance of
reasons concerning whether to &phi;. If there is no way of spending
your bonus that will affect your daughter very much (she&rsquo;s
already very happy), then your exclusionary promise may require you to
spend the money on her behalf even though the balance of reasons is
strongly in favor of some other action (say, buying the espresso
machine or donating to an effective charity). Raz (1999: 36&ndash;46)
boasts this result as a feature of exclusionary reasons, but others
regard it as a bug (Chang 2016: 220&ndash;227; Whiting 2017:
401&ndash;402; Cullity 2018: 436&ndash;438; Adams 2021:
237&ndash;238).</p>

<p>
Exclusionary reasons, if they exist, aren&rsquo;t reasons to not
&phi;; they are reasons to not &phi;-for-a-particular-reason. Your
promise to consider only what&rsquo;s best for your daughter
wasn&rsquo;t a reason to not buy an espresso machine; rather, it was a
reason to not buy the espresso machine <em>for the reason that</em>
<em>you would enjoy it.</em> Whiting (2017) complains that, while it
is possible to not &phi; for a reason, it is not possible to not
&phi;-for-a-reason for a reason. This suggests that exclusionary
reasons aren&rsquo;t genuine reasons (cf. Adams 2021: 239). Keeling
(2023) replies that, if we have the sort of control over our beliefs
that makes them assessable as rational or irrational (i.e., rationally
permissible or rationally impermissible), then we also have the sort
of control over acting-for-a-reason that makes it assessable as
rational or irrational. She concludes, then, that one can not
&phi;-for-a-reason for a reason after all.</p>

<p>
In epistemology, higher-order evidence is sometimes treated as an
exclusionary reason. Roughly, <strong>higher-order evidence</strong>
regarding P is evidence about your evidence concerning whether P, but
the focus is on higher-order evidence that doesn&rsquo;t make a
difference to your evidence concerning whether P. As a foil, consider
an epistemic case of undercutting, or disabling. It appears there is a
pink elephant in front of you, so you have some evidence that there is
a pink elephant in front of you. But many epistemologists think that
when you discover that a hallucinogen was slipped into your coffee,
the appearance is disabled as evidence and as a reason to believe that
there is a pink elephant in front of you. That is, the appearance is
no longer a reason for believing that there is a pink elephant and,
importantly, it is no longer even evidence that there is a pink
elephant in front of you. The evidence about the drug disables both
your evidence for P and your reason to believe P.</p>

<p>
Now to the focal kind of higher-order evidence (Elga 2008). You are
flying an underpressurized airplane and carefully perform calculations
to ensure that you have enough fuel to make it to your destination.
These calculations prove that you have enough fuel. But you then
notice that, at this elevation, there is a 50% chance that you have
hypoxia, which causes errors in reasoning. Here the evidence about
hypoxia doesn&rsquo;t seem to block the calculations from being
genuine evidence that you have enough fuel. One interpretation is that
it nonetheless &ldquo;brackets&rdquo; or excludes those calculations,
such that they cannot justify believing what they are genuine evidence
for (Elga 2007; Christensen 2010; cf. Whiting 2020: &sect;8.3). This
interpretation of the case treats the information about hypoxia as an
exclusionary reason and is subject to the same worries that afflict
exclusionary reasons more generally. For introductions to higher-order
evidence and alternative interpretations of such cases, see Whiting
2020 and the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/higher-order-evidence/#WhatDistAbouHighOrdeEvid">higher order evidence</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="AggWei">7. The Aggregation of Weight</h2>

<p>
When you have more than one total reason for &phi;, how do those
reasons combine, or aggregate, to determine the total reason for
&phi;? <strong>Simple Addition</strong> is the idea that reasons for
&phi; always aggregate by addition. This view is universally rejected
because of two kinds of counterexample. The first is that
<em>derivative reasons don&rsquo;t always aggregate by addition</em>
(Prakken 2005: 86; Horty 2012: 61; Drai 2018: 65&ndash;67; Hawthorne
&amp; Magidor 2018: 133&ndash;135). Here&rsquo;s a representative
case:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Heat &amp; Rain:</strong> Suppose you are deliberating about
an afternoon run, and that both heat and rain, taken individually,
function as reason to not run; still, the combination of heat and rain
together functions as a weaker reason to not run, as the heat is less
onerous when there is rain.</p>

<p>
A common response to such objections is that heat and rain are not
basic or fundamental reasons to do something. A <strong>fundamental
reason</strong> is not derived or in virtue of any other reason. A
<strong>derived reason</strong> is a reason in virtue of some other
reason. Heat and rain are arguably reasons against running only
insofar as they cause misery or reductions in wellbeing. The
fundamental reason at issue is something like how miserable it would
be to run (Gert 2004: 77&ndash;79; Cullity 2018: 424&ndash;425;
Maguire &amp; Snedegar 2021).</p>

<p>
The second kind of counterexample to Simple Addition is that
overlapping fundamental reasons don&rsquo;t always aggregate (Kearns
2016: 186; Nair 2016: 63; Hawthorne &amp; Magidor 2018: 133&ndash;134;
Maguire &amp; Snedegar 2021: 368). You have two reasons not to shoot
Vic: it would cause pain and it would cause severe pain. Neither
reason is more fundamental than the other, and facts about causing
pain are plausible examples of fundamental reasons. Since these
fundamental reasons overlap, the total reason for not shooting Vic is
not their sum.</p>

<p>
Tucker argues that these counterexamples don&rsquo;t challenge a more
sophisticated version of additive aggregation, namely
<strong>Restricted</strong> <strong>Addition:</strong> holding fixed
all conditions and modifiers, non-overlapping fundamental reasons for
maximal options always aggregate by addition (2023b: &sect;5; 2025:
&sect;2.5; cf. Wedgwood 2022: 145&ndash;147). Wedgwood (2022) provides
an argument for something like this principle by relying on various
principles concerning decision theory. Restricted Addition
doesn&rsquo;t tell us how derivative reasons aggregate, but such
reasons are already taken into account by taking into account all
fundamental reasons. Nor does this principle tell us how reasons for
non-maximal options aggregate; however, if maximalism is true, all
reasons for non-maximal options are derivative, and the reasons for
maximal options determine the deontic status of all options, whether
maximal or not (see &sect;2.4 above for a discussion of
maximalism).</p>

<p>
Formal systems, such as probabilistic confirmation, decision theory,
and default logic provide a variety of resources that may illuminate
the aggregation of reasons, and weighing reasons, more generally. For
some important attempts to provide such illumination, see Horty 2012,
Sher 2019, and Nair 2021.</p>

<h2 id="WeiReaWheNorPerCon">8. Weighing Reasons When Normative Perspectives Conflict</h2>

<p>
So far this entry has focused on how reasons determine normative
status within specific normative perspectives, especially how moral
and epistemic reasons determine moral and epistemic statuses,
respectively. But what happens when various specific normative
perspectives conflict with each other?</p>

<p>
Recall the possibility in which it is morally permissible to provide a
certain self-sacrificial benefit to a stranger when it is prudentially
impermissible to do so (&sect;1.1). Here morality and prudence
conflict. Similar conflicts may arise for belief. The evidence might
epistemically require you to believe that the dictator is evil. He did
after all just kidnap thousands of innocent people with plans to
execute them. But suppose that the dictator would spare these people
from death if and only if you disbelieve that the dictator is evil. In
such a case, morality might require you to go against your evidence
and disbelieve that the dictator is evil. How, if at all, are such
conflicts resolved? And how, if at all, is weighing reasons related to
such resolutions? (For a variety of responses to apparent conflicts
between epistemic and practical reasons, see Feldman 2000, Reisner
2008, Conee 2016, Rinard 2017, Berker 2018, and Howard 2020.)</p>

<p>
Let the <strong>supreme perspective</strong> refer to the unique
normative perspective that has final authority over what to do and
believe, the one that settles what to do and believe. It tells us, for
example, whether a certain action or belief is permissible or required
<em>simpliciter</em>. Theorists often deny that morality is the
supreme perspective. Some of these theorists hold that morality is
nonetheless so important that <strong>moral rationalism</strong> is
true, i.e., that you are always required <em>simpliciter</em> to do
what you are <em>morally</em> required to do. One rationale for
rationalism claims that moral wrongdoing is always blameworthy from
the supreme perspective (Portmore 2011: ch. 2; Darwall 2016). Others
grant morality a less exalted status and deny moral rationalism (Wolf
1982: 435&ndash;439; Wolf 1992; Dorsey 2016: ch. 3).</p>

<p>
If there is a supreme perspective&mdash;whether it is morality or
not&mdash;then the verdicts of the supreme perspective settle all
conflicts between normative perspectives. If the supreme perspective
says that it is permissible to provide the relevant self-sacrificial
benefit to the stranger, then it is permissible <em>simpliciter</em>
to do so no matter what prudence may say about it.</p>

<p>
From the perspective of weighing reasons, there is nothing special
about the supreme perspective. Accounts of weighing reasons are
primarily concerned with the internal structure of a normative
perspective regardless of whether the perspective has limited or final
authority (&sect;1.1). If the supreme perspective is structured to
weigh reasons (e.g., its verdicts are determined by the interaction of
various competing considerations), then it presumably weighs reasons
in the same way as any other normative perspective (cf. Dorsey 2016:
13&ndash;14). Furthermore, the same machinery used to explain how
reasons determine normative statuses in morality and epistemic
rationality&mdash;including contrastive reasons, incommensurability,
Weight Pluralism, and holism&mdash;may also explain how reasons
interact to determine normative statuses in the supreme
perspective.</p>

<p>
Of course, there will be some differences between the supreme
perspective and other perspectives. Perhaps the supreme perspective
takes a wider range of considerations into account than any other
normative perspective. Or perhaps it sometimes takes the same
considerations into account but weights them differently than other
normative perspectives (Dorsey 2016: 35). For example, perhaps the
supreme perspective gives more (requiring) weight to altruism than
does prudence. And/or perhaps it gives more (requiring) weight to
self-interest than does morality.</p>

<p>
It is controversial whether a supreme perspective exists. One way to
deny that a supreme perspective exists is to endorse a sort of
nihilism in which nothing matters at all. On such a picture, there is
no perspective with final authority, because there is no reason or
normative perspective that has any authority at all. There is,
however, a less extreme way to reject the existence of a supreme
perspective.</p>

<p>
<strong>Normative pluralism</strong> is the view that, while there are
some normative perspectives that matter or have some authority, there
is no supreme perspective, there is no perspective that has final
authority (cf. Sagdahl 2022: 3; Dorsey 2016: 19). Proponents of this
view hold that there are a variety of reasons and normative
perspectives that have genuine, albeit limited, authority over what to
do and believe. Epistemic reasons contribute to epistemic rationality,
prudential reasons contribute to prudential rationality, moral reasons
contribute to morality, aesthetic reasons contribute to aesthetic
rationality, and so on. All of these reasons and perspectives may
matter; it&rsquo;s just that they are so different that they
don&rsquo;t integrate into an orderly normative perspective that takes
them all into account. (For defenses of normative pluralism, see Copp
2007, 2009; Tiffany 2007; Feldman 2000; Conee 2016; and Sagdahl
2022.)</p>

<p>
In effect, normative pluralism denies that weighing reasons is a way
to resolve conflicts between normative perspectives. Weighing reasons
concerns the <em>systematic</em> interaction of competing factors.
Normative pluralists deny that epistemic, prudential, moral, and
aesthetic reasons interact in an orderly system that takes them all
into account. If the balance of each kind of reason favors &phi; over
all alternatives, then maybe there is some sense in which &phi; is
&ldquo;all things considered&rdquo; what you ought to do (cf. Sagdahl
2022: &sect;2.4). But if morality and epistemic rationality conflict,
there is no normative perspective that adjudicates this conflict, that
takes all relevant reasons into account and then tells you what you
ought to do <em>simpliciter</em>. If normative pluralism is true, our
normative lives may be inevitably and irreducibly fragmented (Wolf
1982: 437&ndash;439).</p>

<p>
While normative pluralism introduces the idea that some conflicts
between normative perspectives may be unresolvable, it does not
introduce any special considerations having to do with weighing
reasons. Recall that prudential reasons (especially self-interested
ones) and moral reasons (especially altruistic ones) are widely
thought to be different kinds of reasons. Normative pluralists often
worry that these reasons are so different that they don&rsquo;t
integrate into an orderly normative perspective. Prudence and morality
may just form an irreducible, irresolvable &ldquo;duality of practical
reason&rdquo; (Sidgwick 1884 [2009: 401]; Sagdahl 2022: ch. 3).</p>

<p>
Other theorists are more sanguine. They hold that morality itself has
a way of comparing the weights of these reasons in a systematic way.
They agree with the normative pluralists that there are important
qualitative differences between self-interested and altruistic
reasons. To manage these differences within a single normative
perspective, some theorists appeal to incommensurability and, more
specifically, parity (&sect;3.2). When there are significant
qualitative differences between two reasons, they may not be able to
be compared precisely enough to be equal; however, they nonetheless
may be on a par or one reason may be weightier than the other. Other
theorists manage the qualitative difference between self-interested
and altruistic reasons by endorsing Weight Pluralism and then holding
that some reasons have more justifying weight than they have requiring
weight (&sect;3.3). At present, there is scant literature on whether
qualitative differences between reasons are better explained by the
normative pluralist, parity, and/or Weight Pluralism (a notable
exception is Sagdahl 2022: chs 4&ndash;7). Hopefully, these issues
will be investigated more thoroughly in the future.</p>
