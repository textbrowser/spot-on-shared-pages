<h1>Marsilius of Padua</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 28, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Marsilio de&rsquo; Mainardini, also known as Marsilius of Padua (c.
1275&ndash;1343), was one of the greatest political theorists of the
Middle Ages. Born in Padua, he led a dynamic life that took him to
Paris, then back to Italy, and ultimately to Munich, where he spent
his final years. Active as a philosopher in Paris, Marsilius became
deeply involved in the political conflict between Ludwig the
Bavarian&mdash;the elected candidate for Holy Roman Emperor&mdash;and
Pope John XXII. Aligning himself with the imperial cause, Marsilius
became a close advisor to Ludwig and accompanied him on his expedition
to Italy. There, in 1328, Ludwig was crowned emperor in Rome by
Nicholas V, an antipope whom he had appointed in opposition to Pope
John XXII in Avignon. Marsilius&rsquo;s most significant work,
<em>Defensor Pacis</em> (The <em>Defender of Peace</em>), is a complex
and sophisticated philosophical-political treatise that rejects the
papal doctrine of plenitude of power&mdash;the claim that all temporal
rulers should be subject to papal authority. In this extensive work,
Marsilius draws on philosophical, theological, ecclesiological, and
political arguments to challenge the legitimacy of papal supremacy. As
a result of the ideas advanced in this treatise, he was excommunicated
by Pope John XXII in 1327.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Bio">1. Biography</h2>

<p>
The information on Marsilius&rsquo; life is scarce, as are the dates
of his birth and death. His birth can likely be placed between 1275
and 1280, and his death in or before 1343. Marsilius&rsquo; earliest
training took place in a rich and lively cultural environment in Padua
between the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Starting in the 13th
century, Padua had emerged as a significant intellectual center,
witnessing the rise of two major developments (Collodo and Simonetti
2012; Hyde 1973). First, figures such as Lovato Lovati and Albertino
Mussato&mdash;the latter being very close to Marsilius&mdash;had
initiated a pre-humanist literary movement that placed the
relationship between the present and classical antiquity at the
forefront (Billanovich 1976). Second, there was a growing engagement
with Aristotelian natural philosophy, which, from the 13th century
onward, shaped significant studies in medicine, astrology, and natural
philosophy at the University of Padua. A significant representative of
this tradition was Peter of Abano, who was likely one of
Marsilius&rsquo; teachers and whose medical ideas would later exert a
profound influence (Siraisi 1973).</p>

<p>
Albertino Mussato reports that, for some time, Marsilius had sought
his advice, uncertain whether to pursue the study of medicine or law;
he ultimately chose medicine (Godthardt 2006; 2012: 45&ndash;49). It
is likely that Marsilius began his studies&mdash;perhaps in
medicine&mdash;in Padua, and subsequently continued them in Paris,
although scholars disagree on the exact date of his relocation
(Godthardt 2006, 2012; Courtenay 1999). The first reliable evidence of
Marsilius&rsquo;s presence in Paris is his tenure as rector of the
Faculty of Arts, held between December 1312 and March 1313. This
position suggests that he may have already been in Paris earlier,
first as a student and later as a master (<em>magister</em>), most
likely between 1310 and 1315&mdash;and possibly even as early as the
beginning of the fourteenth century, according to Courtenay (1999). It
is worth noting that during this period, the University of Paris was
one of the most prominent intellectual and cultural centers in Western
Europe, exposing Marsilius to a wide range of traditions and
influential figures teaching there at the time.</p>

<p>
In the years following his rectorate, Marsilius travelled repeatedly
between Paris and Padua. There is evidence that he was in Padua in
1315, where he served as a witness to the orthodoxy of Peter of Abano
during his trial for heresy (Pesenti 1980). Similarly, in March 1319,
Marsilius acted as an envoy and ambassador for the pro-imperial
Ghibelline league led by Cangrande della Scala and Matteo Visconti, a
coalition formed in Northern Italy in opposition to papal authority.
At some point prior to 1321, Marsilius appears to have returned to
Paris. According to John of Jandun&mdash;an Averroist philosopher and
close associate&mdash;Marsilius brought with him from Padua a
manuscript of Peter of Abano&rsquo;s encyclopedic <em>Expositio</em>
on the Pseudo-Aristotle <em>Problemata</em>, which Jandun is known to
have consulted (Siraisi 1973: 164).</p>

<p>
Perhaps after returning to Paris in 1321, Marsilius started working on
his masterpiece, the <em>Defender of Peace</em>, which, as several
manuscripts of this text indicate, must have been completed on 24 June
1324. At some point after the composition of this work, Marsilius left
Paris with John of Jandun (though scholars are divided on whether he
left immediately, in 1325, or in 1326, see Godthardt 2006, 2012;
Courtenay 1999) and went to the court of Ludwig the Bavarian in Munich
to seek protection. From that moment onwards, Marsilius&rsquo; fate
became intertwined with that of Ludwig. He accompanied him on his
expedition to Italy, during which Ludwig was to be crowned Holy Roman
Emperor in Rome in 1328 by Sciarra Colonna, a prominent member of the
Roman aristocracy, and by Nicholas V, an anti-pope created by Ludwig
himself. For his authorship of the <em>Defender</em>, Marsilius was
excommunicated by John XXII in 1327 along with John of Jandun. In the
final part of his life, evidence regarding Marsilius becomes even more
fragmented, and we only know that he died at some point before or in
1343 in Munich.</p>

<p>
It is well established that Marsilius composed three principal
writings: <em>Defensor Pacis</em> (his <em>magnum opus</em> and by far
his most extensive work), <em>Defensor Minor</em> (a more concise
reiteration of many ideas from the former, with a stronger
pro-imperial stance, likely written in 1340), and <em>De translatione
imperii</em> (which reproduces Landolfo Colonna&rsquo;s treatise
<em>Tractatus de statu et mutatione imperii</em>, with some minor yet
meaningful modifications). His involvement in a few additional texts,
mostly unrelated to political matters, remains disputed in most cases
(Mulieri, Masolini and Pelletier 2023, 13).</p>

<h2 id="DefPea">2. The <em>Defender of Peace</em></h2>

<p>
The <em>Defender of Peace</em> is Marsilius&rsquo; most important work
and the one that has received the most attention among modern
scholars. At the very outset, Marsilius clearly explains the purpose
of his work. As he states, he wrote the <em>Defender</em> because the
peace and political tranquillity of all human communities were
threatened by a &ldquo;perverted opinion&rdquo; (<em>The Defender of
The Peace</em>, Brett translation, 9, henceforth DP) upheld by certain
Roman pontiffs. This opinion&mdash;the idea of the plenitude of
power&mdash;is the true guiding theme of all of Marsilius&rsquo; work:
the belief that the legitimacy of all temporal rulers&rsquo; power on
earth should depend on the papacy. Marsilius describes this erroneous
and condemnable view as a &ldquo;singular cause of strife&rdquo; (DP,
9), which leads to division and factionalism in every political
community and must therefore be rejected.</p>

<p>
The <em>Defender</em> is a lengthy work divided into three Discourses
(<em>dictiones</em>), each based on the type of sources or knowledge
that, as Marsilius states, will be used to support his main arguments.
In the first part, he argues against the plenitude of power based on
&ldquo;sure methods discovered by human rationality&rdquo; (DP, 9); in
the second, he writes that he will &ldquo;corroborate what I shall
take myself to have demonstrated with testimonies of the truth founded
upon eternity, and also with authoritative passages of the saints, its
interpreters, and other approved doctors of the Christian faith, so
that this book should stand by itself, needing no extrinsic
proof&rdquo; (DP, 9). In the third, he summarizes the arguments
presented in the previous two sections drawing &ldquo;a number of
conclusions or lessons of the utmost utility&rdquo;, to &ldquo;all
citizens &ndash; those in the position of prince as much as those who
are subject&rdquo; (DP, 9). Given that Marsilius states in the first
Discourse that he will rely more on arguments grounded in human
reason, whereas in the second he will draw upon the language of
Revelation, scholars have long debated how this distinction aligns
with the overarching argument of the <em>Defender</em>. In the
scholarly literature, there has been a prevailing tendency to
characterize the first Discourse of the <em>Defender</em> as
predominantly philosophical, while the second Discourse is generally
seen as more theologically and ecclesiologically oriented. Broadly
speaking, contemporary scholars have devoted greater attention to
Marsilius&rsquo; philosophical-political ideas in the first Discourse
(Ottaviani 2018; Syros 2012), with a particular focus on his concepts
of republicanism, representation, and the role of the people (already
noted in Lagarde 1934, but further explored in Skinner 1978).</p>

<p>
By contrast, early modern readers were primarily engaged with the
ecclesiological and political-theological arguments of the second
Discourse, especially during the Protestant Reformation and the era of
religious wars, when Marsilius&rsquo; anti-papal views attracted
significant interest among Protestant authors (Piaia 1999). Some
contemporary researchers have also undertaken specific studies on the
ecclesiological arguments of the second Discourse, such as the notions
of the Church and the Council (Battocchio 2005; Garnett 2006). More
recently, the specific practical role of the third Discourse in the
overall structure of Marsilius&rsquo; work has also been underlined
(Brett 2005; Moreno-Ria&ntilde;o 2008). Surely, in the first
Discourse, Marsilius explains how it is possible to institute a
perfect secular polity in which there is no room for papal
interference, whereas in the second Discourse, he rejects the key
principles of the monarchical theory of the papacy in order to present
his own original conciliar theory of ecclesiology. However, there is a
certain consensus among contemporary scholars that the distinction
between the different Discourses should not be overstated, as
Marsilius&rsquo; goal remains the same throughout: rejecting the
&ldquo;perverted&rdquo; idea of the plenitude of power (Briguglia
2013; Brett 2005; Mulieri, Masolini and Pelletier 2023; Nederman
1995<span class="todo_note">a</span>). In a manner that closely
reflects a characteristic pattern of medieval political disputation,
all three Discourses of the <em>Defender</em> consistently integrate
philosophical, theological, and ecclesiological ideas.</p>

<h2 id="RelBetThePra">3. The Relationship between Theory and Practice</h2>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; <em>Defender</em> is, therefore, a hybrid work in
which philosophical, theological, and ecclesiological arguments are
combined with militant political positions. At times, these positions
are expressed in a pamphlet-like style, taking a firm stance on
several sensitive political questions of the time, all of which relate
in some way to the plenitude of power. At the beginning of the first
Discourse, Marsilius immediately explains how he will proceed
throughout his work. He notes that Aristotle had analyzed the
different causes of political dissolution. However, he adds,
&ldquo;neither Aristotle nor any other philosopher of his time&rdquo;
could have examined a specific cause of dissolution&mdash;the
plenitude of power exercised by the popes&mdash; or &ldquo;could have
recognised the origin and species of this cause&rdquo; (DP, 6) because
it did not exist in his time. Following in Aristotle&rsquo;s
footsteps, Marsilius seeks to fill this gap and uses Aristotle&rsquo;s
authority to reject what he sees as the &ldquo;perverted
opinion&rdquo; (DP, 6) of the plenitude of power.</p>

<p>
Scholars have been divided on how to interpret the complex
relationship between political action, philosophy, and Revelation in
the <em>Defender</em>. Some have emphasized the militant nature of
Marsilius&rsquo; message. For example, Conal Condren explains that the
presence of Aristotle, along with other philosophical sources such as
Averroism in the <em>Defender</em> does not necessarily indicate that
Marsilius was concerned with philosophical problems (Condren 1977,
213). Others have pointed out that while the <em>Defender</em>
undoubtedly functions as a political treatise, its philosophical
underpinnings add depth to its argumentative structure. For instance,
Cary Nederman cautions against an approach that reduces
Marsilius&rsquo; philosophical perspective solely to a practical and
polemical intention that motivates the <em>Defender</em> (Nederman
1995a, 24). Another way to understand the practical function of
Marsilius&rsquo; political theory is by situating it within the
Ciceronian tradition. As Cary Nederman has pointed out, &ldquo;Cicero
looms large in Marsiglio&rsquo;s thought: De officiis is among the
most frequently cited pagan texts in the Defensor.&rdquo; (Nederman
2020: 108) In fact, Cicero takes a highly pragmatic approach&mdash;one
that closely resembles the clear &ldquo;call to action&rdquo;
characteristic of Marsilius&rsquo; &ldquo;militant&rdquo; theory in
the <em>Defender</em> (Nederman 1990; 1995a: 14).</p>

<p>
In recent scholarly literature, there is broad consensus among
Marsilius scholars that the <em>Defender</em> should be interpreted as
a work of political philosophy in which Marsilius combines theory and
practice, adopting philosophical and theological ideas to provide a
theoretical foundation for his pragmatic &ldquo;call to action&rdquo;
(Briguglia 2013; Godthardt 2006; Moreno-Ria&ntilde;o 2008; Mulieri
2023a; Nederman 1995<span class="todo_note">a</span>; Syros 2012).</p>

<h2 id="MarPhiMet">4. Marsilius&rsquo; Philosophical Method</h2>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; methodology is shaped by the complex interplay
between action and theory, as reflected in the <em>Defender</em>. In
the first Discourse, he identifies two distinct approaches to
investigating the purposes of &ldquo;living&rdquo; and &ldquo;living
well,&rdquo; which he regards as the principal ends of social life
within a perfect political community. One approach considers these
purposes from an &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; or &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo;
perspective, while the other views them through a
&ldquo;temporal&rdquo; or &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; lens. According to
Marsilius, philosophers &ldquo;could not convincingly demonstrate the
second mode, sc. the sempiternal&rdquo;, whereas &ldquo;on the subject
of living and living well or the good life in its first mode, sc. the
worldly, and those things that are necessary for it, the glorious
philosophers grasped almost the entire matter by demonstration&rdquo;
(DP, 19). In his view, philosophers have thoroughly understood the
principles of &ldquo;living&rdquo; and &ldquo;living well&rdquo;
insofar as they pertain to the earthly realm. This distinction between
&ldquo;living&rdquo; and &ldquo;living well&rdquo; assigns philosophy
two central roles in the <em>Defender of Peace</em>.</p>

<p>
The primary task of philosophy in the <em>Defender</em> is to address
the practical concern of investigating the divisions caused by the
doctrine of the plenitude of power. This is accomplished by
identifying the conditions necessary for the establishment of a
perfect human community capable of achieving self-sufficiency and
maintaining political stability. Marsilius distinguishes his political
reflections from the &ldquo;natural science of plants and
animals&rdquo; (DP, 24). Nevertheless, he develops a political theory
that&mdash;drawing on Aristotle and other philosophical
sources&mdash;proceeds by analogy, comparing the political body to the
biological functions and mechanisms of the human body. Scholarly
literature has highlighted the influence of Peter of Abano and other
natural philosophical texts on Marsilius&rsquo;s method (Marangon
1997; Quillet 1970; Shogimen 2012; Syros 2012). Marsilius&rsquo;s
effort to analyze thoroughly the various semantic implications of the
terms and concepts he employs in both Discourses&mdash;aimed
specifically at uncovering the causes of political stability and
instability&mdash;also reflects his academic training and intellectual
activity at the University of Paris in the fourteenth century
(Courtenay 1999, 70).</p>

<p>
There is also a second task for philosophy in the <em>Defender</em>,
which preserves an autonomous role for theory in Marsilius&rsquo;
inquiry. Although Marsilius does not appear solely interested in an
abstract metaphysical treatment of his subject, in paragraph 4 of
Chapter 30 of the second Discourse, the Paduan writes: &ldquo;no
dispositions to action, other than faith, nor any action that results
from them, is equally perfect as the disposition of the first
philosopher or of the action that results from him&rdquo; (DP, 537).
Here, Marsilius defends the idea of the perfection of
philosophy&mdash;a view widely held among Parisian philosophers of his
time (Bianchi 1990; Costa 2012)&mdash;and argues that first
philosophy, or metaphysics, constitutes the highest form of human
perfection, alongside faith. His conception of metaphysics in this
context clearly also shows that, for Marsilius, philosophy is not
conceived in opposition to Revelation.</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; position on the perfection of philosophy also sheds
light on several genuinely philosophical claims advanced in the
<em>Defender</em>. For instance, when explaining that the final cause
of the polity is not merely &ldquo;to live&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to
live well,&rdquo; he characterizes the latter as &ldquo;having leisure
for the liberal activities that result from the virtues both of the
practical and of the theoretical soul&rdquo; (DP, 18). This idea
echoes the views of Aristotle (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, Books I
and X) as well as those of the Averroist philosopher John of Jandun,
who, drawing on Jewish-Islamic sources (Brenet 2003, 2006; Lambertini
2013; Syros 2011), argued that one of the principal duties of rulers
in a political community is to promote wisdom and philosophy among all
citizens (Brenet 2003, 2006; Lambertini 2013). Additionally, Marsilius
frequently equates the dispositions of prudence and science,
ultimately articulating an epistemic theory of prudence as the
foundation of human laws (Mulieri 2018). It should be noted, however,
that the concept of &ldquo;living well&rdquo; does not refer solely to
the cultivation of the soul&rsquo;s practical and intellectual
virtues; it may also encompass the pursuit of activities aimed at
ensuring the polity&rsquo;s stability and its freedom from
interference by the plenitude of power&mdash;elements that, in
Marsilius&rsquo; view, already render a community self-sufficient and
perfect.</p>

<h2 id="FirDis">5. First Discourse.</h2>

<h3 id="RelAri">5.1. The Relationship with Aristotle</h3>

<p>
The relationship between Marsilius and the Aristotelian tradition
warrants particular attention, given that Aristotle is the most
frequently cited secular author in the <em>Defender</em>. Beginning in
the 1260s, following William of Moerbeke&rsquo;s Latin translation(s)
of <em>Politics</em>, medieval thinkers increasingly engaged with this
text, alongside the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, to address ethical
and political questions (Flueler 1992; Nederman 1996). Although the
<em>Politics</em> was not part of the standard university
<em>curriculum</em> (see entry on Medieval Political Philosophy),
numerous scholars commented on the text and incorporated its passages
into their political writings, either to provide a robust
philosophical and theoretical foundation for their reflections or to
engage with political issues relevant to their historical context
(Lanza 2020; Toste 2020). Marsilius, particularly in the first part of
the <em>Defender</em> (though not exclusively there), follows this
intellectual tradition, referring to Aristotle as &ldquo;the best of
philosophers&rdquo; (DP, 5). Indeed, the <em>Defender</em> is replete
with references to various Aristotelian works, primarily the
<em>Politics</em>, but also the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, the <em>Rhetoric</em>, and others.
Marsilius&rsquo; reading of the <em>Politics</em> has attracted
particular attention not only because the <em>Defender</em> contains
roughly one hundred references to this text but also because, as
explained by Lambertini, &ldquo;Marsilius emerges as an attentive and
knowledgeable reader of the Politica&rdquo; (Lambertini 2023, 42).</p>

<p>
Scholars have long debated the role of Aristotelianism in
Marsilius&rsquo;s work, as this question is closely tied to the
broader and complex issue of defining &ldquo;political
Aristotelianism&rdquo; in the late Middle Ages (Briguglia 2013;
Nederman 1996; Quillet 1970; Syros 2012). Cary Nederman argues that in
the <em>Defender</em>, Aristotelianism is mainly &ldquo;window
dressing&rdquo; used to attract support from Marsilius&rsquo; audience
(Nederman 1996: 572). Other authors have stressed the
&ldquo;ideological&rdquo; or rhetorical function of Aristotelianism in
this text (Condren 1977; Piaia 1999). A crucial aspect of
Marsilius&rsquo;s engagement with Aristotle is his
willingness&mdash;like that of many medieval thinkers&mdash;to modify
or reinterpret Aristotelian principles when he deems it necessary.
Furthermore, Marsilius systematically integrates Aristotle&rsquo;s
ideas with those of Cicero, Augustine, and Ibn Rushd (Black 2008;
Nederman 1990, 1995a; 1996; 2020; Mulieri, Masolini and Pelletier
2023; Syros 2012), creating a distinctive synthesis of philosophical,
Roman, Christian, and Islamic thought. As explained by Syros,
Marsilius&rsquo; political theory &ldquo;draws on various traditions
of learning that extend beyond the Aristotelian heritage&rdquo; (Syros
2012: 5).</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; idea of political reflection, as well as his
discussion of the origins of human societies, exemplifies these two
tendencies: both his reliance on Aristotelian concepts and his
readiness to modify or reinterpret them in light of other intellectual
traditions. For example, Marsilius&rsquo; appropriation of
Aristotle&rsquo;s thought as a theoretical framework for understanding
the plenitude of power diverges from Aristotle on one important point.
While, for Aristotle, practical sciences such as ethics and political
science do not proceed in a demonstrative manner (Nielsen and Devin
2015), Marsilius explicitly states that his analysis will proceed with
&ldquo;sure methods&rdquo; (<em>viis certis</em>). In other words,
Marsilius ascribes to politics the same epistemological certainty that
can be attributed to metaphysics, possibly echoing&mdash; in an
original way&mdash;positions he encountered in certain commentators on
the <em>Politics</em>, such as Peter of Auvergne (Petrus de Alvernia
QS: 235).</p>

<p>
Marsilius primarily addresses the question of the origin of human
societies, as well as the division of the polity into its components,
in the opening chapters of the first Discourse. However, he approaches
these issues in a manner that is relatively original compared to
Aristotle. The latter had distinguished three stages in the
development of human societies: the household, the village, and the
city-state (the <em>polis</em>) (Aristotle, <em>Politics</em>,
1252a24&ndash;1254a13). Marsilius, however, reinterprets this scheme
in two distinct and original ways. First, his treatment entirely omits
Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of natural slavery, which plays a specific
role within the household, where slaves&mdash;like women and
children&mdash;are under the father&rsquo;s authority. Second,
Marsilius pays particular attention to the distinction between the
powers of the head of a household and those of the chief of a village,
a topic to which Aristotle devotes little attention. As Marsilius
explains, while in the case of the household, it is clear that the
&ldquo;head of the single household&rdquo; can &ldquo;pardon or punish
domestic wrongdoings entirely at his wish and pleasure,&rdquo; in the
case of the village, this &ldquo;would not have been licit for him as
the chief of the first community called the village&rdquo; (DP, 16).
Marsilius argues that while the head of a household can legitimately
exercise power according to his own will, this is not the case for the
head of a village, since the village possesses characteristics that
align it more closely with the political community. He clarifies this
by stating that in the village, &ldquo;it was necessary for the elder
to dispense what was just and advantageous by some reasonable
ordinance or quasi-natural law,&rdquo; (DP, 17) suggesting that a form
of political order already exists within the village.</p>

<p>
This position becomes even more evident in the second Discourse, where
Marsilius supplements Aristotle&rsquo;s account with Cicero&rsquo;s
explanation of the origins of human societies. Drawing on
Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De Inventione</em>, Marsilius describes a group of
&ldquo;wise and resourceful men&rdquo; whose &ldquo;inclination,
persuasion, and encouragement led the rest to form a fully developed
political community&rdquo; (DP, 402, 461). Ultimately,
Marsilius&rsquo; integration of Aristotle&rsquo;s account of the
origins of human society was already implicit in his reinstatement of
the Augustinian paradigm (based on <em>Genesis</em> 1:26), which holds
that the formation of human societies and &ldquo;the institution or
differentiation of civil functions&rdquo; became necessary to
compensate for the fall of human beings due to original sin (DP, 31).
This blending of different sources in reconstructing the origins of
human societies underscores the heterogeneous genesis of
Marsilius&rsquo; ideas on the subject and his significant independence
from Aristotle on these and other themes.</p>

<h3 id="HumLegPeo">5.2. The Human Legislator as the People</h3>

<p>
At the core of Marsilius&rsquo; political theory in the
<em>Defender</em> is the notion of the human legislator, who makes the
laws, deposes the government (<em>pars principans</em>) in case the
latter acts against the common good, and possesses supreme coercive
power (<em>potentia coactiva</em>) in all matters pertaining to civil
affairs as well as the concrete implementation of ecclesiological
decisions. In Chapter 12 of the first Discourse, Marsilius argues that
the legislator, which he defines as &ldquo;the primary and proper
efficient cause of the law,&rdquo; is</p>

<blockquote>
The people or the universal body of the citizens, or else its
prevailing part, when, by means of an election or will expressed in
speech in a general assembly of the citizens, it commands or
determines, subject to temporal penalty or punishment, that something
should be done or omitted in respect of human civil acts. (DP
66&ndash;67)
</blockquote>

<p>
As no comparable emphasis is placed on the legislator in Aristotle or
in any other Aristotelian commentator on <em>Politics</em> in the late
medieval context (Mulieri 2021b; Nederman 1995a), the significance of
this concept in Marsilius&rsquo; work serves as further evidence of
his conceptual originality as well as his highly independent
engagement with his sources.</p>

<p>
Three aspects of Marsilius&rsquo; notion of the legislator must be
emphasized. First, his theory of the legislator should primarily be
understood as a theoretical construction that serves as the
fundamental source of the legitimacy of power in the political
community he envisions in the first Discourse (Mulieri 2023a; Nederman
1995a). In this sense, as argued by Nederman, popular consent plays a
crucial role in Marsilius&rsquo; theory of the legislator and his
description of the political community (Nederman 1995a). For the
community to function properly, all members of the legislator and,
more broadly, of the polity must agree on the human laws that are
enacted, the division of the polity into its various parts, and the
election of a particular government (see the entry on Medieval
Political Philosophy). Second, Marsilius&rsquo; description of the
legislator and the lawmaking procedure in certain chapters of the
first part of <em>Defender</em> also reflects the functioning of
lawmaking in the Italian city-states of his time (Briguglia 2013;
Mulieri, Masolini and Pelletier 2023). In fact, in Chapter 13 of the
first Discourse (especially I.13.8), he distinguishes different stages
of the lawmaking process and describes a continuous relationship
between the prudent men and the general populace in the proposal,
discussion, and approval of laws. Third, Marsilius&rsquo; concept of
the human legislator also echoes legal theories of the legitimacy of
power that were prevalent in the medieval period (Quillet 1970:
Rubinstein 1965). For example, his depiction of the legislator as the
people mirrors the idea, implicit in the <em>lex regia de
imperio</em>, that the legitimacy of the emperor&rsquo;s legislative
or executive power derives from the Roman people (Lee 2018; Ullmann
1961).</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; notion of the legislator has been interpreted in
various ways by different scholars. Some, particularly in 20th-century
scholarship, viewed his endorsement of the people as lawgivers as
evidence that he was a precursor of modern ideas of democracy and
liberalism or, more simply, a republican theorist (Gewirth 1951;
Lagarde 1934; Skinner 1978). Other scholars have emphasized that
Marsilius&rsquo; formulation of the human legislator as the people
should be understood as a reaffirmation of the <em>lex regia de
imperio</em>, a point he makes clear in the <em>Defensor Minor</em>
(Piaia 1999; Quillet 1970; Rubinstein 1965). More recently, several
scholars, from different perspectives, have argued that
Marsilius&rsquo; theory of the human legislator is merely a generic
theoretical construction that he strategically advances to gain
support from as many temporal rulers as possible in opposition to the
idea of the plenitude of power (Briguglia 2013; Condren 1977; Nederman
1995a). In this regard, it is also worth noting that, unlike Dante
Alighieri (see entry on Dante Alighieri), Marsilius does not adhere to
a universalist conception of empire. Rather, he believes that
different types of political regimes can coexist (for example in DP,
496&ndash;497).</p>

<h3 id="ColPru">5.3. Collective Prudence</h3>

<p>
If Marsilius&rsquo; concept of the human legislator is primarily
articulated in Chapter 12 of the first Discourse of the
<em>Defender</em>, its philosophical foundations must be traced back
to Chapter 11 (Mulieri 2023a; Gilson 1948; Nardi 1960). In Chapter 10,
reflecting debates common among 13th- and 14th-century commentators on
the <em>Politics</em> and the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> (Costa 2023;
Lewis 1963), Marsilius outlines four distinct meanings of human law
before isolating the definitions most central to his political system.
In its third definition, &ldquo;law&rdquo; pertains to the norms of a
religion and is defined as a &ldquo;rule containing admonitions for
those human acts that result from an imperative, insofar as they are
ordered toward glory or punishment in the world to come&rdquo; (DP,
52). In this definition, Marsilius includes all &ldquo;religious
followings&rdquo; that are considered laws &ldquo;either wholly or in
part&rdquo;, with the Mosaic and evangelical laws containing the full
truth, in contrast to &ldquo;those of Mohammed or the Persians&rdquo;
(DP, 53). Finally, in his fourth and most significant definition,
Marsilius asserts that law can be understood in two ways: as a
&ldquo;science or doctrine of right&rdquo; (DP, 53) when considered in
terms of its content, and as a rule that must be enforced when viewed
in terms of its implementation. For Marsilius, a proper human law must
integrate both perspectives, such that a &ldquo;perfect law&rdquo;
necessarily combines &ldquo;justice&rdquo; with &ldquo;coercive
power&rdquo; (DP, 53). In Chapter 11, Marsilius situates this notion
of perfect law within the framework of political prudence, drawing on
a well-established idea among commentators on the <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> that law requires prudence, which in turn depends on
&ldquo;long experience&rdquo; (Costa 2023). However, Marsilius&rsquo;
perspective on this topic is particularly original.</p>

<p>
He begins by explaining that:</p>

<blockquote>
no one, however virtuous, can lack perverted passion and ignorance in
the same way as the law. And therefore it is safer for civil
judgements to be regulated by law than committed to the discretion of
a judge, however virtuous. (DP, 59)
</blockquote>

<p>
Then Marsilius adds:</p>

<blockquote>
Since, therefore, the law is an eye resulting from many eyes, i.e. an
understanding forged from the understanding of many, for the purpose
of avoiding error with regard to civil judgements and of judging
correctly, it is safer for those judgements to be made in accordance
with the law than at the judge&rsquo;s discretion. (DP, 59)
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Marsilius, the best way to ensure this impartiality is to
minimize the subjective interpretations of judges and instead ground
human laws in an adequate theoretical framework&mdash;one that
consists of a collective theory of knowledge and experience. This is
where Marsilius develops what is arguably one of the most original
aspects of his political theory (Mulieri 2023b; Nardi 1960): a
collective theory of prudence with no clear antecedents in medieval
political philosophy. In his view, the &ldquo;long experience&rdquo;
necessary to acquire prudence must not derive from the knowledge of a
single generation alone but must instead be the cumulative result of
the experiences and insights of many successive generations over the
course of history. As he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
what one man discovers or can know by himself, both in the science of
what is just and beneficial in civil terms and in the other sciences,
is little or nothing. Going further, what men of one era observe is an
imperfect thing in comparison with that which is observed as a result
of many eras (DP, 59)
</blockquote>

<p>
Marsilius thus formulates a collective and trans-generational theory
of experience and prudence as the necessary foundations of just human
laws. The terms &ldquo;experience&rdquo; and &ldquo;prudence&rdquo;
carry complex meanings in Marsilius&rsquo; thought (Mulieri 2023c).
Following Aristotle, he presents prudence as a dianoetic
virtue&mdash;one that requires cultivation through extensive practice,
training and experience. For Marsilius, as for Aristotle,
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; is the basis of prudence, which in turn
serves as the grounding for human laws and ensures their impartiality.
However, since human law is a collective enterprise&mdash;given that
the legislator is &ldquo;the people&rdquo; or &ldquo;the universal
body of citizens&rdquo;&mdash;Marsilius connects it to a collective
notion of prudence. While Aristotle typically conceived of prudence as
a dianoetic virtue pertaining to individual ethical action, in the
<em>Politics</em> he also alludes to a collective form of prudence
(<em>Politics</em> III.11&ndash;15, 1282a14&ndash;16), which can be
exercised by the many through the <em>ex post</em> evaluation of
magistrates within the polity. Some medieval commentators, such as
Peter of Auvergne, briefly acknowledged this collective dimension of
prudence, though without attributing to it significant importance. By
contrast, also drawing on ideas rooted in the Latin Averroist
tradition (Brenet 2006, 2019; Nardi 1960; Tabarroni 2019), Marsilius
places the concept of collective prudence at the core of his political
theory, treating it as the very foundation of human law (Mulieri
2023c). Moreover, Marsilius uses the concepts of experience and
prudence interchangeably with <em>scientia</em> (science), implying
that they share the same degree of epistemic certainty.</p>

<h3 id="BodPolHumBod">5.4. The Body Politic and the Human Body</h3>

<p>
Another important theme in the <em>Defender</em> is the presence of
medical metaphors and concepts in Marsilius&rsquo; work. Of course,
metaphors of the human body used to describe political problems
already appear in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> and were also
present in several medieval commentaries on this text. However,
Marsilius&rsquo; training as a physician&mdash;attested by
Mussato&mdash;his documented practice as a physician in Paris before
leaving the city, as well as his closeness to Peter of Abano, likely
played a role in his knowledge of this topic, which he drew from
various medical and natural philosophy sources (Marangon 1997). Some
scholars have rightly compared Marsilius&rsquo; attention to medical
metaphors to that of John of Salisbury (Aichele 2012; Briguglia 2013;
Nederman 1995<span class="todo_note">a</span>; Shogimen 2012), who
draws similar comparisons in Books 5 and 6 of his
<em>Policraticus</em> (see <em>Stanford Entry on John of
Salisbury</em>). While the latter draws anatomical parallels between
the various parts of the city and the various parts of the human body,
Marsilius primarily employs the medical concept of
complexion&mdash;that is, the Galenic notion of the proportional
balance among the body&rsquo;s various humors&mdash;to draw an analogy
between the human body and the body politic (Kaye 2014). As Marsilius
writes:</p>

<blockquote>
An animal which is in a good condition in respect of its nature is
composed of certain proportionate parts arranged in respect of each
other, all communicating their actions between themselves and towards
the whole; likewise too the city which is in a good condition and
established in accordance with reason is made up of certain such
parts. A city and its parts would therefore seem to be in the same
relation to tranquillity as an animal and its parts is to health.
<span class="todo_note">(DP: 12)</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Marsilius&rsquo; view, one of the main ways human beings can
achieve a self-sufficient life is by ensuring that the actions and
passions of the polity are proportionate, just as they are in a state
of good health in the human body. Marsilius&rsquo; theory of
government is based on the idea of complexion and on the premodern
medical concept of the proportionate harmony of the body&rsquo;s
different humors as a necessary condition for achieving peace in the
body politic (Shogimen 2012; Nederman 1995a).</p>

<p>
Another important theme in Marsilius&rsquo;s work is the Aristotelian
notion of the heart as the central organ of the body and the source of
blood circulation. Peter of Abano argues that the heart is the
principal organ of the human body because it houses both the soul and
human intellect (Petrus de Abano 1504, f. 56v, Shogimen 2012: 104).
The traditional idea that the heart is the governing center of the
body, along with the comparison found in Peter&rsquo;s
<em>Conciliator</em> between this theme and the function of the ruler
in the political regime, also appears in Marsilius (Shogimen 2012).
However, in the <em>Defender</em>, Marsilius presents a more nuanced
position on the political implications of the medical-anatomical
metaphor of the heart. In Chapter 15 of the first Discourse, he
defines the human legislator or &ldquo;universal body of
citizens&rdquo; as the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; (<em>anima</em>) of the
political community (DP, 92). From this soul, he claims, one part is
or should be &ldquo;formed first within it, which is analogous to the
heart&rdquo; (DP, 91).</p>

<p>
As in the case of Peter of Abano, Marsilius shows a slight preference
for identifying the government, or the heart, with the non-hereditary
and elective monarch&mdash;a clear allusion to the imperial office and
the position of Ludwig the Bavarian. In fact, Marsilius argues that
the government, or <em>pars principans</em>, is, like the heart, the
noblest part among all the other parts of human and animal bodies. At
the same time, Marsilius occasionally employs corporeal metaphors to
represent different components of the political community described in
the <em>Defender</em>, one of which is that of the human law as
&ldquo;an eye resulting from many eyes&rdquo; (DP, 60). Joel Kaye has
examined in detail the significance of Galen&rsquo;s two different
models of equalization in the <em>Defender</em>, particularly in
determining the complex relationship between the government and the
legislator. According to Kaye (2014), Marsilius appears to oscillate
between a clear and unequivocal recognition of the legislator&rsquo;s
importance as a horizontal decision-making body and a more
hierarchical, top-down model&mdash;one that, like Peter of
Abano&rsquo;s, tends to view the government (represented by the heart
in the human body) as the directive principle of the political
community, conceived by analogy to the human body</p>

<h2 id="SecDis">6. Second Discourse.</h2>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; ecclesiological arguments in the second Discourse
have generally attracted less attention among contemporary scholars
compared to the Paduan&rsquo;s philosophical and political ideas.
Michael Sweeney&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;the secondary literature on
Marsilius&rsquo; spiritual theology is one of the least developed
areas of his thought&rdquo; (Sweeney 2012, 184) aptly describes a
prevailing prejudice that has even led some scholars to argue that,
for Marsilius, Christianity was merely a &ldquo;social problem&rdquo;
to be solved (Pincin 1967). This view fails to do justice to the fact
that, in the second Discourse, Marsilius&rsquo;s rejection of the
plenitude of power is rooted in a highly innovative ecclesiological
theory and a theory of the general council, to which, as we shall see,
he gives a notably original definition. Two key aspects must be
considered when assessing the second Discourse and its relationship to
the first Discourse of the <em>Defender</em>. First, several scholars
have emphasized that the second Discourse should be read as a
consistent and logical continuation of the first, in which Marsilius
presents his arguments based on human reason (Brett 2005; Briguglia
2013; Nederman 1995a). In the second Discourse, he revisits some of
these arguments but recasts them in theological and ecclesiological
terms. In both Discourses, his primary objective remains the same: to
refute the doctrine of the plenitude of power, albeit through
different modes of reasoning. Second, for this reason, it is misguided
to interpret the relationship between the two Discourses through the
lens of the so-called &ldquo;double truth&rdquo; doctrine, which
earlier scholars associated with the Averroist tradition (Condren
1977; Gilson 1948)&mdash;although the very notion of double truth has
increasingly been challenged in recent scholarship (Bianchi 2008;
Landucci 2006). In the <em>Defender</em>, there is no opposition
between reason and Revelation in the way Marsilius deploys arguments
from both domains to critique the plenitude of power. Rather, he
treats them as complementary, placing them on equal footing rather
than in conflict</p>

<h3 id="DivLawHumAct">6.1. Divine/Human Laws and Human Acts</h3>

<p>
An indication of continuity between the two Discourses of the
<em>Defender</em> appears in Marsilius&rsquo;s theory of human acts
and its relation to human, divine, and natural law. As discussed, in
Chapter 10 of the first Discourse, Marsilius offers multiple
definitions of law. In Chapter 8 of the second Discourse, he expands
upon these distinctions in light of his theory of human acts. In this
context, he slightly revises the fourfold model of law introduced in
I.10 and proposes two additional typologies based on their relation to
coercive power (<em>potentia coactiva</em>). He distinguishes laws
that consist merely of admonitions without coercive force&mdash;such
as those found in the &ldquo;active or productive&rdquo; disciplines
(e.g., the arts)&mdash;from those, primarily human and divine law,
that possess coercive power, meaning their observance or transgression
may be &ldquo;subject to penalty or reward being meted out to those
who do or omit them through the coercive power of another agent&rdquo;
(DP, 215). Marsilius emphasizes that coercive power is applied
differently across distinct domains. In the case of human law, rewards
and punishments are enacted in this life; in contrast, divine law is
concerned exclusively with rewards and punishments in the
afterlife.</p>

<p>
This revised classification of law is related to a complex theory of
human acts. Marsilius begins by distinguishing between acts that are
&ldquo;capable of being ordained to the end of this world, sc. the
sufficiency of worldly life,&rdquo; and those ordained &ldquo;to the
end of the world to come, which we call eternal life or glory&rdquo;
(DP, 213). He then classifies human acts into two main categories. The
first, &ldquo;non-commanded acts&rdquo; (DP, 214), refers to
&ldquo;involuntary acts&rdquo; (Costa 2023: 110), which occur
&ldquo;apart from the empire of the mind&rdquo; (DP, 213), such as
sensory perceptions and affective emotions&mdash;for example, desires
caused by perception. The second category, which Marsilius names
&ldquo;commanded acts&rdquo; (DP, 214), includes &ldquo;imperative
acts&rdquo; (Costa 2023), which result &ldquo;from the empire of the
human mind&rdquo; (DP, 213); that is, acts deliberately governed and
commanded by the intellect, or rational part of the soul. Examples of
the latter include deliberate decisions to fulfil or resist
involuntary desires. &ldquo;Commanded acts&rdquo; are further divided
into &ldquo;immanent&rdquo; and &ldquo;transitive&rdquo;. For
Marsilius, &ldquo;immanent&rdquo; acts are those that do not extend
beyond the subject &ldquo;producing them&rdquo; (DP, 214). These
include internal acts&mdash;habits or operations of knowledge and
desire&mdash;that hold moral significance but lack external
consequences (Costa 2023: 108). By contrast, &ldquo;transitive&rdquo;
acts are performed through &ldquo;some exterior organ of the
body&rdquo; (DP, 214) and represent the externalization of
&ldquo;immanent&rdquo; acts in their effect upon other subjects. As
such, &ldquo;transitive&rdquo; acts are those that extend beyond the
agent and acquire both moral and juridical significance, insofar as
they have the potential to cause harm or confer benefit upon others
(Costa 2023).</p>

<p>
The different models of law that Marsilius presents in II.8 regulate
human acts in distinct ways. Marsilius argues that human laws do not
concern themselves with involuntary or &ldquo;immanent&rdquo; acts;
rather, they apply only to &ldquo;transitive&rdquo; acts, that is,
acts with a practical bodily manifestation (DP, 215). When Marsilius
claims that human laws regulate &ldquo;transitive&rdquo; acts, he
means that such laws are capable of rewarding or punishing individuals
who perform &ldquo;transitive&rdquo; acts within the framework of
human jurisdiction and during this life. In contrast, Christian divine
law&mdash;or evangelical law&mdash;applies to all deliberate acts,
both &ldquo;immanent&rdquo; and &ldquo;transitive&rdquo;. It governs
not only those acts that affect others but also those internal to the
agent. However, the coercive power of divine law is limited to the
afterlife. As a result, its rewards and punishments cannot be
implemented in the present world by human authorities; they are
reserved solely for Christ, the legislator of the life to come. This
implies that, according to Marsilius, the law of Christ possesses no
coercive force in the temporal realm. Only the human
legislator&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the people&rdquo; or &ldquo;the whole
body of citizens&rdquo;&mdash;may determine whether someone is to be
punished or rewarded in this life, including for actions considered
sinful under divine law. Therefore, Marsilius insists that divine and
evangelical law lack any coercive power in the present life. Iacopo
Costa highlights the anti-Thomistic nature of this position. In his
comparison of Marsilius and Aquinas on the relationship between divine
and human law, Costa describes Marsilius&rsquo; view as
&ldquo;probably one of the most revolutionary ideas that a medieval
author put forward&rdquo; (Costa 2023: 120).</p>

<h3 id="EvaPovNotRig">6.2. Evangelical Poverty and the Notion of &ldquo;Right&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
A further indication of continuity between the two Discourses of the
<em>Defender</em> appears in Marsilius&rsquo; discussion of
evangelical poverty in the second Discourse, which includes a highly
original theory of natural right. In Marsilius&rsquo; time, a heated
debate took place between certain factions within the Franciscan order
and the clergy of the Roman Church over whether Christ and the
Apostles had observed the vow of highest poverty, and what
implications this had for the contemporary Church. While the former
argued that Christ and the Apostles had embraced the ideal of highest
poverty and that the Church should follow their example, the Roman
Church rejected this position. Marsilius engages with the principal
arguments in this debate and takes a clear stance. Scholars have noted
that his treatment of the topic in the second Discourse closely
resembles the structure of a <em>quaestio</em>, the traditional method
of argumentation in medieval universities (Lambertini 2012). Indeed,
Marsilius discusses in detail many of the technical terms associated
with the question and aligns himself with the Franciscans, affirming
the view that Christ and the Apostles had renounced the property
(<em>dominium</em>) of both individual and common possessions (DP,
262&ndash;286).</p>

<p>
In II.8, the Paduan distinguishes between two principal meanings of
the concept of &ldquo;right&rdquo;. One, which is central to
Marsilius&rsquo; technical discussion of evangelical poverty, defines
&ldquo;right&rdquo; as a &ldquo;human act, power or acquired
disposition that issues from an imperative of the human mind&rdquo;
(DP, 253). This conception has led some scholars to characterize this
meaning of &ldquo;right&rdquo; as &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; (Brett
2006; Tierney 1991), in the sense that it refers to an
individual&rsquo;s capacity or entitlement to act. This meaning serves
Marsilius&rsquo; purpose of isolating an idea of right that can be
used to ground the legal idea of property (<em>dominium</em>), the
definition of which is essential to any discussion of evangelical
poverty. Marsilius also distinguishes another meaning, more typical of
medieval thought, and identifies &ldquo;right&rdquo; with the third
and fourth definitions of &ldquo;law&rdquo; presented in DP I.10. In
this sense, &ldquo;right&rdquo; is essentially synonymous with law,
understood either as a religious set of norms (such as Mosaic law or
evangelical law) or as human law. It is this latter notion of right
that proves crucial for understanding Marsilius&rsquo;s discussion of
natural right.</p>

<p>
In fact, even if Marsilius takes the floor in the debate about
apostolic poverty, upholding a conclusion that formally concurs with
that defended by the Franciscans, he does so by subscribing to
&ldquo;a quite different theoretical framework, both on the level of
ecclesiology and of political theory in general&rdquo; (Lambertini
2012: 263). Marsilius&rsquo; position on natural right, which closely
echoes Aristotle, is a typical example of this same attitude.
Marsilius does not accept the distinction between positive law and
natural right, a distinction common in the Franciscan tradition
(Lambertini 2012, 261). As Lambertini points out, his silence on this
topic &ldquo;is telling and reveals once again his mistrust toward the
notion of natural law&rdquo; and his intention to defend Franciscan
ideas without any recourse to Franciscan notions of natural law
(Lambertini 2012, 262).</p>

<h3 id="IdeNatRig">6.3. The Idea of Natural Right</h3>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; theory of natural right reflects his radically
distinctive understanding of the relationship between divine and human
law and human acts, as previously discussed. In Chapter 12 of the
second Discourse, Marsilius provides two different definitions of
natural right. He first argues that natural right is something
&ldquo;upon which almost all agree as something honest that should be
observed&rdquo; (DP, 253). According to a second account, however,
natural right is a &ldquo;dictate of right reason&rdquo; that falls
under divine law. Marsilius clearly rejects the first account of
natural right, writing that he considers it &ldquo;equivocal&rdquo;
because &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in this context means
&ldquo;conventional&rdquo; (DP, 254). As for the second view of
natural right, Marsilius&rsquo; position is more ambiguous. Although
he appears to suggest that, in this case as well, the phrase natural
right could be considered equivocal&mdash;presenting something
conventional as natural&mdash;he immediately adds that natural right
as a &ldquo;dictate of reason&rdquo; is useful in distinguishing
between what is licit and illicit &ldquo;in absolute terms&rdquo; (DP,
254). Marsilius defines &ldquo;licit&rdquo; as &ldquo;everything that
has been done according to a command or permission of the law or
omitted according to a prohibition or permission of the law&rdquo;
(DP, 252), while &ldquo;its contrary or opposite&rdquo; is termed
&ldquo;illicit&rdquo;. To illustrate this view, Marsilius refers to
cases in which prohibitions and permissions deemed licit under human
laws are patently illicit under divine law. In such cases, he
explains, &ldquo;what is licit and illicit in absolute terms should be
understood according to divine law rather than human&rdquo;. In fact,
Marsilius acknowledges that absolute notions of &ldquo;licit&rdquo;
and &ldquo;illicit&rdquo; play an important role in assessing moral
behavior in earthly life. However, unlike Aquinas, Marsilius strips
the idea of natural right of any decisive role in the formulation of
human laws (Costa 2023). For him, an extra-juridical standard for
judging human action holds only limited political significance. This
is because&mdash;just as in the case of Christian law&rsquo;s judgment
concerning deliberate &ldquo;immanent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;transitive&rdquo; acts&mdash;punishments for transgressions and
prohibitions grounded in natural right, and therefore in absolute
notions of &ldquo;licit&rdquo; and &ldquo;illicit,&rdquo; can be
enforced only in the afterlife by the supreme judge, Christ (Brett
2006; Costa 2023). This position makes clear that such punishments
cannot be carried out in earthly life unless they are authorized by
the human legislator (Lewis 1963; Nederman 1995a), which, as Marsilius
explains in Chapter 12 of the first Discourse, is &ldquo;the
people&rdquo; or the &ldquo;universal body of citizens&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; position is particularly original within the context
of medieval political thought (Brett 2005; Hamilton-Bleakley 2007).
Yet, interpreters have disagreed on the sources of Marsilius&rsquo;
position. For some, the roots of this position are to be found in
Aristotle&rsquo;s thought (Brett 2005). Cary Nederman has emphasized
the link between Marsilius&rsquo; ideas on natural right and
Cicero&rsquo;s views on the subject, also connecting it to
Marsilius&rsquo; evocation of a &ldquo;quasi-natural&rdquo; law, which
consists of a &ldquo;certain duty of human society&rdquo; (DP, 16), in
the first part of the <em>Defender</em> (Nederman 2020:
111&ndash;112). Other interpreters have studied the complex
relationship between Marsilius and Aquinas&rsquo; positions on natural
law (Brett 2006; Costa 2023; Hamilton-Bleakly 2007). The strong
similarities between Marsilius&rsquo; position and Averroes&rsquo;
ideas in his commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> have also
been underlined (Mulieri 2023a; Strauss 1953). This commentary had
been translated into Latin by Hermannus Alemannus in the 13th century,
and there is evidence of its presence in 13th-century Paris (Gauthier
1959: 117 and 123; Costa 2008).</p>

<p>
Regardless of its origins, Marsilius&rsquo;s position on natural right
must be understood in relation to his theory of collective prudence.
As we have seen, in the <em>Defender</em>, he asserts that the
theoretical foundation of human laws lies in a collective and
epistemic conception of prudence (Mulieri 2023b; Nardi 1960; Syros
2007a; 2007b). Interpreting this claim in light of his stance on
natural right&mdash;particularly his assertion that natural right has
limited or no value in determining what is licit and illicit within
the polity&mdash;further clarifies his broader legal and political
framework. Indeed, Marsilius replaces natural right with his theory of
collective prudence, which he regards as the sole source of legitimacy
for human laws. This move may have been politically motivated. As
Mulieri explains, &ldquo;grounding human laws on natural law (which so
often depended on divine law) could easily lend itself to being used
as an argument in favour of the relevance of ecclesiastical power for
the determination of temporal power&rdquo;, thereby indirectly
supporting claims in favor of the plenitude of power (Mulieri 2023:
556). Conversely, by basing the legitimacy of human laws on a
collective theory of prudence rather than on natural right, Marsilius
provides an entirely human foundation for political authority and
legal legitimacy in the polity he describes in the
<em>Defender</em>.</p>

<h3 id="EccSpiTemPow">6.4 Ecclesiology: Spiritual and Temporal Power</h3>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo; attack on the plenitude of power leads him to develop
highly original ideas regarding the concept of the Church and the role
of the Council in the second Discourse. When discussing the Church, he
begins by conducting a complex semantic analysis of the various
meanings of this notion that were prevalent in his time. He argues
that, based on its original Greek meaning, in its first and second
senses, the term Church refers to &ldquo;a gathering of a people
contained under one single government&rdquo; (DP, 144) and a
&ldquo;temple or house in which the faithful worship God as a
community and most often pray to him&rdquo; (DP, 144&ndash;145). A
third meaning identifies the Church with &ldquo;all the priests or
bishops, deacons, and other ministers of the temple or church in the
previous signification,&rdquo; (DP 144) while a fourth meaning more
specifically refers to the ecclesiastical ministries of the Church of
Rome, including the Pope and the cardinals. Finally, Marsilius
provides his own definition of the Church, which he describes as the
&ldquo;truest and most proper of all according to the original
application of the term or the intention of those who originally
applied it&rdquo; (DP, 144). According to this definition, the Church
is the &ldquo;universal body of faithful believers who call upon the
name of Christ, and of all the parts of this body within any
community, even the household&rdquo; (DP, 144). With this formulation,
Marsilius presents a vision of the Church that is not hierarchical but
horizontal, as it centers on the community of the faithful rather than
the traditional ecclesiastical structures of the Roman Church in his
time, with the Pope as its head. In fact, George Garnett has argued
that Marsilius&rsquo; definition reflects the Church as it existed
before Constantine&rsquo;s conversion and demonstrates a
&ldquo;selective&rdquo; use of Canon Law sources to show that, even
after Constantine, the Church had not become a &ldquo;papal
monarchy,&rdquo; as it became at a later stage (Garnett 2006: 189).
This aligns well with Michael Sweeney&rsquo;s characterization of
Marsilius&rsquo; Church as an entity that, although it exists in the
earthly world and maintains some relationship with temporal power, has
its ultimate purpose in the heavenly world. (Sweeney 2012: 181).</p>

<p>
To better situate these positions, Marsilius examines the question of
what kind of power Christ, who first established the Church in earthly
life, granted to Peter and the Apostles at the very beginning of
Christian history. Drawing on various arguments traditionally used by
both sides in earlier disputes over the political characterization of
ecclesiastical power (Briguglia 2013), Marsilius asserts that Christ
explicitly subjected himself to the jurisdiction of civil power, as
made clear by several Scriptural passages. According to Marsilius,
Christ also submitted to the civil jurisdiction of Pilate&rsquo;s
trial. In fact, as explained by him, &ldquo;Christ in his purposed
intention, words and actions wanted to and did exclude himself and the
apostles from the office of prince or of contentious jurisdiction,
government or coercive judgement of whatever sort in this world&rdquo;
(DP, 161). Therefore, Christ never granted civil or coercive
jurisdiction to the Apostles, Peter, or any other priest or bishop.
This means that the power Christ conferred upon the Apostles and the
early Church was not coercive in temporal terms but purely spiritual.
As a result, the canonical laws of the Church and the decisions made
by priests, bishops, and other ecclesiastical ministers hold only
consultative, not binding, authority over civil and political matters.
As he had already explained in the first Discourse (Chapter 6),
Marsilius reiterates in the second Discourse that priests and members
of the clergy fulfil an important moral and public function by guiding
believers on the path to salvation. The Paduan describes priests as
&ldquo;physicians of the soul&rdquo; and claims that &ldquo;by
analogy&rdquo; with the physician, a &ldquo;priest judges and exhorts
concerning those things that lead to the eternal health of the soul or
to its eternal death or temporal penalty for the status of the world
to come. But he neither can nor should hold anyone to such things by
coercive power in this world&rdquo; (DP, 211). Therefore, punishments
related to sins, stemming from the moral counsel of priests, are akin
to a physician&rsquo;s recommendations for healing&mdash;they are
advisory rather than politically binding unless explicitly adopted and
enforced by a civil or political authority.</p>

<h3 id="HerExcMarCon">6.4. Heresy, Excommunication and Marsilius&rsquo; Conciliarism</h3>

<p>
The same reasoning can be applied to how Marsilius theorizes heresy
and excommunication. According to him, while ecclesiastical
authorities certainly have a say in determining who counts as a
heretic or who should be excommunicated, it is up to the civil and
political authority to confirm and enforce this decision (DP,
455&ndash;459). Without this civil and coercive endorsement, decisions
of the clergy on excommunication and heresy remain ineffective and
politically irrelevant. In fact, as shown by Bettina Koch, while in
<em>Defender</em> heresy remains a crime that can be punished,
clergymen may participate in a trial for heresy only as advisors and
experts, while final judgments can be passed only by the coercive
secular judge, namely the legislator or the prince mandated by the
legislator (Koch 2012: 165). Moreover, Canon Law, for Marsilius, does
not come with coercive power unless the human legislator decides to
grant it such power, because it is not a set of laws that have been
established by the human legislator. For Marsilius, insofar as we can
speak of a priestly power, this is the &ldquo;the power of performing
the sacrament of the eucharist or body and blood of Christ, and also
the power of binding or loosing men from their sin&rdquo; (DP, 312).
This power should instead be distinguished from the jurisdiction that
certain bishops or ecclesiastical authorities exercise over a
particular territory. While at the beginning of Church history these
two powers were not clearly differentiated, over time they became
entirely distinct, and the power of priests to perform the sacrament
of the Eucharist no longer bore any direct relationship to
jurisdictional authority.</p>

<p>
At the core of Marsilius&rsquo;s ecclesiological theory in the
<em>Defender</em> lies a particularly original conception of the
Council. Traditionally, the Council was understood as a gathering of
bishops and other ecclesiastical authorities convened to decide
matters of doctrine and church administration. In contrast, Marsilius
envisions the Council as a &ldquo;general assembly&rdquo; of all the
Christian faithful, representing &ldquo;through succession, the
gathering of the apostles and other elders of the faithful at that
time&rdquo; (DP, 361). The starting point of Marsilius&rsquo;
reflection on this issue concerns the correct interpretation of the
Holy Scriptures. Marsilius asserts that this interpretation should
rest with the general Council of human believers&mdash;an assembly
first convened by the Council of Apostles at the beginning of
Christian history and which should continue to serve as the ultimate
reference point for decisions regarding the interpretation of the Holy
Scriptures. This assembly, which is &ldquo;the general Council&rdquo;
of the faithful (DP 203; 358) rather than the Pope or the Roman
clergy, must also have the authority to decide on complex
ecclesiastical matters such as heresy, excommunication, and similar
issues. Marsilius further states that &ldquo;the provinces and
communities of the world elect this Council&rdquo; but &ldquo;in
accordance with the decision of their human legislator (be it single
or several)&rdquo; (DP 134). According to him, all the provinces of
the world should elect a number of notables, priests, and laymen, who
would then convene in a designated location to discuss what is
necessary, appropriate, or uncertain regarding divine law. The members
of the Council can make decisions concerning divine law. However, it
would once again fall to the human legislator to transform the
decisions of the Council into human laws and enforce them. This
mechanism should not be interpreted through the lens of modern
concepts of the separation of Church and State, but should instead be
understood within the context of late medieval thought. In fact, as
explained by Bettina Koch, Marsilius&rsquo; conciliarism &ldquo;is not
concerned to introduce a clear separation between Church and state, to
use modern terminology. Indeed, he wants to integrate the Church into
the secular state&rdquo; (Koch 2012: 171).</p>

<h2 id="DefMinDeTraImpMarPolTheEmp">7. The <em>Defensor Minor</em> and <em>De Translatione Imperii</em>. Marsilius&rsquo; Political Theory of Empire</h2>

<p>
Marsilius also authored a short treatise of 12 chapters called <em>De
translatione imperii</em>. He announces the composition of this work
in the last chapter of the second Discourse of the <em>Defender</em>
(DP, 540). This treatise deals with a question that was quite typical
in Marsilius&rsquo; context, i.e., the theme of the transfer of empire
from the Romans to the Byzantines and then to the Franks and the
Germans. The text largely reflects Landolfo Colonna&rsquo;s pro-papal
treatise <em>Tractatus de statu et mutatione imperii,</em> which was a
work that Landolfo wrote in support of the role of the papacy in this
transfer of empire (Briguglia 2012; Nederman 1995b). Marsilius&rsquo;
text modifies Landolfo&rsquo;s in some key passages with the aim of
turning his treatise into a defence of the prerogatives of the empire.
Marsilius&rsquo; presentation of this problem aims to defend the idea
that none of the transfers of empire took place because of decisions
of the clergy or the papacy but were the result of decisions made by
human legislators.</p>

<p>
Another work by Marsilius is the <em>Defensor Minor</em>, the
composition date of which is likely 1340, though this remains a
subject of scholarly debate. This short treatise reiterates some ideas
that he had already explored in the <em>Defender of Peace</em> (with
numerous quotations from the latter work). However, in this treatise,
Marsilius&rsquo; pro-Empire stance becomes even more pronounced
compared to the <em>Defender</em> (Briguglia 2012; Nederman 1995b).
There are three main differences between the <em>Defensor Minor</em>
and the <em>Defender of Peace</em>. First, in the former, Marsilius
explicitly interprets his theory of the legislator as echoing the idea
of the <em>lex regia de imperio</em>, referring to the legislator not
simply as the people or the whole body of citizens but specifically as
the Roman people (<em>populus romanus</em>). Second, unlike in the
<em>Defender</em>, in <em>Defensor Minor</em> Marsilius appears to
conflate the concepts of the legislator and the emperor (Briguglia
2012). In fact, according to him, it is not the legislator, as in the
<em>Defender</em>, but the emperor who has the authority to convene
the Council. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the <em>Defensor
Minor</em> may also serve as a response to William of Ockham&rsquo;s
ideas on the Council (Briguglia 2012). While the latter denied the
infallibility of the Council, Marsilius regarded this body as
infallible, arguing that Truth emerges through dialogue among
individual believers of the same faith and as a result of the workings
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h2 id="MarRec">8. Marsilius&rsquo; Reception</h2>

<p>
The spread of Marsilius&rsquo; ideas was considerable, especially
during the age of the Wars of Religion, when his anti-papal
message&mdash;particularly in the second Discourse&mdash;was adopted
by several Protestants who were attacking the political and
theological prerogatives of the Roman Church and the Pope. It is no
accident that the first edition of <em>Defensor Pacis</em> was
published in Basel in 1522, with several other editions following
during the 16th and 17th centuries, notably in Germany. An English
translation was completed by William Marshall for Thomas Cromwell in
1535. Several papalist Counter-Reformation texts attacked
Marsilius&rsquo; doctrine in the <em>Defender</em> (often without
reading it), and by 1559, the text had been placed on the <em>Index of
Prohibited Books</em> (<em>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</em>) in Rome.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, some scholars were primarily
interested in the political ideas contained in the first Discourse of
the <em>Defender</em>, sometimes interpreting Marsilius&rsquo;
concepts of the people, representation, government, and human law
through modern and anachronistic lenses. More recently, the study of
Marsilius&rsquo; reception has experienced a revival. Scholars have
examined the influence of his thought in 16th- and 17th-century
England (Izbiky 2012; Simonetta 2000a,b), in Althusius and Hobbes
(Koch 2005, 2006; Simonetta 2000a,b), in Italian Renaissance and early
modern political thought (Condren 1980; Masolini 2023; Piaia 1977), as
well as his presence in contemporary contexts&mdash;for example, in
the <em>Third Reich</em> (Godthardt 2023) or in contemporary political
theory and philosophy (Mulieri 2021a; Nederman 2023; Piaia 2023;
Vatter 2020). Nevertheless, the influence of Marsilius&rsquo; ideas
remains a decidedly underdeveloped area of research that deserves more
attention compared to other topics in Marsilius studies.</p>
