<h1>Branching Time</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Apr 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
<em>Branching time</em> (BT) is a multipurpose label, which is mainly
used to denote (i) a family of structures (BT representations or BT
frames), possibly along with the axiomatic theories defining them,
(ii) a family of semantics for temporal and modal logics (BT
semantics); and (iii) a metaphysical conception concerning our
universe and its temporal and modal features (branching conception of
time or BT conception).</p>

<p>
In very general terms, a <em>BT representation</em> is a complex of
<em>histories</em> (or <em>chronicles</em>, or <em>possible
worlds</em>) and <em>moments</em> (or <em>nodes</em>), which purports
to represent all possible temporal developments of a given system.
Intuitively, histories stand for temporally complete (possible)
developments of the system, and moments, for their minimal temporal
&ldquo;slices&rdquo;. Unlike non-branching modal structures, BT
representations allow different histories to <em>overlap</em> or
<em>coincide</em> over a certain stretch of time and then
<em>divide</em> or
 <em>branch</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 <em>BT frames</em> are mathematical structures that purport to
provide BT representations, i.e., they are formally defined BT
representations. In this entry, we shall primarily focus on
<em>standard</em> BT frames or <em>trees</em> (see
 <a href="#figtree">Fig. 1</a>).</p>
 
<div class="figure center" id="figtree">

<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> A tree, where
\(h_0\)&ndash;\(h_3\) are histories and \(m_0\)&ndash;\(m_6\) are
moments. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#figtree">extended description of figure 1</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Standard BT frames are formal tools that can be applied to a variety
of different purposes, but two of their applications play a central
role in philosophy and deserve to be called <em>canonical</em>. They
are also the applications in view of which the frames were initially
introduced and developed, by Saul Kripke and Arthur Prior.</p>

<p>
The first canonical application is in defining a family of semantics
for tense-modal logics, now known as <em>branching time
semantics</em>, which have been independently developed in
philosophical logic and computer science. BT semantics have
considerable philosophical interest, for instance in the analysis of
historical modality and the treatment of future contingent
statements.</p>

<p>
The second canonical application is in modeling a very special system,
namely our (supposedly) indeterministic, agent-populated, universe.
The <em>BT conception</em> is the view that our universe and its
temporal and modal features are better represented by standard BT
frames than by other, non-tree-like structures. Given that there are
different ways to conceive trees and how they represent reality, the
BT conception is best regarded as a family of metaphysical views,
which need not share a substantive metaphysical core. Nonetheless, the
BT conception is neither empty nor trivial, as whether trees are
better suited to representing our universe than alternative structures
is a matter of legitimate philosophical disagreement.</p>

<h2 id="PriBraTim">1. A primer to branching time</h2>

<p>
Branching time (BT) frames are formally defined BT representations,
and are endowed with both structural and representational features.
From a structural viewpoint, BT frames are <em>branching
structures</em>, that is, intuitively, networks of interconnected
paths, where each path can be thought of as a chain of nodes.
Branching structures are ubiquitous in our experience, appearing for
instance in trees, in rivers, in circulatory systems, and in road
systems. What makes BT frames special, with respect to other branching
structures, is their representational function: BT frames aim to
represent all the possible temporal developments of a given system,
which in philosophy is generally identified with the whole universe.
More specifically, in BT frames, paths are called <em>histories</em>
and represent complete courses of events, while nodes are called
<em>moments</em> and represent instantaneous or temporally minimal
events. Histories are usually defined as maximal chains of moments
ordered by a relation of <em>temporal</em> (or <em>causal</em>, or
<em>temporal-modal</em>) <em>precedence</em> \(\prec\). Histories are
all connected: by moving backward and/or forward along histories, we
can reach any moment in the frame from any other. Histories can branch
out in both temporal direction, that is, we can have both
future-directed or <em>forward</em> branching and past-directed or
<em>backward</em> branching (see
 <a href="#figbranching">Fig. 2</a>).
 We shall speak of <em>standard</em> BT frames or (BT)
 <em>trees</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 to indicate BT frames in which only forward branching is admitted and
backward branching is not. In this entry, we shall focus on trees and
devote only a few passing comments to backward-branching BT
frames.</p>

<div class="figure center" id="figbranching">
<img alt="A diagram showing both a forward branching and a backward branching tree. Link to extended description below" src="Branching.svg" style="width:18em" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2:</span> Forward branching and backward
branching. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#figbranching">extended description of figure 2</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
In short, standard BT frames or trees are <em>abstract
representations</em> that are understood to represent our universe (or
some other system) along with all its possible developments; trees are
complexes of <em>moments</em> and <em>histories</em>, where histories
are maximal chains of temporally ordered moments; histories are all
<em>connected</em> and <em>do not branch towards the past</em>. Let us
expand on this characterization by delving a little deeper into each
of these italicized notions.</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Abstract representations.</strong> BT frames are generally
thought of as abstract representations, which need not be fully
projected onto reality. The problem of making clear what precisely
they represent is a major philosophical concern, which we shall
discuss in
 <a href="#PhiVieBraTim">&sect;4</a>.</li>
 
<li><strong>Moments.</strong> Moments represent events that are
spatially maximal and only have an instantaneous or minimal duration.
Trees are commonly defined as pairs \((M,\prec\)), where \(M\) is a
non-empty set of moments and the temporal precedence relation
\(\prec\) is a strict partial order that complies with the principles
of <em>Connection</em> and <em>No backward branching</em> (see
below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
As Belnap, Perloff, and Xu observe,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the concept of a moment &hellip; is a Newtonian idea. It is distant
from our everyday conceptions, and it is non-relativistic. It inherits
from Laplace&rsquo;s demon the implausible presupposition that the
fundamental terms of the causal order shall be entire instantaneous
world-slices, instead of smallish local events or point events. It is,
however, a worthwhile approximation to the truth. (2001: 139)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idealization is removed in branching-spacetimes frames (BST
frames, see Belnap 1992; Belnap, M&uuml;ller, &amp; Placek 2022),
where the role of moments as basic building blocks is taken by
spatially smaller events (see below,
 <a href="#RepBraSpaTim">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#BraTimReaBraSpaTimRea">&sect;4.1.1</a>).</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Histories.</strong> Each history represents a
<em>spatially and temporally complete, possible course of events</em>.
Histories are usually defined as maximal sets of moments, linearly (or
totally) ordered by \(\prec\).</li>

<li><strong>Connection.</strong> For any two distinct moments in the
frame, either one precedes the other or there is a moment that is
\(\prec\)-related with both. Intuitively, this means that the whole
frame forms a single, connected structure of histories.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Connection reflects the idea that BT frames model the possible
evolutions of a unified system, and not a plenitude of disjoint
possibilities.</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<strong>No backward branching.</strong> If two different moments
\(m,m'\) temporally precede another moment \(w\), then \(m\) and
\(m'\) are \(\prec\)-related, which implies that they belong to every
history containing \(w\). In other words, the past of every moment is
a linear order.</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Historically, No backward branching reflects the philosophical
motivations behind the introduction of BT representations. In 1958, a
very young Saul Kripke wrote a letter to Arthur Prior where he
provided the first semi-formal characterization of BT frames
(Kripke&rsquo;s letter, dated 3 September 1958, is in the Prior
Collection at Bodleian Library, Oxford, Box 4; see the entry on
 <a href="../future-contingents/">future contingents</a>
 for more historical background). Prior took Kripke&rsquo;s suggestion
very seriously, and formally developed it during the 1960s (1960,
1962, 1966a,b, 1967a,b, 1968a,b). He saw BT frames as a useful tool in
a variety of logico-philosophical areas: the semantics of tense-modal
logics, the problem of identity across time and possible worlds, the
problems of agency, free will, and future contingents. In all these
areas, Prior felt that too little attention was paid, among
philosophers and logicians, to the fact that possibilities change
across time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is always a useful exercise (and one insufficiently practiced by
philosophers), when told that something was possible, i.e., could have
happened, to ask &ldquo;<em>When</em> was it possible?&rdquo;
&ldquo;<em>When</em> could it have happened?&rdquo; (Prior 1960:
688)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contemporary philosophical jargon, the kind of time-sensitive
modalities (possibilities, necessities, contingencies) that Prior had
in mind are called <em>historical</em>. Historical modality is time
asymmetrical: all past and present events are historically necessary,
and only future events are historically contingent. For this reason,
historically contingent events are also called <em>future
contingents</em>. (With a traditional ambiguity, we use &ldquo;future
contingents&rdquo; also to indicate assertions that predict future
contingent events and the corresponding sentences.) Along with
historical possibilities, which are anchored to a time, one can also
conceive possibilities that are anchored to a space-time region or to
certain agents. These &ldquo;local&rdquo; possibilities are sometimes
called <em>real</em> (see, e.g., M&uuml;ller 2012; Placek 2012;
Rumberg 2016a; Belnap, M&uuml;ller, Placek 2022). BST frames are tools
for formally studying real
 possibilities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Intuitively, historical and real contingencies are the kinds of
possibilities that matter to us as agents. In an abstract sense, it is
now possible that you never started reading this entry. However, given
that you <em>did</em> start reading this entry, that is no longer a
live possibility. By contrast, it is still a genuine possibility for
you to stop reading this entry. It is difficult to overestimate the
role of the distinction between abstract (metaphysical, logical)
modality and historical (real, &ldquo;local&rdquo;) modality in our
self-representation as agents and in our inferential, epistemic and
linguistic practices. In Prior&rsquo;s view, the distinction is not
just a human construction and is also rooted in mind-independent
reality. Prior subscribed to indeterminism, and thought that at least
some particular events were <em>objectively</em> &ldquo;open&rdquo;,
not already present in their causes (see, e.g., Prior 1967a: Ch. 7;
see also the entry on
 <a href="../determinism-causal/">causal determinism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Many philosophers in the contemporary debate about branching time
agree with Prior in regarding historical modality as purely objective
(mind-independent) and grounded in concrete reality. They think there
is a deep divide between objective and <em>epistemic</em> modality,
and between particular, concrete events and <em>qualitative</em>,
repeatable states.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[N]o backward branching makes sense only for objective, concrete
events. [&hellip;] A given concrete situation could obviously have
been preceded by any of various inconsistent predecessors, &ldquo;for
all one knows&rdquo;. It is precisely to preclude this epistemic or
doxastic use of &ldquo;possible&rdquo; that we so tiresomely repeat
that our present concern is with &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
possibilities. Second, No backward branching fails to apply to
&ldquo;states&rdquo; or other repeatable carriers of partial
information. There is no doubt whatsoever that a present
&ldquo;state&rdquo; may be accessible from either of two earlier
incompatible states. (Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 184)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, the No backward branching condition reflects the idea that
whether an event \(e\) is historically possible at a moment \(m\)
entirely depends on whether \(e\) is causally-historically accessible
from \(m\) (i.e., lies either in the past or in a future of \(m\)).
Thus, the historical possibility of \(e\) at \(m\) does not depend on
whether \(e\) is compatible with the knowledge available at \(m\), or
whether other events similar to \(e\) are accessible from \(m\).</p>

<p>
When joined with Connection, No backward branching entails
<em>Historical connection</em>: for any two distinct moments in the
frame, either one precedes the other or there is a moment that
precedes both. The adoption of Historical connection has
philosophically interesting consequences. Let us make one of these
consequences explicit.</p>

<p>
Historical possibility is a very strict notion of possibility, and
within standard BT frames, we can also define more inclusive notions.
For one, we can define a notion of <em>past historical
possibility</em>: an event \(e\) is a past historical possibility at
\(m\) iff \(e\) is historically possible at some moment \(m'\) that
either precedes or is identical to \(m\). And we can define also an
absolute, tree-relative notion of possibility: an event \(e\) is
possible in a tree iff it is historically possible at some moment in
the tree. Historical connection ensures us that these two notions of
possibility coincide. By Historical connection, past historical
possibility is the widest, most inclusive notion of possibility
definable within BT frames.</p>

<p>
It is natural to suppose that the notion of past historical
possibility coincides with the notion of <em>physical possibility
given initial conditions</em>, when initial conditions are set
arbitrarily far in the past. Many philosophers think that physical
possibility, so understood, is still restrictive as compared to
<em>metaphysical</em> possibility, which is the widest notion of
possibility traditionally recognized in philosophy. If that is
correct, by adopting Historical connection, we make BT frames
unsuitable to model metaphysical modality (on the relations between BT
and metaphysical modality, see, e.g., Prior 1960; J. L. Mackie 1974;
Lewis 1986: 4; P. Mackie 2006; MacFarlane 2008).</p>

<h2 id="RepBraTim">2. Representations of branching time</h2>

<h3 id="TreBunTre">2.1 Trees. Bundled trees.</h3>

<p>
As observed above, trees are the most common representations of
branching time. These structures are formally defined as pairs
\({\mathcal{T}}= (T, \prec )\) in which \(T\) is a set (of
<em>moments</em>) and \(\prec\) is the <em>temporal precedence</em>
relation with the following properties (the expression \(m \prec m'\)
reads \(m\) <em>temporally precedes</em> \(m'\); \(\preceq\),
\(\succ\), and \(\succeq\) are defined in the obvious way; two moments
\(m,m'\) are said to be <em>comparable</em> when either \(m\preceq
m'\) or \(m'\prec m\)):</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Irreflexivitiy.</strong> For no \(m\), \(m \prec m\);</li>

<li><strong>Transitivity.</strong> If \(m \prec m'\) and \(m' \prec

<li><strong>Connection.</strong> For any two moments, there exists a

<li><strong>No backward branching (or Linearity towards the
past).</strong> If \(m' \prec m\) and \(m'' \prec m\), then either
\(m' \preceq m''\) or \(m'' \prec m'\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
No backward branching and Connection jointly entail the following:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<strong>Historical connection (or left-connectedness).</strong> For
all \(m\) and \(m'\), there exists an \(m''\) such that \(m'' \preceq
m\) and \(m''\preceq m'\).</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
A <em>history</em> in the tree \({\mathcal{T}}= (T, \prec )\) is a set
\(h \subseteq T\), which is linearly ordered by \(\prec\) and maximal
for inclusion, that is, if \(h'\) is a linearly ordered subset of
\(T\) and \(h \subseteq h'\), then \(h' = h\). It can be proved (with
the Axiom of Choice) that every linearly ordered subset of \(T\) can
be extended to a history. The <em>Future</em> of \(m\) is defined as
\(\{m' \in T : m \prec m'\}\). A <em>future</em> of \(m\) (or an
\(m\)-<em>branch</em>) is the intersection of the Future of \(m\) and
a history containing \(m\). The symmetrical notion of the
<em>past</em> of \(m\) (or \(m\)-<em>trunk</em>) is defined as \(\{m'
\in T : m' \prec m\}\).</p>

<p>
Connection entails that we can get from any moment to any other at
most in two (backward or forward) steps. If Connection is given up, we
get structures consisting of disjoint trees, which are sometimes
called <em>forests</em> (see, e.g., Goranko, Kellerman, &amp; Zanardo
2023).</p>

<p>
If No backward branching is omitted, then the only condition imposed
on the relation \(\prec\) is that it is an irreflexive connected
partial order. Thus, at any moment, time may branch out also in the
past and a BT structure can be viewed as a set of crossroads (see
 <a href="#figcrossroad">Fig. 3</a>).
 So conceived, crossroads are temporally directed, as we can divide
them into a forward-branching fork and a backward branching one. The
forward-branching fork departing from \(m\) is naturally understood to
represent the historical possibilities open at \(m\), and the
backward-branching fork, the <em>epistemic</em> possibilities open at
\(m\), i.e., the possibilities consistent with the knowledge available
at \(m\). However, other interpretations are also possible (e.g., we
can understand both forks as representing epistemic possibilities).
Backward branching structures have potential applications that are
largely unexplored to date, for instance, concerning the treatment of
knowledge and other propositional attitudes in a branching
 reality.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 We expect that in future iterations of this entry they will receive a
widest share of attention.</p>

<p>
In many applications of BT frames, it is of crucial importance that
some kind of synchronism is imposed between moments belonging to
different histories. For instance, counterfactual assertions seem to
involve a trans-history identification of moments: &ldquo;Were I in
London <em>now</em>, I would go straight to the British Museum&rdquo;
(see, e.g., Thomason &amp; Gupta 1980; Di Maio &amp; Zanardo 1994).
But it must be noticed that not every tree can be endowed with
synchronisms. The definition of tree does not impose any topological
structure on histories. We can have histories that are dense in some
parts and discrete in others. In particular, two different histories
may have different topological structures in the parts where they do
not overlap.</p>

<p>
When trees are viewed as representations of an indeterministic
universe, it is natural to assume that all histories are isomorphic to
the set \(\mathbb R\) of real numbers. In this case, given two
distinct histories \(h\) and \(h'\), also their set-theoretical
differences \(h \setminus h'\) and \(h' \setminus h\) are isomorphic
and any order-preserving bijection \(\sigma\) between these two sets
can be thought of as a <em>synchronism</em> between them. So we can
say that the tree is synchronizable. In other words, for any \(m \in
h\setminus h'\), \(\sigma(m)\) can be viewed as &ldquo;the same moment
as \(m\)&rdquo; in \(h' \setminus h\). It is important to observe that
\(h \setminus h'\) and \(h' \setminus h\) can be synchronized in
infinitely many ways. So, in general, in order to have a synchronized
tree, we must also explicitly provide a set of bijections between
histories.</p>

<p>
Formally, we say that the tree \({\mathcal{T}}\) is
<em>synchronizable</em> if there exists a set \(\Sigma\) of functions
\(\sigma_{h,h'}\), where \(h\) and \(h'\) range over the set of
histories in \({\mathcal{T}}\), such that, for all \(h, h', h''\): (1)
\(\sigma_{h,h'}\) is an order-preserving bijection from \(h\) onto
\(h'\), (2) \(\sigma_{h,h'}\) is the identity on \(h \cap h'\), (3)
\(\sigma_{h',h}\) is identical to \(\sigma^{-1}_{h,h'}\) (i.e., to the
inverse of \(\sigma_{h,h'}\)), and (4) the composition
\(\sigma_{h,h'}\circ\sigma_{h',h''}\) is identical to
\(\sigma_{h,h''}\). Pairs \(({\mathcal{T}}, \Sigma)\) are called
<em>synchronized</em>
 trees.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In a synchronized tree, the set \(\Sigma\) of bijections determines a
relation on \(T\): we can write \(m \leftrightarrow_\Sigma m'\) iff
\(m' = \sigma_{h,h'}(m)\) for some \(h, h'\). It can be readily
verified that, by the properties of the functions in \(\Sigma\), the
relation \(\leftrightarrow_\Sigma\) is well defined and is an
equivalence relation (see Di Maio &amp; Zanardo 1994), which is
naturally understood as a kind of simultaneity. The trees considered
in Belnap&rsquo;s Logic of Agency (in particular for achievement <span class="sans-serif">stit</span>)
are synchronized trees, but the
synchronism is determined by means of the primitive notion of
<em>instant</em> (Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 7A.5). The set of
moments in a tree is &ldquo;horizontally&rdquo; partitioned into
instants. Every instant is also assumed to have a unique intersection
with each history, and instants preserve the temporal relations
between moments (see
 <a href="#instants">Fig. 4</a>).
 It turns out that the equivalence relation determined by the
partition into instants has the same properties as
\(\leftrightarrow_\Sigma\). So, considering instants is the same as
considering a synchronism.</p>

<div class="figure center" id="instants">

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4:</span> Instants. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#instants">extended description of figure 4</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Another way for defining synchronisms is to consider metric trees
(Burgess 1979: 577). That is, to assume that there exists a function
\(d\) from \(T \times T\) into \(\mathbb{R}\) such that \(d(m,m')\)
can be viewed as the <em>distance</em> between \(m\) and \(m'\). If a
reference moment \(m_0\) is given, the function \(d\) can be seen as a
clock: \(d(m_0,m)\) is the (possibly negative) time of \(m\) with
respect to \(m_0\). Of course, some further technicalities are needed
in order to have a satisfactory definition of &ldquo;the time of the
moment \(m\)&rdquo;. For instance, we have to define this notion for
moments that are not comparable with \(m_0\). But eventually we can
reach a reasonable definition of synchronism.</p>

<p>
The existence of instants, as well as the existence of a synchronism,
in a tree-like representation of the universe is a strong ontological
assumption. This is actually recognized in Belnap, Perloff, and
Xu:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the doctrine of instants harkens back to the Newtonian doctrine of
absolute time&mdash;and therefore is suspect. We use it, but we
don&rsquo;t trust it. (2001: 194)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Improving on that is indeed one key motivation for Belnap&rsquo;s
theory of Branching Space-Times (see below,
 <a href="#RepBraSpaTim">&sect;2.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The notion of a tree is often generalized by considering <em>bundled
trees</em>, that is, pairs \(({\mathcal{T}}, {\mathcal{B}})\) in which
a <em>bundle</em> \({\mathcal{B}}\) is set of histories such that, for
each moment \(m\), some history in \({\mathcal{B}}\) includes \(m\).
Thus, trees can also be seen as <em>trivial</em> bundled trees
\(({\mathcal{T}}, {\mathcal{B}})\), in which \({\mathcal{B}}\) is the
set of all histories. Using non-trivial bundled trees as BT
representations amounts to holding that not every history represents a
possible course of events. In this sense, the set \({\mathcal{B}}\)
can be thought of as the set of <em>admissible</em> histories.</p>

<p>
There are two different attitudes one can have towards bundles and the
restriction to admissible histories. One can think, following van
Benthem (1996: 206&ndash;208), that since sets (histories) are
generally considered in a particular situation and with specific
purposes in mind, there is no reason to take <em>all</em> possible
sets (histories) into account; it is preferable to circumscribe the
range of the quantification over sets that is relevant to the purposes
at stake. An example of this way of proceeding can be found in
Stirling (1992), where interesting (first-order and second-order)
closure properties are identified for the set of branches (or paths,
or runs, or histories) in temporal logic for computer science.</p>

<p>
The opposite attitude, based on descriptive adequacy, is instead
advocated by Thomason (1984: 151&ndash;152) and Belnap, Perloff, and
Xu (2001: 200&ndash;203). These authors argue that bundled trees lead
to contradictory assertions when certain specific indeterministic
scenarios are considered. For a reply to their arguments, see
&Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (1995: 268&ndash;269), and the entry
on
 <a href="../future-contingents/">future contingents</a>,
 &sect;5.2, which discuss structures (&ldquo;Leibnizian
systems&rdquo;) very similar to Kamp frames or Ockhamist frames (see
below,
 <a href="#NonBraRep">&sect;2.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A further kind of BT representations is the one that van Benthem
(1999) calls <em>geometrical</em>. In the geometrical approach, both
moments and histories are regarded as primitive entities, with no
set-theoretical and ontological dependence of the latter on the
former, in the same way as points and lines are regarded in many
presentations of geometry. In this approach, histories are
<em>reified</em>. Then, unlike in standard, moment-based perspectives,
geometrical representations treat moments and histories on a
 par.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 A <em>geometrical structure</em> is a 4-tuple \(\mathcal{G} = (T,H,
\prec, E)\) in which \(T\) and \(H\) are sets, \(\prec\) is a tree
relation on \(T\), and \(E\) is a binary relation between \(T\) and
\(H\). The elements of \(H\) are meant to represent histories and
\(E(m,h)\) can be read as &ldquo;the moment \(m\) lies on
\(h\)&rdquo;. The (first-order) properties of these structures given
in Zanardo (2006b: Def. 6.1) have the effect that the elements of
\(H\) actually represent histories: it turns out that, for every \(h
\in H\), the set \(\bar h = \{m \in T : E(m,h)\}\) is a history in
\((T, \prec)\). Moreover, the set of all \(\bar h\), for \(h\) ranging
over \(H\), is a bundle in that tree.</p>

<h3 id="NonBraRep">2.2 Non-branching representations</h3>

<p>
Other modal structures for representing indeterministic systems can be
found in the literature. These can be termed <em>non-branching
representations</em>, as they are naturally thought to represent
disjoint worlds rather than overlapping courses of events. As we shall
see below, there is a strict connection between these structures and
bundled trees. This allows, for example, to use either the former or
the latter interchangeably in the semantics for branching time logics
(see
 <a href="#BraTimSemForTenModLog">&sect;3</a>).
 However, even if equivalent to bundled trees for many logical and
mathematical purposes, non-branching structures seem to reflect
different philosophical conceptions of historical modality and future
indeterminacy (see, e.g., Belnap, M&uuml;ller, &amp; Placek 2022;
6&ndash;8, 13&ndash;22; Restall 2011: 228&ndash;231).</p>

<p>
A <strong>Kamp frame</strong> (Thomason 1984) is a triple
\(\mathcal{K} = ({\mathsf{K}}, W, \approx)\) in which \(W\) is a set
of <em>worlds</em> and \({\mathsf{K}}\) is a function assigning a
linear order \({\mathsf{K}}_w = (T_w, \lt_w)\) to each element of
\(W\). Thus, every \({\mathsf{K}}_w\) can be regarded as a history.
This implies that the elements of each \(T_w\) can be viewed as
moments in a temporal structure. The branching aspect of time is
represented by \(\approx\), which is a function that assigns to each
moment \(t \in \bigcup_{w \in W}T_w\) an equivalence relation
\(\approx_t\) on the set of all worlds \(w\) such that \(t \in T_w\).
The intended meaning of \(w \approx_t w'\) is that the histories
\({\mathsf{K}}_w\) and \({\mathsf{K}}_{w'}\) coincide up to \(t\).
Then, it is also required that: (1) if \(w \approx_t w'\), then \(\{t'
\in T_w : t' \lt_w t \} = \{t' \in T_{w'} : t' \lt_{w'} t \}\) and (2)
if \(w \approx_t w'\) and \(t' \lt_w t\), then \(w \approx_{t'}
w'\).</p>

<p>
The definition of Kamp frame makes evident the relationship between
these structures and trees. Given a Kamp frame \(\mathcal{K} =
({\mathsf{K}}, W, \approx)\), the set of equivalence classes \([(w,t)]
= \{(w',t) : w \approx_t w'\}\) can be endowed with a binary relation
\(\prec_{\mathcal{K}}\) defined by</p> 
\[[(w,t)] \prec_{\mathcal{K}} [(w',t')] \hbox{ iff } w \approx_{t'} w' \hbox{ and } t \lt_{w'} t'\]

<p>
(cf. Zanardo 2006b: 4). It can be easily verified that
\(\prec_{\mathcal{K}}\) is well-defined and is a tree relation. Then,
the classes \([(w,t)]\) can be viewed as moments in a tree
\({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\). Moreover, for any \(w\) in \(W\), the
set \(\{ [(w,t)] : t \in T_w \}\) turns out to be a history \(h_w\) in
\({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\).</p>

<p>
Trees generate Kamp frames in a natural way. Given a tree
\({\mathcal{T}}\), we let \(W_{\mathcal{T}}\) be the set of all
histories in \({\mathcal{T}}\) and let \(\approx_{\mathcal{T}}\) be
the identity function
 (<a href="#Tree-Kamp">Fig. 5</a>).
 For all histories \(h, h'\in W_{\mathcal{T}}\) and all moments \(m
\in T\), we set \(h \approx_{{\mathcal{T}}m} h'\) iff \(m \in h \cap
h'\). The proof that \(\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}}=
({\mathsf{K}}_{\mathcal{T}}, W_{\mathcal{T}}, \approx_{\mathcal{T}})\)
is a Kamp frame is straightforward.</p>

Kamp frame. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#Tree-Kamp">extended description of figure 5</a>

</div>

<p>
Despite the close relationship between trees and Kamp frames, the
correspondences \(\mathcal{K} \to {\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\) and
\({\mathcal{T}}\to \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}}\) are not the inverse
(modulo isomorphisms) of each other. In general, the structure
\(\mathcal{K}_{({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}})}\) is not isomorphic to
\(\mathcal{K}\) because \({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\) might have
histories that do not correspond to any world in \(\mathcal{K}\) (cf.
Zanardo 2006b). The set of histories of the form \(h_w\) in
\({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\) constitute a possibly proper bundle in
this tree. It is true, instead, that
\({\mathcal{T}}_{(\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}})}\) is isomorphic to
\({\mathcal{T}}\).</p>

<p>
<strong>\(\mathbf{T\times W}\) frames</strong> can be defined as Kamp
frames in which \({\mathsf{K}}_w = {\mathsf{K}}_{w'}\) for all \(w, w'
\in W\). Thus, what we said above about the correspondence between
Kamp frames and trees also holds for \(\mathrm{T\times W}\) frames. It
must be noted that the trees generated by these frames are
synchronized trees. Given a \(\mathrm{T\times W}\) frame
\(\mathcal{K}\), for any two histories \(h_w\) and \(h_{w'}\) in
\({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{K}}\), we define the function
\(\sigma_{w,w'}\) by \(\sigma_{w,w'}([(w,t)]) = [(w',t)]\). It is
readily verified that the set of all \(\sigma_{w,w'}\) is a
synchronism.</p>

<p>
The <strong>Ockhamist frames</strong> have been introduced in Zanardo
(1985) and further investigated in Zanardo (1996). Intuitively,
Ockhamist frames can be viewed as deriving from a tree by considering
the histories in it as disjoint sets, each one linearly ordered by a
relation \(\lt\), and by representing the sameness of moments by an
equivalence relation \(\sim\). Formally, an Ockhamist frame is a
triple \(\mathcal{O} =(W, \lt, \sim)\) in which \(W\) is a non-empty
set and \(\lt\) and \(\sim\) are binary relations on \(W\) with the
following properties: (1) \(\lt\) and \(\sim\) are disjoint (\(w \lt
w' \Rightarrow w \not\sim w'\)); (2) \(\lt\) is a union of disjoint
linear orders; (3) \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation; (4) if \(w
\sim w'\), then the restriction of \(\sim\) to \(\{ w'' : w'' \lt w\}
\times \{ w'' : w'' \lt w'\}\) is an order-preserving bijection.</p>

<p>
The set of pairs \((m,h)\) with \(m \in h\) in a tree
\({\mathcal{T}}\) can be given an Ockhamist frame structure by setting
\((m,h) \lt (m', h')\) if \(h=h'\) and \(m \prec m'\), and \((m,h)
\sim (m', h')\) if \(m=m'\). The frame defined in this way will be
denoted by \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{T}}\)
 (<a href="#Tree-Ock">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>
Conversely, given an Ockhamist frame \(\mathcal{O} =(W, \lt, \sim)\)
we can define a tree \({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{O}}\) in a natural way.
The moments in this tree are equivalence classes \([w]_\sim\) and the
tree relation \(\prec\) is defined by: \([w]_\sim\prec [w']_\sim\) if
\(w'' \lt w'\) for some \(w'' \in [w] _\sim\). Property (4) above
guarantees that \(\prec\) is (well defined and) a tree relation. Every
\(\lt\)-connected component \(C\) of \(W\), that is, every maximal
subset \(C\) of \(W\) such that, for all \(w, w' \in C\), \(w \leq
w'\) or \(w' \leq w\), determines a history \(h_C = \{ [w]_\sim : w
\in C\}\). Like in the case of Kamp frames, the set of all \(h_C\) is
a bundle \({\mathcal{B}}\) in \({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{O}}\), so
that, in general, \(\mathcal{O}_{{\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{O}}}\) and
\(\mathcal{O}\) are not isomorphic structures (while
\({\mathcal{T}}_{\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{T}}}\) and \({\mathcal{T}}\)
are).</p>

<h3 id="RepBraSpaTim">2.3 Representations of Branching Space-Times</h3>

<p>
In Belnap (1992), Nuel Belnap set up the ambitious project of
combining relativity and indeterminism in a rigorous framework.
Various publications on the subject followed and developed that work,
including Belnap, M&uuml;ller, and Placek (2022), which summarizes
those developments in the form of a monograph. In this section, we
outline the main aspects of this innovative approach, also in
connection with the representations of branching time considered
above.</p>

<p>
The main goal of Branching Space-Times (BST) theory is to represent
possibilities in the context of relativity. Then, the basic notions in
the theory are those of (possible) <em>point event</em> and of
<em>causal order</em> relation (\(\lt\)), which are the BST
counterparts of moments and of the temporal order in BT. As clearly
pointed out in Belnap (2012), BST theory aims to move away from a
Newtonian framework in two different directions: from determinism to
indeterminism and from classical physics to relativity. This includes
paying attention to the relativistic notion of causal independence as
space-like separation (see below).</p>

<p>
A BST structure (<em>Our World</em>, in Belnap&rsquo;s terminology) is
then a pair \(\mathcal{W} = (W, \lt)\) in which \(W\) is a non-empty
set (of point events) and \(\lt\) is a strict partial order on \(W\)
(\(\leqslant\), \(\gt\), and \(\geqslant\) are defined in the obvious
way). If \(e_1 \leqslant e_2\) or \(e_2 \leqslant e_1\), we say that
\(e_1\) and \(e_2\) are <em>comparable</em>. The axioms for BST do not
include the linearity towards the past (while they imply density and
continuity of the causal order relation). Thus, unlike in BT, three
point events may constitute a <em>causal confluence</em> diagram:
\(e_1 \lt e_2 \gt e_3\) with \(e_1 \not\leqslant e_3\) and \(e_3
\not\leqslant e_1\). A consequence of this is that we can consider two
different kinds of <em>up-forks</em> \(e'_1 \gt e'_2 \lt e'_3\),
according to whether \(e'_1\) and \(e'_3\) are followed by causal
confluence or not.</p>

<div class="figure center" id="dispersion">
<img alt="Two diagrams, one each for causal dispersion and branching dispersion. Link to extended description below" src="BST_2.svg" style="width:17em" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 7:</span> Causal dispersion and
branching dispersion. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#dispersion">extended description of figure 7</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The branching of possibilities represented via BT does not allow for
backward branching, while relativistic space-time does. Then, in the
diagrams of the first kind (that Belnap calls <em>causal
dispersion</em>) the point events \(e'_1 , e'_2\) and \(e'_3\) must
belong to the same space-time, while the forks of the second kind
(<em>branching dispersion</em>) are given a strictly modal
meaning.</p>

<p>
These considerations directly lead to the notion of <em>history</em>,
which has a crucial role also in BST. Like in BT, a structure
consisting of just one history can be viewed as a representation of a
deterministic universe. Then, taking relativity into account, any two
point events \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) in a history \(h\) must have a
<em>later witness</em> in \(h\), that is, \(e_1 \leqslant e_3
\geqslant e_2\) must hold for some \(e_3 \in h\). Subsets of \(W\)
with this property are called <em>directed subsets</em>. Thus,
histories in BST are directed subsets of \(W\). They are also required
to be maximal, which implies that every history is downward closed and
(upward) closed for causal confluence. \(d\)-dimensional Minkowski
space-times with \(d \geq 2\) are examples of histories. Two point
events are said to be <em>compatible</em> if there is a history that
contains them.</p>

<p>
In general, histories in BST are not linearly ordered sets, but they
share many of the properties of histories in BT. In particular, every
directed subset of \(W\) can be extended to a history. Moreover, since
Historical connection is assumed in BST, any two histories have
non-empty intersection. The original axioms for BST in Belnap (1992)
imply also that the intersection of any two histories has a maximal
element, which is called <em>choice point</em>. As shown in Belnap,
M&uuml;ller, and Placek (2022), though, other alternatives can be
considered.</p>

<p>
Given a structure \((W,\lt)\), BST theory allows for the definition of
<em>space-like separation</em> as incomparability plus compatibility.
The point events \(e'_1\) and \(e'_3\) on the left of Figure
 <a href="#dispersion">7</a>
 are space-like separated, while, on the right picture, \(e'_1\) and
\(e'_3\) are with respect to each other neither causally future nor
causally past nor causally contemporaneous. Within a given history,
then, space-like separation is just incomparability, which agrees with
the corresponding definition in relativistic space-time.</p>

<p>
The relatively simple framework considered in this section is widely
developed in Belnap, M&uuml;ller, and Placek (2022) and in other works
to obtain a rigorous theory that combines relativity and indeterminism
(M&uuml;ller 2010, 2013; Placek 2010; Belnap, M&uuml;ller, &amp;
Placek 2022). We only mention here that BST theory&rsquo;s analysis of
causation and probability allows to represent probabilistic
correlation (see Belnap 2005), and that an application to quantum
correlation is given in Belnap, M&uuml;ller, and Placek (2022: 8).</p>

<p>
The representations \((W,\lt)\) for BST are susceptible to variations
(or alternative presentations) similar to those that we have
considered for BT, which would similarly involve discussions about the
adequacy of the new structures. As an example, the passage from trees
to Ockhamist frames can be adapted to BST. We can consider all the
histories in a structure \((W,\lt)\) as disjoint sets and represent
equality of point events in \((W,\lt)\) by an equivalence relation. We
obtain structures \((W^*,\lt^*, \sim)\) in which \(W^*\) is the union
\(\bigcup_{i \in I} W_i\) of disjoint sets, and \(\lt^* = \bigcup_{i
\in I} \lt_i\), where each \(\lt_i\) is a partial order relation on
\(W_i\). Since every \((W_i, \lt_i)\) is meant to represent a history,
we have also to assume that these structures are directed. Like in the
case of Ockhamist frames, the relation \(\sim\) mimics the equality in
\((W,\lt)\). Let us note that, in this context, up-forks \(e_1 \gt^*
e_2 \lt^* e_3\) can only be interpreted as instances of causal
dispersion. Branching dispersion is represented by diagrams of this
form: \(e_1 \gt^* e_2 \sim e_2' \lt^* e_3\), with \(e_2 \neq
e_2'\).</p>

<h2 id="BraTimSemForTenModLog">3. Branching time semantics for tense-modal logics</h2>

<p>
Trees, or the related set-theoretical structures considered above,
constitute the fundamental framework for BT semantics for tense-modal
 logics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 The bulk of this section
 (<a href="#RecSem">&sect;3.1</a>&ndash;<a href="#PosPro">&sect;3.2</a>)
 is devoted to BT semantics that are especially relevant to the
philosophical debate on branching time. We discuss most of these
approaches with reference to a simple Priorean propositional language
\(\mathcal{L}\) endowed with a future operator \(\mathsf{F}\)
(&ldquo;it will sometimes be the case that&rdquo;) with dual
\(\mathsf{G}\) (&ldquo;it will always be the case that&rdquo;), a past
operator \(\mathsf{P}\) (&ldquo;it was sometimes the case that&rdquo;)
with dual \(\mathsf{H}\) (&ldquo;it was always the case that&rdquo;),
and a historical possibility operator \(\lozenge\) (&ldquo;it is still
historically possible that&rdquo;) with dual \(\Box\) (&ldquo;it is
settled that&rdquo;). In presenting these semantics, we presuppose a
distinction between <em>recursive</em> semantics (or <em>semantics
proper</em>) and <em>postsemantics</em>, in MacFarlane&rsquo;s (2003,
2008, 2014) terminology. A <em>recursive semantics</em> \(S\) for
\(\mathcal{L}\) is a standard, Tarski-style recursive definition of
truth for sentences of \(\mathcal{L}\) relative to certain points of
evaluation. A postsemantics for \(\mathcal{L}\) based on \(S\) is a
direct definition of <em>truth-in-a-context</em> (in a sense akin to
that of Kaplan 1989) that is based on the notion of truth recursively
defined by \(S\). Intuitively, semantics proper provides each sentence
in \(\mathcal{L}\) with truth conditions relative to each point of
evaluation, while postsemantics tells us what sentences of
\(\mathcal{L}\) are true relative to what contexts.</p>

<p>
In the final subsection
 (<a href="#BraTimSemComSci">&sect;3.3</a>),
 we outline a few BT semantics specifically developed for applications
in computer science.</p>

<h3 id="RecSem">3.1 Recursive semantics</h3>

<p>
This section focuses on recursive semantics for BT logics. There are
basically three main strands in this area, all envisaged by Prior,
which are known as recursive <em>thin red line</em> (TRL) semantics,
<em>Peircean</em> semantics and <em>Ockhamist</em> semantics (see the
entry on
 <a href="../logic-temporal/">temporal logic</a>,
 &sect;5 for an exhaustive definition of the language and semantics
for Ockhamist and Peircean temporal logics and a discussion of
technical results). The key difference between these semantics lies in
the interpretation of the future operator \(\mathsf{F}\). Let us start
by introducing recursive TRL semantics.</p>

<p>
The past operator \(\mathsf{P}\) has the same semantic behavior in all
recursive TRL semantics:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{T}_{\alpha})\)</dt>
<dd>\(\mathsf{P} \alpha\) is true at \(m\) iff \(\alpha\) is true at
some \(m' \prec m\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
As for the future operator \(\mathsf{F}\), the general idea is that
formulae of form \(\mathsf{F} \alpha\) are true iff \(\alpha\) is true
in the actual future (see Prior 1966: 157; &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m
1981), that is, in the future on the <em>thin red
line</em>&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;the course along which history will
go&rdquo; (Belnap &amp; Green 1994: 366). This idea can be made
precise in two different ways. In presenting them, we loosely follow
the discussion in Belnap and Green (1994).</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>

<p>
In <em>absolute</em> recursive TRL semantics, models specify a history
\(\TRL\), which represents the (unique) actual history in the
tree. The future operator \(\mathsf{F}\) is understood in terms of
truth at future moments on the thin red line:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{T}_{\mathsf{F}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{F}\alpha\) is true at \(m\) iff \(\alpha\) is true at some
\(m' \in \TRL\) with \(m \prec m'\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This approach gives plausible results when future-tensed statements
are evaluated at actual moments but runs into problems when moments
not belonging to the \(\TRL\) are at stake (this may happen, for
instance, when the future-tense operator is embedded under modal
operators, see Belnap &amp; Green 1994: 379); see also Thomason 1970:
270&ndash;271).  The standard diagnosis is that a unique \(\TRL\) is
not sufficient, and one must provide each moment in the tree with its
own \(\TRL\). This requirement is satisfied in relative variants of TRL
semantics.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
In <em>relative</em> (or
 <em>Molinist</em>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 recursive TRL semantics, models define a function \(\TRL()\) that maps
each moment \(m\) to the corresponding thin red line (see McKim &amp;
Davis 1976; Thomason &amp; Gupta 1980). The simplest way to specify
the truth conditions of future-tensed statements in this framework
is:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{T}_{\mathsf{F}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{F}\alpha\) is true at \(m\) iff \(\alpha\) is true at some
\(m'\succ m\) such that \(m'\in \TRL(m)\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
As Belnap and Green (1994) point out, however, relative recursive TRL
semantics either entails that time is linear or fails to validate
natural principles such as the following:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Retrogradation.</strong> \(\alpha\to
\mathsf{H}\mathsf{F}\alpha\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, from a philosophical viewpoint, it is unclear what the
\(\TRL\) should represent in this framework: why suppose that
counterfactual moments have an actual future, and what should this
&ldquo;quasi-actual&rdquo; future represent? Even though these
contentions have been addressed in the literature (see Bra&uuml;ner,
Hasle, &amp; &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m 1998; Bra&uuml;ner 2023),
recursive TRL views have fallen out of favor nowadays, and the
attention has shifted to their postsemantic counterparts (see
 <span class="nw"><a href="#PosPro">&sect;3.2</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>
Let us turn to Peircean semantics. Peircean language is different from
our standard language \(\mathcal{L}\) in that it does not contain
modal operators and includes a weak future operator \(\mathsf{f}\),
which expresses the notion of future possibility:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{P}_{\mathsf{f}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{f}\alpha\) is (Peirce) true at \(m\) iff \(\alpha\) is true
at some \(m'\succ m\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The Peircean reading of the past operator \(\mathsf{P}\) is identical
to that of recursive TRL semantics. The future operator \(\mathsf{F}\)
receives a very strong reading:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{P}_{\mathsf{F}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{F}\alpha\) is true at \(m\) iff all histories passing
through \(m\) contain a moment \(m'\succ m\) where \(\alpha\) is
true.</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This clause is meant to capture the idea that &ldquo;nothing can be
said to be truly &lsquo;going-to-happen&rsquo; (<em>futurum</em>)
until it is so &lsquo;present in its causes&rsquo; as to be beyond
stopping&rdquo; (Prior 1962: 124). In other words, an event is truly
future only if it is inevitable. Peircean semantics is formally
pleasant and allows us to combine bivalence and excluded middle with
indeterminism. However, it has several drawbacks. For instance, it
obliterates important semantic differences, such as the one between
&ldquo;will be the case&rdquo; and &ldquo;will be inevitably the
case&rdquo;, and it fails to validate a variety of plausible
principles, including Retrogradation and the following:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Future excluded middle.</strong> \(\mathsf{F}\alpha\vee
\mathsf{F}\neg \alpha\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, let us not forget that Peirceanism predicts that all future
contingents are false, against strong semantic intuitions. As a
result, it runs up against two very general and strictly related
problems, which also affect other approaches to future contingents.
First, the so-called <em>assertion problem</em>: if future contingents
are all false (or untrue) at their moment of use, why are we entitled
to assert them? (see, e.g., Belnap &amp; Green 1994; MacFarlane 2014:
9; Besson &amp; Hattiangadi 2014; Cariani 2021b: 11). Second, the
problem of <em>future skepticism</em>: if no future contingent is
true, then we do not have any knowledge at all about future contingent
matters, for knowledge entails truth. But this skeptical conclusion is
problematic both with respect to our semantic intuitions and on
general philosophical grounds (see, e.g., Cariani 2021b, 2021a; Iacona
2022).</p>

<p>
For these and other reasons, nowadays most logicians and semanticists
regard Peircean semantics as inadequate (see, e.g., Belnap, Perloff,
&amp; Xu 2001: 160; Cariani 2021b: 4.1; MacFarlane forthcoming). It is
fair to add, however, that the key motivations behind Peirceanism are
metaphysical rather than logical or semantical. Prior favored it as
especially well suited to <em>no futurist</em> approaches in the
ontology of time (see below,
 <a href="#VarBraTimCon">&sect;4.1</a>),
 and variants of Peirceanism have been recently defended on similar
grounds (see Todd 2016a, 2021). Furthermore, there are attempts in the
recent literature to defend Peirceanism, or related semantics, against
logical and semantical objections (see, e.g., Iacona 2013; Todd 2021:
3&ndash;4; De Florio &amp; Frigerio 2024; Iacona &amp; Iaquinto 2023).
For instance, Todd (2021) has argued that principles like
Retrogradation are philosophically contentious, and their invalidity
is actually a benefit of Peirceanism (see also Andreoletti &amp;
Spolaore 2021).</p>

<p>
Ockhamist semantics is different from both the recursive TRL semantics
and Peirceanism, in that formulae are evaluated not just relative to a
given moment \(m\) but also to a history passing through \(m\). If, as
is standard, we write &ldquo;\(m/h\)&rdquo; to indicate a
moment-history pair such that \(m\in h\), the truth conditions of
formulae of form \(\mathsf{F}\alpha\) and \(\mathsf{P}\alpha\) and can
be written as:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{O}_{\mathsf{F}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{F}\alpha\) is (Ockham) true at \(m/h\) iff \(\alpha\) is
true at some \(m'/h\) with \(m \prec m'\).</p> </dd>
<dt>\((\mathrm{O}_{\mathsf{P}})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\mathsf{P} \alpha\) is true at \(m/h\) iff \(\alpha\) is true at
some \(m'/h\) with \(m' \prec m\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Then, in Ockhamist logic, the future and past operators have the same
behavior as in linear temporal logic. The historical possibility
operator \(\Diamond\) expresses an existential quantification over the
set of histories passing through the moment of evaluation:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>\((\mathrm{O}_{\Diamond})\)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\Diamond \alpha\) is true at \(m/h\) iff \(\alpha\) is true at
\(m/h'\) for some history \(h'\) passing through
 \(m\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Like Peirceanism, Ockhamism is an indeterminism-friendly semantics in
which both bivalence and the excluded middle hold. In addition, like
linear time logics, it validates many plausible principles, including
Future excluded middle and Retrogradation. Its main downside is that
it is unclear how to apply it to future-tensed utterances (see Belnap,
Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 231&ndash;233; MacFarlane 2014: 9.4). To see
where the problem lies, suppose you assert the following future
contingent:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="seabattle1">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
Tomorrow there will be a sea battle.</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
In order to apply Ockhamist semantics to your utterance, one must
select both a moment of evaluation \(m\) and a history of evaluation
\(h\). It is natural to identify \(m\) with the moment of (the context
of) use. But what about \(h\)? In general, \(m\) may belong to
different histories, and Ockhamist semantics, as such, is silent on
what the history parameter represents and how it has to be selected.
But when assessing future contingents, choosing one history over
another can make a very big difference&mdash;the same difference as
there is between truth and falsity.</p>

<p>
There are two general approaches to this problem in the
literature:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li id="app1">Stick to Ockhamist semantics and make explicit what the
history parameter stands for (Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001; Iacona
2014);</li>

<li id="app2">Use Ockham truth postsemantically, to define other,
non-history-relative notions of truth.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Approach
 <a href="#app2">(b)</a>
 is the most common today and we shall discuss it in the next
subsection.</p>

<p>
We conclude this subsection by observing that all the recursive
semantics for trees introduced here can be extended to <em>bundled
trees</em> in a natural way, by replacing the quantification over
histories with a quantification over the histories belonging to the
bundle \({\mathcal{B}}\). Thus, the second-order quantification over
the set of all histories in the tree is replaced by a first-order
quantification over <em>elements</em> of \({\mathcal{B}}\). Given the
correspondence between bundled trees and other set-theoretical
structures considered above, the TRL, Peircean and Ockhamist truth
conditions can easily be turned into truth conditions relative, e.g.,
to Kamp frames or Ockhamist frames. In this context, it is worth
observing that Ockhamist frames are genuine Kripke frames for a modal
logic with three modal operators: \(\mathsf{F}, \mathsf{P}\), and
\(\Diamond\).</p>

<h3 id="PosPro">3.2 Postsemantic proposals</h3>

<p>
As seen in the previous subsection, it is unclear how to apply
Ockhamism to ordinary statements, for their moment of use may belong
to more than one history. Postsemantic proposals tackle this problem
by defining non-history-relative notions of truth in terms of Ockham
truth.</p>

<p>
Let us start with what was historically the first proposal to go in
this direction, namely, Thomason&rsquo;s (branching time)
<em>supervaluationism</em> (1970, 1984), which is based on van
Fraassen (1966). At the core of Thomason&rsquo;s approach lies a
supervaluationist, moment-relative notion of truth (super-truth). For
our purposes, we can define super-truth relative to a moment of the
context \(m_c\), which represents the moment of use (Lewis 1970;
Kaplan 1989):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(Sup)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\alpha\) is super-true (super-false) at \(m_c\) iff \(\alpha\) is
Ockham true (false) at \(m_c/h\) for all histories \(h\) passing
through \(m_c\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Like the other postsemantic proposals we shall discuss,
supervaluationism inherits all Ockhamist validities, such as the
excluded middle, the Future excluded middle and Retrogradation.
However, unlike Ockhamism, supervaluationism is not bivalent: there
are sentences that are neither super-true nor super-false at their
moment of use, namely, future contingents. Thus, on the one hand,
supervaluationism agrees with the common philosophical view that
future contingents are neither true nor false at their moment of use,
but on the other hand, it faces both the assertion problem and the
problem of future skepticism (see
 <a href="#RecSem">&sect;3.1</a>).
 Unlike Peircean semantics, supervaluationism does not go as far as to
collapse &ldquo;will be the case&rdquo; into &ldquo;will be inevitably
the case&rdquo; but, still, it collapses (super-) truth into
inevitable truth. Partly because of such &ldquo;modal nature&rdquo; of
super-truth, supervaluationism requires us to accept important
departures from standard logical practice (see, e.g., Fine 1975;
Williamson 1994; Asher, Dever, &amp; Pappas 2009). For instance, one
can doubt that super-truth is disquotational (i.e., that
&ldquo;\(\alpha\) is super-true&rdquo; is equivalent to \(\alpha\))
and so, that it is a legitimate notion of truth at all. Moreover, if
supervaluationist consequence is defined in the most straightforward
way, based on (super-) truth-at-a-moment, we must give up pleasant
metavalidities such as the deduction theorem.</p>

<p>
<em>Relativism</em> (MacFarlane 2003, 2008, 2014; see also Belnap,
Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 175) can be thought of as a generalization of
supervaluationism. For this reason, virtually all we have said about
supervaluationism also applies to relativism. The key motivation
behind relativism is to reconcile two contrasting intuitions
concerning future contingents (MacFarlane 2003: 323&ndash;325).
Consider again
 <a href="#seabattle1">(1)</a>
 (&ldquo;Tomorrow there will be a sea battle&rdquo;) and suppose you
assert it today. On the one hand, MacFarlane says, we have the
(&lsquo;indeterminacy&rsquo;) intuition that the truth-value of your
utterance is undetermined in its context of use, which MacFarlane
calls <em>context of utterance</em>. On the other hand, if tomorrow we
find ourself in the middle of a sea battle, we will have the
(&lsquo;determinacy&rsquo;) intuition that your claim was definitely
true in the context of utterance. If we stick with the view that truth
is only sensitive to the context of utterance, MacFarlane argues, the
determinacy intuition and the indeterminacy intuition are inconsistent
with one another and at best, we can only save one of them. MacFarlane
concludes that, since we want to save both intuitions, we must give up
the view that truth is only relative to the context of utterance, and
recognize that truth is also sensitive to the context from which an
utterance is assessed (<em>context of assessment</em>). If we accept
this new form of context-sensitivity
(<em>assessment-sensitivity</em>), we can reconcile our prima facie
conflicting intuitions by saying that
 <a href="#seabattle1">(1)</a>
 is neither true nor false in its content of utterance relative to a
context of assessment located at the present moment, but it is true
relative to a context of assessment located tomorrow, in the middle of
a sea
 battle.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 For our purposes, we can identify the context of utterance and the
context of assessment, respectively, with two moments \(m_u\) and
\(m_a\) such that \(m_u\preceq m_a\). Now relativistic truth can be
defined as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(Rel)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\alpha\) is relativistically true (false) at a context of utterance
\(m_u\) and a context of assessment \(m_a\) iff \(\alpha\) is Ockham
true (false) at \(m_u/h\) for all \(h\) passing through \(m_a\).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Intuitively, a sentence is relativistically true at \(m_u,m_a\) if its
content in context \(m_u\) is historically necessary at moment
\(m_a\). Clearly, relativistic truth collapses into super-truth when
\(m_u=m_a\). Relativism can be regarded as an improvement over
supervaluationism: among other things, it is more flexible, and it can
be smoothly combined with a wider variety of philosophical views (see
below,
 <a href="#VarBraTimCon">&sect;4.1</a>).
 Relativism has also been regarded as a generalization of Ockhamism;
in this view, Ockhamism is an extreme version of relativism, where
every sentence is evaluated as if it were being assessed from the
perspective of the end of time (Wawer 2020). Relativism has been
applied, more or less successfully, to a number of semantical and
philosophical problems, and has given rise to a vast debate, which we
cannot address here (see the entry on
 <a href="../relativism/">relativism</a>,
 &sect;5 for an overview).</p>

<p>
Above, we have introduced two variants of recursive TRL views, one
relative (or Molinist) and the other absolute. Exactly the same
distinction applies to TRL postsemantic views. In <em>absolute</em>
TRL postsemantics, models specify a history TRL representing the
unique actual history in the tree (Iacona 2014; Wawer 2016; Wawer
&amp; Malpass 2020). The relevant notion of truth is defined as
follows.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt>(AbsTRL)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\alpha\) is absolutely TRL true at the moment of the context \(m_c\)
iff \(\alpha\) is Ockham truth at \(m_c/\TRL\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This semantics preserves bivalence, but is silent on how to assess
statements made at moments that lie outside the thin red line. This
feature has appeared intolerable to some philosophers; e.g., according
to Belnap, Perloff, and Xu (2001: 162), it is a &ldquo;logical&rdquo;
defect that makes the theory useless. Absolute TRL theorists have
reacted to this contention in two different ways: (i) arguing that it
is ill-conceived; (ii) providing an absolute TRL semantics that
accounts for utterances made outside of the \(\TRL\). According to (i), the
contention is based on a controversial piece of metaphysics, i.e., the
view that actual and merely possible moments all exist (see below,
 <a href="#VarBraTimCon">&sect;4.1</a>).
 Philosophers who reject this view, and subscribe to actualism (the
view that only actual things exist, see again
 <a href="#VarBraTimCon">&sect;4.1</a>),
 have a principled reason to restrict their semantic account to speech
acts performed at actual moments. After all, these are all the speech
acts that there are (Wawer 2014, 2016; Wawer &amp; Malpass 2020). An
account that goes in direction (ii) is the <em>supervaluational</em>
TRL postsemantics proposed in Malpass and Wawer 2012 and Malpass 2013.
This approach is based on the idea that, from an actualist
perspective, the utterance of a sentence \(\alpha\) made at a moment
\(m\) outside of the \(\TRL\) can be equated with a counterfactual of form
&ldquo;\(\alpha\) would be true if uttered at \(m\)&rdquo;. If we
assume that counterfactuals of this form are true (false) when
\(\alpha\) is true (false) on all histories passing through \(m\), we
get the following, disjunctive semantic definition:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt>(SupTRL)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\alpha\) is super TRL true (false) at \(m_c\) iff either \(\alpha\)
is Ockham true (false) at \(m_c/\TRL\), or \(\alpha\) is Ockham true
(false) at \(m_c/h\) for all histories passing through \(m_c\).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This definition allows one to overcome the limitations of (unamended)
absolute TRL postsemantics without giving up the idea that there
exists a unique actual history. It does so, however, at the expense of
giving up bivalence for assertions made outside of the \(\TRL\) and of
inheriting, at least in part, the non-standard logical behavior of
supervaluationism.</p>

<p>
In <em>relative</em> (or <em>Molinist</em>) TRL postsemantic views,
like in relative recursive TRL semantics (see above, 
 <a href="#RecSem">&sect;3.1</a>), 
 models define a function \(\TRL()\) that maps each moment \(m\) to the
corresponding thin red line. Truth at the moment of context \(m_c\) is
defined in the obvious way:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt>(RelTRL)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
\(\alpha\) is relatively TRL true at the moment of the context \(m_c\)
iff \(\alpha\) is Ockham truth at \(m_c/\TRL(m_c)\).</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This semantics does not share the limitations of its absolute
counterpart, preserves bivalence and is formally very well-behaved,
but is not beyond criticism. For instance, according to MacFarlane
(2014), it makes it difficult to accommodate counterfactual
assessments. Let us to suppose that today, in context \(m_{c}\), Jack
asserts:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="berk">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>

<p>
Berkeley will be sunny tomorrow.</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
MacFarlane invites us to consider two alternative moments \(m\in
\TRL(m_c)\) and \(m'\notin \TRL(m_c)\), both located tomorrow. At
\(m\), Berkeley is sunny while at the counterfactual moment \(m'\),
Berkeley is rainy. Statement
 <a href="#berk">(2)</a>
 counts as true at \(m_c\) according to relative TRL postsemantics,
for &ldquo;Berkeley is sunny&rdquo; is true on the day following
\(m_c\) on \(\TRL(m_c)\). But now let us consider an assessor that is
located at the counterfactual moment \(m'\). Based on the definition
of relative TRL truth, the assessor should regard
 <a href="#berk">(2)</a>
 as true at \(m_c\). But, MacFarlane concludes, &ldquo;that seems
wrong; the assessor has only to feel the rain on her skin to know that
Jake&rsquo;s assertion was inaccurate&rdquo; (2014: 210). In
MacFarlane&rsquo;s view, TRL theorists cannot address this problem by
making TRL truth sensitive to contexts of assessment without
collapsing their view into a form of relativism (see Wawer &amp;
Malpass 2020: 7.1, for a discussion). Convincing or not as this
objection may be, it highlights the complexity of the notion of
actuality inherent in Molinist positions.</p>

<h3 id="BraTimSemComSci">3.3 Branching time semantics in computer science</h3>

<p>
The execution of a computer program consists of a sequence of states,
and this sequence occurs in a temporal order. Thus, in the context of
computer science (CS), time itself can be conceived as a set of
successive states, which play the role of moments. These basic
observations lie at the foundation of the pioneering work Pnueli
(1977), where a temporal logic is defined with the goal of describing
and verifying properties of programs.</p>

<p>
Many variants and extensions of Pnueli (1977)&rsquo;s logic were
subsequently defined. A common aspect of these logics is that they are
propositional logics and that the semantical structures for them are
based on pairs \((S,R)\), where \(S\) is a set (of states) and \(R\)
is a binary relation on \(S\). The intended reading of \(s R s'\) is
that \(s'\) is a successor state of \(s\), or that the program under
consideration transforms state \(s\) into \(s'\). A further element of
this semantics is a labeling function \(L\), which assigns to each
state the set of propositional variables that are assumed to be true
at that state.</p>

<p>
In this framework, a (possibly endless) execution of a program is
represented by an \(R\)-sequence, that is, a sequence \(s_0, s_1,
\dots\) in which, for every \(i\), \(s_i R s_{i+1}\) holds. This means
that \(R\)-sequences play the role that histories have in synchronized
BT frames. The controversy &ldquo;tree vs bundled tree&rdquo; can also
be transferred to structures \((S,R,L)\): one may consider the set of
<em>all</em> \(R\)-sequences or just a set \(\Sigma\) of sequences
with suitable closure properties (see, e.g., Stirling 1992). Thus, the
most general structures have the form \((S,R, L , \Sigma)\).</p>

<p>
There is a natural ordering between the elements of \(\Sigma\), which,
according to the observations above, can be thought as a temporal
ordering. Given the sequences \(\sigma = s_0, s_1, \dots\) and
\(\sigma' = s'_0, s'_1, \dots\), we write \(\sigma \lhd \sigma'\) if
there exists \(i \gt 0\) such that, for all \(n\), \(s'_n = s_{n+i}\).
That is, \(\sigma'\) can be obtained from \(\sigma\) by deleting the
first \(i\) states. The relation \(\lhd\) is trivially transitive.
Other possible properties of \(\lhd\) depend on the relation \(R\) and
on the sequences in \(\Sigma\).</p>

<p>
Also the languages for temporal logics of programs have many variants
in the literature. The most common language is apparently a
propositional language with the binary operator \(\mathsf{U}\)
(<em>Until</em>). Write \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathsf{U}}\) for this
language. In ordinary (Priorean) temporal logic, the formula
\(\alpha\, \mathsf{U} \, \beta\) is true at the moment \(m\) whenever,
for some moment \(m' \succ m\), \(\beta\) is true at \(m'\), and
\(\alpha\) is true at every \(m''\) such that \(m \prec m'' \prec
 m'\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Given a structure \((S, R, L, \Sigma)\), the formulas of
\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathsf{U}}\) are recursively evaluated at elements of
\(\Sigma\). A propositional variable is true or false at \(\sigma =
s_0, \dots\) according to whether it belongs to \(L(s_0)\) or not.
Boolean connectives are interpreted in the usual way. The truth value
of \(\alpha\, \mathsf{U} \beta\) at \(\sigma\) is determined on the
basis of the semantics for \(\mathsf{U}\) considered in the previous
paragraph, with the relation \(\prec\) replaced by \(\lhd\). Thus, in
order to make sense of this, an obvious closure property for
\(\Sigma\) is that: if \(\sigma, \sigma' \in \Sigma\) and \(\sigma
\lhd \sigma'' \lhd \sigma'\), then \(\sigma'' \in \Sigma\). The logic
based on this or similar semantics is known as <em>Linear Temporal
Logic</em> (LTL). In fact, the truth value of a formula at a given
\(\sigma\) depends only on the truth values of other formulas at
subsequences of \(\sigma\), which are linearly ordered by \(\lhd\).
LTL has proven useful for describing and verifying properties of
programs (Emerson 1990).</p>

<p>
In order to deal with different computations simultaneously, other
temporal logics have been defined, which are also based on structures
\((S, R, L, \Sigma)\). Among these, the most popular ones are the
<em>Computational Tree Logics</em> CTL and CTL\(^*\) (Emerson &amp;
Clarke 1982), which can be viewed as the computer science counterparts
of Peircean and Ockhamist logics. In particular, the language for
CTL\(^*\) includes a unary operator, denoted by \(E\) or \(\exists\),
corresponding to the Ockhamist \(\Diamond\) discussed above. Both LTL
and CTL turn out to be fragments of CTL\(^*\). There is, instead, no
inclusion relation between LTL and CTL. There are properties of
programs that can be expressed in LTL but not in CTL, and, conversely,
there are CTL-expressible properties that cannot be expressed in
LTL.</p>

<h2 id="PhiVieBraTim">4. Philosophical views on branching time</h2>

<p>
This section deals with philosophical debates concerning branching
time and the BT conception. In
 <a href="#VarBraTimCon">&sect;4.1</a>,
 we classify versions of the BT conception depending on their
assumptions about time, modality, and the future; moreover, we briefly
discuss the connections between these positions and the semantic views
outlined in
 <a href="#BraTimSemForTenModLog">&sect;3</a>.
 In
 <a href="#GenChaBraTimCon">&sect;4.2</a>,
 we introduce some general challenges to the BT conception.</p>

<h3 id="VarBraTimCon">4.1 Varieties of the branching time conception</h3>

<p>
The philosophical debate on branching time is strictly connected to
traditional debates on the nature of time and modality (see the
entries on
 <a href="../time/">time</a>
 and
 <a href="../possible-worlds/">possible worlds</a>
 for further information). The debate about time is traditionally
framed in terms of <em>times</em> and not of <em>moments</em>.
However, when a specific history is at stake, times can be identified
with moments. In this way, different views in the philosophy of time
can be made to correspond to different interpretations of BT
frames.</p>

<p>
There are two main positions in the debate, known as (standard)
<em>A-theory</em> (or <em>tense realism</em>), and <em>B-theory</em>.
For our purposes, we may represent their disagreement as concerning
the following principles:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Temporal orientation.</strong> the present time is either
metaphysically privileged over all the other times (past or future
times) or it is the only time that exists.</li>

<li><strong>Temporal neutrality.</strong> all times, present, past and
future, are metaphysically on a par (i.e., they are entities of the
same kind and none of them plays an objectively prominent role).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A-theorists subscribe to temporal
 orientation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 As a consequence, they hold that tensed notions such as
<em>present</em>, <em>past</em> and <em>future</em> can be used to
denote objective, non-perspectival (and non-indexical) features of
reality. When we say that an event is present in this sense, we are
attributing to it an objective feature, just as when we say that it is
temporally extended. The present time is not just the temporal
coordinate where we are located but it is also the correct vantage
point on the whole of reality: what is the case from our present
perspective is what is <em>absolutely</em> the case.</p>

<p>
In some philosophical quarters, the A-theory is also indicated as
&ldquo;presentism&rdquo;. In contemporary philosophy of time, however,
<em>presentism</em> is an ontological position: the view that only
what is present exists (see the entry on
 <a href="../presentism/">presentism</a>).
 The main ontological alternatives to presentism are
<em>eternalism</em>, the view that past, present and future things all
exist (see Williamson 2013; Cameron 2015; Deasy 2015), and the
<em>growing-block</em> theory, the view that only past and present
things exist (see Broad 1923; Tooley 1997; Briggs &amp; Forbes 2012;
Correia &amp; Rosenkranz 2018). Presentism and the growing block
theory are different forms of <em>no-futurism</em>, the view that
future things do not exist.</p>

<p>
B-theorists are temporally neutral. As a consequence, they regard
tensed notions as purely perspectival: there is nothing like being
absolutely present, or future, for the same reason that there is
nothing like being absolutely here, or three miles ahead. When we say
that an event is present, we are just saying that it is (roughly)
simultaneous with our utterance. There is no privileged vantage point
within the timeline, and reality is best represented from a tenseless
viewpoint, blind to the distinction between (absolute) present, past
and future. Temporal neutrality is only consistent with an eternalist
ontology.</p>

<p>
The debate about modality can be characterized in a similar way. It
includes two main positions, which are traditionally characterized in
terms of (possible) <em>worlds</em> (and not histories):</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Modal orientation.</strong> the actual world is either
metaphysically privileged over all the others or it is the only one
that exists.</li>

<li><strong>Modal neutrality.</strong> all worlds are metaphysically
on a par.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The distinction between modal orientation and modal neutrality, unlike
its temporal counterpart, cannot be immediately applied to the debate
about BT, for it is not obvious how worlds relate to histories. More
precisely, while B-theorists can safely equate worlds with histories,
many A-theorists would resist the identification. For instance,
presentists think of the actual world as consisting of (what we have
called) a moment and not a whole history. Thus, it is best to
integrate the distinction between modal orientation and modal
neutrality with a further distinction, which is specific to the debate
on BT:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Forward orientation.</strong> the actual future is either
metaphysically privileged over all the others or it is the only one
that exists.</li>

<li><strong>Forward orientation.</strong> all futures are
metaphysically on a par.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most philosophers subscribe to modal orientation. As a consequence,
they think that modal words like &ldquo;actual&rdquo; are not just
indexical expressions and can also be used to indicate objective,
non-perspectival features of reality. Modally oriented philosophers
who subscribe to temporal neutrality (B-theory) are also committed to
forward orientation, for the (tenseless) existence of a unique,
complete actual history entails the existence of a unique actual
future. Conversely, in the debate on BT, modally oriented philosophers
who subscribe to temporal orientation (A-theory) generally subscribe
to forward neutrality (although their view is also consistent with
forward orientation, see
 <a href="#ActFut">&sect;4.1.2</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
A few philosophers&mdash;most famously, David Lewis&mdash;are modally
neutral and regard modal notions such as <em>actual</em> and
<em>possible</em> as purely perspectival in nature. Among BT
theorists, the most prominent modally neutral philosopher is Nuel
Belnap.</p>

<p>
From an ontological viewpoint, modal orientation is consistent with
two views: <em>actualism</em> (only actual things/worlds exist) and
<em>possibilism</em> (all possible things exist). Modal neutrality is
only consistent with a possibilist ontology. Similar ontological
considerations apply to forward orientation and forward
neutrality.</p>

<p>
To summarize, there are two opposite stances concerning time,
modality, and possible futures in the debate on branching time:
oriented and neutral approaches. In general, oriented approaches can
be further classified on the basis of their ontology. To illustrate
these distinctions, consider the contrast between the two tree
diagrams in
 <a href="#figtree_comp">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>
The diagram on the left represents a view consistent with temporal,
modal and forward neutrality: all moments in the tree are
metaphysically on a par, and what we can call present, or actual,
entirely depends on our &ldquo;local&rdquo; experiential perspective.
The diagram on the right represents a view consistent with modal
orientation, temporal orientation, and forward neutrality, in which
past actuality and presentness are absolute (not only perspectival),
and all future branches exist and are on a par, but past branches go
out of existence as time goes by. We shall discuss both views in a few
lines.</p>

<h4 id="BraTimReaBraSpaTimRea">4.1.1 Branching time realism and Branching Space-Times realism</h4>

<p>
We shall speak of <em>branching time realism</em> (BT realism) to
indicate modally neutral variants of the BT conception. BT realism is
consistent with the idea that all futures departing from the present
moment obtain (i.e., are absolutely actual) and each single thing,
including ourselves, is constantly splitting into countless duplicates
of itself. Conceptions of this sort are popularly associated with the
Everettian or <em>many-worlds</em> interpretation of quantum mechanics
(on Everettian quantum mechanics, see the entries on
 <a href="../qm-everett/">Everettian quantum mechanics</a>
 and
 <a href="../qm-manyworlds/">the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>).
 We collectively refer to them as <em>strong</em> BT realisms. Strong
BT realisms have never been rigorously developed or seriously defended
by analytic philosophers. In the literature on BT, strong BT realism
is generally discussed in connection with the B-theory, under
different labels: <em>B-theoretic branching</em> (Barnes &amp; Cameron
2011: 10); <em>&lsquo;block multiverse&rsquo;</em> (Pooley 2013: 339);
<em>realism about many futures</em> (Meyer 2016: 206); <em>na&iuml;ve
BT realism</em> (Wawer 2016: 8); <em>many worlds view</em> (Spolaore
&amp; Gallina 2020: 108); <em>actual branching</em> (Ninan 2023: 478).
However, strong BT realism can also be joined with temporal
orientation (A-theory), resulting in a tensed variant of strong BT
realism (this is, arguably, the position outlined in Abruzzese 2001).
In strong tensed BT realism, each history is actual and is endowed
with a privileged, &ldquo;locally present&rdquo; moment. If we think
of all these &ldquo;locally present&rdquo; moments as lying on the
same instant (see above,
 <a href="#TreBunTre">&sect;2.1</a>),
 we can illustrate this view as in
 <a href="#figtensed_branching_realism">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>
The only version of BT realism that has been clearly defined and
defended so far in the literature is due to Belnap and his co-authors.
We may call it <em>modal</em> BT realism
 (<a href="#figtree_comp">Fig. 8</a>,
 left diagram). One of its key assumptions is the Aristotelian notion
that &ldquo;talk of possibilities only makes sense before a contrast
between possibility and actuality&rdquo; (Belnap, M&uuml;ller, &amp;
Placek 2022: 3). By modal neutrality, this means that we can only
speak of possibility and actuality in a <em>perspectival</em> sense,
that is, from a perspective internal to the tree. More precisely, talk
of (historical) possibility only makes sense when a <em>moment</em> is
fixed, and talk of actuality, when both a moment <em>and</em> a
history are fixed. What is possible is <em>temporally</em> local (it
is relative to a moment) and what is actual is also
<em>historically</em> local (it is relative to a moment/history pair).
If we identify actuality with the realm of what <em>obtains</em> (as
opposed to what <em>can possibly</em> obtain), we can also say that
there is no absolute obtainment: facts and events obtain only relative
to moment-history pairs. From a global or &ldquo;external&rdquo;
perspective, it makes no sense to distinguish actuality and
possibility, that is, the things that <em>do</em> obtain from those
that <em>can</em> obtain. Again from a global perspective, we can also
say that all moments in the tree are equally concrete, for all play
similar causal roles and there is no intrinsic difference between
those that are (perspectivally) actual and those that are merely
possible.</p>

<p>
As seen before
 (<a href="#RepBraSpaTim">&sect;2.3</a>),
 in a series of works spanning from Belnap (1992) to Belnap,
M&uuml;ller, and Placek (2022), Belnap and his coauthors have
developed Branching Space-Times (BST) frames. Just like BT frames, BST
frames allow for different interpretations, including a realist
conception akin to BT realism (&ldquo;BST realism&rdquo;). The only
variant of BST realism discussed in the literature is due to Belnap
and his coauthors, and we shall call it <em>modal</em> BST realism. In
this view, all that BT realists say about moments also holds for point
events (and other spatially limited events). From a global
perspective, again, it makes no sense to distinguish what point events
are actual and what are merely possible, and all point events can be
regarded as equally concrete.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In what follows I will try to avoid indexical language. In particular,
I will not draw a distinction (inevitably indexical when not
relational) between the actual and the possible except in motivating
or giving examples. &lsquo;Possible point events&rsquo; are thus just
&lsquo;point events&rsquo;. These point events are to be taken not as
mere spatiotemporal positions open for alternate concrete fillings,
but as themselves concrete particulars. (Belnap 1992: 388)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are several objections to (some versions of) BT realism in the
literature. Some of these objections point to conflicts between BT
realism and common sense presuppositions. Here is David Lewis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The trouble with branching [&hellip;] is that it conflicts with our
ordinary presupposition that we have a single future. If two futures
are equally mine, one with a sea fight tomorrow and one without, it is
nonsense to wonder which way it will be&mdash;it will be both
ways&mdash;and yet I do wonder. (Lewis 1986: 207&ndash;208)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; objection has different bite against strong BT realism
and against Belnap&rsquo;s modal BT realism. Strong BT realists have
no reason to worry about the objection: they can simply agree that the
future will be both ways, although only one of them will be part of
our experience. On the other hand, Belnap and other modal BT realists
replied to Lewis&rsquo;s objection that it rests on a misguided
understanding of their position. They grant that, if tomorrow&rsquo;s
sea fight is contingent, the present situation will evolve in one way
<em>in some history</em> and in the other <em>in some different
history</em>, but deny that we can simply drop the relativization to
histories and conclude that &ldquo;it will be both ways&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Lewis misdescribes the theory of branching time in saying of such a
situation that &ldquo;it will be both ways.&rdquo; Branching time is
entirely clear that &ldquo;Tomorrow there will be a sea fight and
tomorrow there will not be a sea fight&rdquo; is a contradiction.
[&hellip;] <em>Given indeterminism, it does not suffice to think of
truth (or denotation, etc.) as relative only to moments.</em>
[&hellip;] One must relativize truth to the history parameter as well.
(Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001:
 <span class="nw">225)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
This reply is technically correct: modal BT realism does not entail
that there will both be and will not be a sea fight tomorrow. However,
Lewis has a point when he contends that BT realism clashes with
ordinary presuppositions. Consider again the issue whether tomorrow
there will be a sea fight. We commonly presuppose that as of tomorrow,
this issue will be settled in a <em>single</em> and <em>absolute</em>
way, not just in different ways relative to different futures.
However, this is a presupposition BT realists are bound to reject (but
see Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 205&ndash;206). For discussions of
other putative counter-intuitive consequences of BT realism, see
Belnap, Perloff, and Xu (2001: 7B.2A), and Cameron (2015: 5.2).</p>

<p>
According to another family of objections, BT realism entails that our
universe is (in some metaphysical sense) entirely determinate, or
deterministic. For instance, Barnes and Cameron (2009) argue that, in
B-theoretical BT realism, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly settled how
things will be, you just don&rsquo;t know whereabouts you&rsquo;ll be
within reality&rdquo;. In the same vein, Benovsky (2013) contends
that, in BT realism, &ldquo;the futures are all there, they are all
fixed because they &lsquo;already&rsquo; exist&rdquo;. Something
similar to what just said about Lewis&rsquo;s objection also holds
here. These objections have no bite against strong BT realists
inspired by the Everettian interpretation, which is fundamentally
deterministic (see below,
 <a href="#GenChaBraTimCon">&sect;4.2</a>).
 As for <em>modal</em> BT realists, they would reply that there is no
sense of &ldquo;settled&rdquo; or &ldquo;already&rdquo; in which, in
their view, the future is <em>settled</em> or all futures
<em>already</em> exist.</p>

<p>
For other objections against BT and BST realism see Earman (2008) and
the replies in Placek and Belnap (2012).</p>

<h4 id="ActFut">4.1.2 Actual futurism</h4>

<p>
Let us speak of <em>actual futurism</em> to indicate modally and
forwardly oriented variants of the BT conception.</p>

<p>
Actual futurism is the most common B-theoretical position (see
 <a href="#figactual_futurism">Fig. 10</a>).
 B-theoretical actual futurism is usually combined with actualism:
only the course of events corresponding to the actual history exists
(Wawer 2014; Wawer &amp; Malpass 2020). Actual futurists who subscribe
to actualism regard BT frames as useful tools for representing the
modal properties of actual individuals and events, but do not regard
them as literal representations of reality. In their view, thinking of
the actual history and merely possible histories as entities of the
same kind is a little like taking Sherlock Holmes for a real person.
Alternatively, one can subscribe to a possibilist version of actual
futurism, modeled on Bricker (2006)&rsquo;s position in the
metaphysics of modality: all courses of events represented in the tree
exist, but some of them, those corresponding to the actual history,
are metaphysically privileged (Borghini &amp; Torrengo 2013). Let us
emphasize that all these actual futurists regard the actual history as
unique or privileged only from a tenseless, &ldquo;end of time&rdquo;
perspective, and they agree that, <em>as of the present time</em>,
many futures are possible and are all on a par. B-theoretical actual
futurism is by far the most debated variant of actual futurism. Its
critics from both the A-theoretical and the BT realist camp often
content that it does not capture a deeper, metaphysical sense in which
the future is indeterminate or &ldquo;open&rdquo; (see, e.g., Barnes
&amp; Williams 2011; Barnes &amp; Cameron 2011; Cameron 2015; and
Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Xu 2001: 6).</p>

 <a href="figdesc.html#figactual_futurism">extended description of figure 10</a>

</div>

<p>
Forward orientation can also be joined with temporal orientation,
resulting in a <em>tensed</em> version of actual futurism. According
to tensed actual futurism, one history (the actual one) is
<em>presently</em> privileged over all the others, or it is the only
one that exists. This view is internally consistent, but is in tension
with indeterminism, and it has never been extensively defended in the
literature (see De Florio &amp; Frigerio 2022 for a discussion).
Tensed actual futurism also admits of a &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; variant,
known as <em>mutable futurism</em>, in which the privileged future can
<em>change</em> across time. Mutable futurism is clearly consistent
with indeterminism, but it requires us to make sense of the puzzling
idea of a changing future (for discussions, see Todd 2016b and
Andreoletti &amp; Spolaore 2021).</p>

<h4 id="AsyVie">4.1.3 Asymmetry views</h4>

<p>
Let us speak of <em>asymmetry views</em> to indicate the variants of
the BT conception that combine forward neutrality with modal
orientation. In asymmetry views, there exists a unique, absolutely
actual past, but no actual future. All asymmetry views are
A-theoretical in character, and can be distinguished on the basis of
their ontology.</p>

<p>
In <em>no-futurist</em> asymmetry views, possible futures are
conceived as abstract or general entities (e.g., Briggs &amp; Forbes
2012; Todd 2021; Rosenkranz 2012; Rumberg 2016b). This was arguably
Prior&rsquo;s (1967a) own position (see, e.g., Hasle &amp;
&Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m 2016: 3411). Like actual futurists,
no-futurists tend not to regard BT frames as literal representations
of reality. A growing-block variant of this view is represented in
 <a href="#figgrowing_block">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>
In <em>eternalist</em> asymmetry views, futures are concrete courses
of events. The most debated eternalist asymmetry view is the so-called
<em>pruning</em> conception of branching time (McCall 1994, see
 <a href="#figpruning">Fig. 12</a>).
 In the pruning conception, the only moments representing existing
events are the unique present moment and those that are
\(\prec\)-connected with it. Intuitively, the idea is that the whole
tree changes over time: as presentness &ldquo;moves&rdquo; towards the
future, all the moments that do not lie on its path go out of
existence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Of all the possible futures [&hellip;] one and only one becomes
&ldquo;actual&rdquo;, i.e. becomes part of the past. The other
branches vanish. The universe model is a tree that &ldquo;grows&rdquo;
or ages by losing branches. (McCall 1994: 3)</p>

<p>
In <em>possibilist</em> asymmetry views, all possible moments exist,
all past moments are actual, but only the unique present moment and
its past are absolutely actual. Intuitively, the idea is that of a
&lsquo;moving dot&rsquo; of presentness that travels along the tree
towards the future, leaving a trace of actuality (for discussions, see
Barnes &amp; Cameron 2011; MacFarlane 2014: 212); Wawer 2016:
170&ndash;172).</p>

<p>
The main objections to asymmetry views essentially coincide with the
main objections to the A-theory of time: both would introduce
postulates, such as the existence of an absolute present and of very
strong temporal asymmetries, which lack scientific justification in
light of present-day physics. On their side, the advocates of
asymmetry have a variety of traditional A-theoretical replies to these
objections at their disposal, spanning from strong rebuttals (e.g.,
insist that the first-person evidence for their view that comes from
our conscious experience outweighs any scientific and methodological
consideration one may label against it) to more modest defenses (e.g.,
suggest that for all we know, future developments in physics could
ultimately favor the A-theory). For overviews of the debate on the
physical respectability of the A-theory, see the entries on

<h4 id="SemMet">4.1.4 Semantics and metaphysics</h4>

<p>
Let us conclude this subsection by outlining some natural connections
between the versions of the BT conception discussed so far (see Table
 <a href="#tab1">1</a>)
 and the branching time semantics introduced in the previous section.
Recognizing these connections helps to better understand and assess
metaphysical or semantical choices, but natural connections should not
be confused with logical entailments: the choice of a semantics does
not need to determine the choice of a metaphysic, and vice versa (see
Wawer 2016: 6.5, for a discussion of this point). Looking back at the
semantics introduced in
 <a href="#BraTimSemForTenModLog">&sect;3</a>,
 we can distinguish between two general strands. On the one hand, we
have semantics in which bivalence is preserved and there are true
future contingents. In these semantics, we can say that one future is
<em>alethically</em> privileged over all the others, i.e., the future
where all true future contingents are true. The advocates of these
semantics are generally called <em>true futurists</em>. Standard TRL
views are true futurist semantics in this sense. Philosophers who
oppose true futurism, and think that all possible futures are
alethically on a par, are called <em>open futurists</em>. Paradigmatic
open futurist semantics include supervaluationism, relativism and
Peirceanism.</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>True futurism.</strong> One future is alethically
privileged over all the others.</li>

<li><strong>Open futurism.</strong> All futures are alethically on a
par.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Forward neutrality, the view that no future is metaphysically
privileged over all the others, tends to correlate with open futurism.
If there is no unique actual future, one is naturally led to think,
then there is nothing against which future contingents can be assessed
as true. As just seen, forward neutrality is consistent with two kinds
of positions: BT realism and asymmetry views. Let us start with the
latter.</p>

<p>
Most advocates of asymmetry views subscribe to both future neutrality
and open futurism (e.g., Prior 1967a; Rhoda 2011; Todd 2016a, 2021).
However, a few A-theorists disagree on this point and combine future
neutrality with true futurism (Westphal 2006; Rosenkranz 2012; see
also Baia 2012; Wawer 2016; and Correia &amp; Rosenkranz 2018).
&ldquo;Deviant&rdquo; combinations like these, in which semantics and
metaphysics seem to pull in different directions, are generally based
on non-standard views concerning truth. More specifically, both
Westphal and Rosenkranz give up the traditional principle that truth
is grounded in (or supervenes on) reality.</p>

<p>
BT realists tend to be open futurists, but unlike the advocates of
asymmetry views, they reject the very notion of absolute actuality as
meaningless, or empty. For this reason, they tend to favor different
semantic approaches. From a BT realist perspective, as Belnap,
Perloff, and Xu (2001: 6B.7) have stressed, future contingents are
semantically similar to (contingent) open formulae: just like one
cannot evaluate &ldquo;\(x\) is red&rdquo; without specifying an
assignment of value to \(x\), so one cannot sensibly assess
 <a href="#seabattle1">(1)</a>
 relative to a moment alone. Thus, future contingents can only be
sensibly assessed relative to points of evaluation where their
truth-value is settled. For this reason, Belnap, Perloff, and Xu
(2001) adopt Ockhamist semantics and insist that future contingents
can only be evaluated when both a moment <em>and</em> a history
parameter are provided. However, this is not the only choice available
for BT realists&mdash;for instance, they can also subscribe to some
form of relativist semantics (MacFarlane 2003, 2008).</p>

<p>
Generally, actual futurists adopt some form of true futurist semantics
(e.g., Malpass &amp; Wawer 2012; Wawer 2014; see also Andreoletti
&amp; Spolaore 2021). This is a natural choice: if one holds that the
actual future exists, one is led to think that future-tensed
statements are to be assessed against it, and vice versa. But it is
not a forced one, and some actual futurist favors Ockhamist semantics
instead (Iacona 2014).</p>

<h3 id="GenChaBraTimCon">4.2 General challenges to the branching time conception</h3>

<p>
So far, we have discussed the main variants of the BT conception and
some objections that may be labeled against each of them. In this
subsection, we briefly introduce a few, very general objections, which
apply to most or all variants of the BT conception. These are general
challenges to the very idea that trees, however understood, are better
suited to represent our indeterministic universe than alternative,
non-tree-like structures. Here, we focus on challenges concerning two
key tenets of the BT conception: <em>forward</em> <em>branching</em>
and <em>No backward branching</em>.</p>

<p>
<em>Forward branching</em> is the view that our indeterministic
universe and its tense-modal features are best represented in terms of
a plurality of possible futures following a certain specific
moment/event. This conception of indeterminism has been called
<em>Aristotelian</em> in Placek and Belnap (2012) (see also
M&uuml;ller 2012). In the Aristotelian conception, indeterminism is a
<em>modal</em> notion, having to do with future-directed
possibilities. The Aristotelian conception can be contrasted with
other approaches, in which indeterminism is characterized in terms of
similarity and divergence between different models (see, e.g.,
Montague 1974; Earman 1986) or different worlds (see above,
 <a href="#NonBraRep">&sect;2.2</a>;
 see also Lewis 1986), or by resorting to a primitive notion of
indeterminacy (see, e.g., Barnes &amp; Cameron 2009). Let us note that
forward branching presupposes that, in some sense, different
possibilities can share certain objects or events. This view is part
of the standard Kripkean (1963, 1980) approach to modality, in which
the domains of different worlds may include one and the same entity.
In fact, BT frames have also been used by philosophers such as Prior
(1960) and J. L. Mackie (1974) to vindicate the standard approach, by
offering reasonably clear sufficient conditions for an entity to
participate in alternative courses of events (see P. Mackie 2006 for a
discussion of these attempts; see also Placek &amp; Belnap 2012 and
the entry on
 <a href="../identity-transworld/">transworld identity</a>).
 The idea that different worlds may share parts (in a literal, realist
sense) has been famously criticized by Lewis (1986: 4.2), who
maintained that distinct possible worlds have no object or event in
common, that is, are all pairwise mereologically disjoint (see
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>).
 This Lewisian conception of possible worlds is called
<em>divergence</em>.</p>

<p>
A metaphysical objection to forward branching is due to Barnes &amp;
Cameron (2011), who contend that, by resorting to trees, we cannot
model contingent &ldquo;doomsday&rdquo; situations, where it is
indeterminate <em>whether anything will happen at all</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The problem is that the absence of further branches from a node
doesn&rsquo;t represent the further open possibility that nothing will
happen beyond that node, it simply represents the absence of further
open possibilities. (2011: 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let us call this the <em>doomsday</em> objection to branching time.
From a technical viewpoint, the objection is based on the fact that
histories, as standardly defined, are maximal sequences of moments
(see above,
 <a href="#TreBunTre">&sect;2.1</a>),
 and thus no history can properly include another history. Standard as
this definition may be, however, it is unclear whether is forced upon
BT theorists. Arguably, the doomsday objection has weight only against
BT theorists who subscribe to a <em>moment-based</em> conception of
histories, in which histories are completely determined by their
constituent moments (see Andreoletti 2022), as opposed to views in
which histories are not defined in terms of moments, such as, for
instance, in van Benthem&rsquo;s (1999) geometrical approach to BT
(see above,
 <a href="#TreBunTre">&sect;2.1</a>).
 Moreover, the objection assumes that philosophers have a univocal,
shared notion of what a contingent doomsday would consist in, which is
contentious (see Todd forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Many BT theorists look to quantum mechanics as a core motivation for
subscribing to indeterminism and, consequently, to forward branching
(see, e.g., Placek &amp; Belnap 2012; Belnap, M&uuml;ller, &amp;
Plackek 2022). The underlying reasoning is that quantum indeterminacy
entails indeterminism, and indeterminism is best modeled by resorting
to forward branching. This train of thought may be called the
<em>quantum argument</em> for forward branching. Initially plausible
as it may be, the quantum argument has at least three problems.
Although neither of these problems is untreatable (and arguably,
mature BT conceptions such as modal BT/BST realism have the resources
to address them), they should be taken into account.</p>

<p>
The first problem is that not every interpretation of quantum
mechanics is indeterministic. More specifically, the many-worlds
interpretation, in which the forward branching process is taken at
face value, is deterministic at the fundamental level, and all the
indeterminacy (if any) posited by the theory is restricted to
derivative aspects of the ontology (see, e.g., Wilson 2020). Moreover,
according to some philosophers, the ontology of the many-worlds
interpretation is also consistent with a divergence (rather than
branching) conception of worlds (Saunders 2010; Wilson 2012). Thus, in
general, philosophers who subscribe to the quantum argument should be
clear as to what interpretation of quantum mechanics they are
presupposing and how it accounts for the branching process.</p>

<p>
Secondly, one can doubt that quantum indeterminacy can be interpreted
as unsettledness between pairs of determinate (classical) states of
affairs, and some authors (e.g., Skow 2010; Darby 2010) have
independently argued that it cannot (but see Mariani, Michels, &amp;
Torrengo 2024 for a different view).</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the relation between quantum indeterminacy and dynamical
indeterminism is not obvious, and most scholars tend to agree that, at
least in principle, they are independent notions (see Calosi &amp;
Mariani 2021 for a recent review of the debate on quantum
indeterminacy). Thus, the advocates of the quantum argument should be
very clear as to the connections they posit between quantum
indeterminacy and indeterminism.</p>

<p>
Let us turn to the second potentially problematic aspect of the BT
conception, i.e., No backward branching, according to which each
moment has a unique (possible) past. As mentioned above, the main
motivations for the principle are philosophical: keeping as clear and
neat as possible the distinctions between (i) particular events and
repeatable (qualitative or informational) states, and (ii) historical
(objective) modality and epistemic modality.</p>

<p>
Against No backward branching, one can argue that the time asymmetry
it introduces lacks physical justification, for at least two reasons
(see Earman 2008; Farr 2012). Firstly, because under certain natural
assumptions, all known fundamental laws of physics are time-reversal
invariant. Thus, in a very standard sense of indeterminism, our
universe is indeterministic in both temporal directions: assuming all
present events are kept fixed, it is indeterminate what events will
happen in the future <em>and also</em> what events had happened in the
past. Secondly, because the time asymmetries that we observe in our
experience and in science are commonly explained in terms of an
asymmetry in the boundary conditions of the universe and not of a
fundamental asymmetry in the laws of nature (see Albert 2000; Loewer
2012; Kutach 2013; Farr 2022). If so, in the words of Farr (2012:
114):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is insufficient reason to think that [the observable
asymmetries] constitute, or provide evidence of the existence of, a
time-asymmetric modal structure of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
BT theorists can reply to both these objections. On the one hand, they
can insist that time reversibility is relevant only when the focus is
on qualitative or epistemic states as opposed to particular, non
repeatable events. In their view, the very idea of two alternative
particular events temporally or causally followed by a unique
particular event is absurd.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
No sense can be made of two alternative possible evolutions, separate
before some event and combining into a single evolution after it.
(Placek &amp; Belnap 2012: 465)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, BT theorists can subscribe to a primitivist
conception of the direction of time, according to which observable
time asymmetries depend on a fundamental asymmetry in the laws of
nature (see Maudlin 2002, 2007).</p>
