<h1>Leibniz&rsquo;s Ethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Aug 26, 2004; substantive revision Tue Jun 17, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Although Leibniz never wrote a systematic ethical treatise, in his
view theology is a type of jurisprudence, a science of law (NE, p.
526). And Leibniz contributed a systematic work to the field of
theology, namely, the <em>Theodicy</em> (1710), the only large-scale
philosophical work that he published during his lifetime. Given that
Leibniz the natural theologian and metaphysician is, at the same time,
a moral philosopher, ethics has a central place in his philosophical
system. No divisions exist among the nominally different fields. Thus
the view that he never wrote a systematic ethical treatise is not true
without qualification. Moreover, the fact that he views theology as a
science of law provides some insight into the character of his ethics.
He offers a natural law theory, and, like other such theories, its
basic structure consists of a theory of the good and a theory of law.
Compliance with the principles spelled out in the latter is necessary
and sufficient to achieve the good. Since, according to Leibniz, God
is the measure of the good, the primary directive of his ethics is
that one ought to imitate divinity as far as possible.</p>

<h2 id="TheGoo">1. Theory of the Good</h2>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics centers on a composite theory of the good.
Three longstanding philosophical doctrines compose the theory: (1) the
Platonic view that goodness is coextensive with reality or being, (2)
the perfectionist view that the highest good consists in the
development and perfection of one&rsquo;s nature, and (3) the hedonist
view that the highest good is pleasure. This set of doctrines is
disclosed in Leibniz&rsquo;s tripartite division of the good into the
metaphysical good, the moral good, and the physical good (T &sect;209,
p. 258). He equates the metaphysical good with reality, moral goodness
with virtue, and the physical good with pleasure. Moreover, with each
type of good exists a correlative type of evil. The metaphysical good
of reality correlates with the metaphysical evil of privation of
reality or non-being. Similarly, the moral goodness of virtue relates
to the moral evil of sin or vice. Finally, the physical good of
pleasure is contrary to the physical evil of pain (T &sect;21, p.
136). The theory constructed out of these divergent doctrines
illustrates Leibniz&rsquo;s eclectic approach to philosophical
investigation. As he puts it in a comment on his own system of
philosophy, &ldquo;This system appears to unite Plato with Democritus,
Aristotle with Descartes, the Scholastics with the moderns, theology
and morality with reason. Apparently it takes the best from all
systems and then advances further than anyone has yet done&rdquo; (NE,
p. 71).</p>

<p>
Before looking at the way he attempts to advance moral philosophy and
the theory of the good, it will help to have some background
concerning what Leibniz calls the <em>metaphysical good</em> and its
correlative <em>metaphysical evil</em>. In uniting goodness with
reality, Leibniz borrows, not without putting his own stamp on it, a
view that had currency with certain medieval philosophers (e.g.,
Augustine, Boethius, and Aquinas). The doctrine nonetheless originated
in the Neoplatonic philosophy of Plotinus (204&ndash;269) and Porphyry
(234&ndash;c.305), though there is clearly suggestion of it in Plato
(e.g., <em>Republic</em> 518c, <em>Timaeus</em> 28b). In reuniting
goodness and reality, or to what he interchangeably refers to as
<em>perfection</em>, Leibniz thus characteristically recovers and
attempts to restore a doctrine that had currency among medieval
thinkers (for a study of the medieval treatment of the doctrine of
metaphysical goodness, see the essays in MacDonald (ed.) 1991).</p>

<p>
Reality (i.e., perfection) in Leibniz&rsquo;s view is not the sort of
thing that something either has or does not have. It is not an
all-or-nothing matter. Rather, perfection is scalar&mdash;it comes in
varying degrees. God has infinite perfection, the maximum amount,
because He is limitless (PE, &ldquo;Monadology,&rdquo; &sect;41).
Every existent other than God, including the universe, possesses a
limited degree of perfection. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; as Leibniz explains,
&ldquo;God could not give the creature all without making of it a God;
therefore there must needs be different degrees in the perfection of
things, and limitations also of every kind&rdquo; (T &sect;31, p.
142). Because nothing but God is infinite, everything else exhibits
metaphysical perfection in varying, limited degrees.</p>

<p>
Since everything but God exhibits a finite level of perfection,
everything but God also exhibits a degree of imperfection, some
privation of reality. Privation of reality necessarily belongs to
creation in the sense that it is logically impossible for a created
thing to be unlimited (PE, &ldquo;Principles of Nature and Grace,
Based on Reason,&rdquo; &sect;9; T &sect;20, p. 135). Only that whose
existence is absolutely necessary and therefore depends on nothing
other than itself has infinite perfection. For Leibniz, metaphysical
evil is the privation of reality inherent in the natures of created
things (T &sect;21, p. 136) (for further reading on Leibniz&rsquo;s
conception of metaphysical evil, see Latzer 1994 and Antognazza
2014).</p>

<p>
In a letter in which he replies to an inquiry by the philosopher
Christian Wolff (1679&ndash;1754) about the concept of perfection,
Leibniz gives the following analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Perfection</em> is the harmony of things, or the state where
everything is worthy of being observed, that is, the state of
agreement [<em>consensus</em>] or identity in variety; you can even
say that it is the degree of contemplatibility
[<em>considerabilitas</em>] (PE, 18 May 1715, p. 233&ndash;4).
</blockquote>

<p>
This indicates that there are in a sense two aspects of metaphysical
perfection. First, metaphysical perfection is constituted by harmony,
that is, unity in variety. A situation is harmonious to the extent
that a variety of things are ordered in accordance with general laws
or principles, such as laws of motion governing terrestrial and
celestial objects (PE, &ldquo;Principles of Nature and Grace, Based on
Reason,&rdquo; &sect;11). Second, that which possesses a degree of
metaphysical perfection in the sense of harmony can also be said to be
worthy of observation to some extent. If there were nothing ordered in
accordance with general laws, there would be nothing worthy of
observation because everything would be submerged in chaos. Thus
harmony makes something contemplatible, like a painting by the Italian
Renaissance artist Raphael (PW, &ldquo;Codex Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p.
171).</p>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics is therefore perfectionist in two distinct but
related senses. On the one hand, the metaphysical good consists in the
reality of a thing, its degree of metaphysical perfection, which is
identical to its harmony. This may be called <em>metaphysical
perfectionism</em>. On the other hand, Leibniz maintains that moral
goodness involves the development and perfection of a characteristic
or set of characteristics fundamental to human nature. Such a
characteristic in a cultivated state is called a virtue. This is
<em>moral perfectionism</em>. For Leibniz, metaphysical perfection is
a necessary condition for moral perfection in that intellectual
apprehension of harmony gives rise to moral perfection.</p>

<p>
To see how he arrives at this position, it is necessary to return to
the other two types of goodness: the moral good and the physical good.
&ldquo;Virtue,&rdquo; according to Leibniz, &ldquo;is the habit of
acting according to wisdom&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo;
&sect;1, p. 83). Yet one virtue in particular reigns supreme and
contains all the others, and that virtue is justice, which Leibniz
defines as the &ldquo;charity of the wise man&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Codex
Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 171; cf. PW, p. 57 &amp; p. 83). One whose
love is guided by wisdom possesses the charity of the wise. Love is
the pleasure one takes in the happiness and perfection of others (PW,
&ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo; &sect;5; NE, p. 163). God&rsquo;s wisdom is
infinite and His love is universal, extending to all beings capable of
happiness. God&rsquo;s universal benevolence, Leibniz suggests, is an
ideal we ought to do our best to imitate and continuously aspire to
(PW, &ldquo;Meditation on the Common Concept of Justice&rdquo;, pp.
57&ndash;8; cf. PE, &ldquo;Principles of Nature and Grace, Based on
Reason,&rdquo; &sect;14, pp. 211&ndash;12). The more one&rsquo;s
benevolence expands to encompass the happiness of more and more
others, the more one grows in justice and virtue, thereby increasing
in moral goodness (for further reading on Leibniz&rsquo;s view of
justice as the charity of the wise, see Riley 1996 (Chapter 4) and
2003).</p>

<p>
The physical good thus bridges the moral good with the metaphysical
good. It links virtue and harmony because, for Leibniz, pleasure is
the perception or knowledge of perfection. Pain, on the other hand, is
the perception or knowledge of imperfection (NE, p. 194; PW,
&ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo; &sect;4). A sensual pleasure, such as the
pleasure of listening to music or that of viewing a painting, is a
confused perception of perfection (i.e., a confused perception of
harmony). In contrast, an intellectual pleasure, such as the pleasure
of knowing the fundamental order of reality, is a distinct perception
of perfection. Sensual pleasures in some cases approximate
intellectual pleasures, but they inevitably fall short because they
tend to be deceptive and transitory, whereas intellectual pleasures
are pure and lasting, and true happiness, according to Leibniz, is
simply a lasting state of pleasure (PW, &ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo;
&sect;3; NE, p. 194).</p>

<p>
Despite his identification of happiness with lasting pleasure,
however, it is an oversimplification to characterize Leibniz&rsquo;s
theory of the good as nothing more than a form of hedonism. Given that
pleasure is a confused or distinct apprehension of harmony, knowledge
serves as the necessary means by which an individual cultivates the
moral good, the charity of the wise. Knowledge of the perfection of
others, of the perfection of the universe, and of God, the perfect
being, is inherently pleasurable and concomitantly contributes to the
proper order of one&rsquo;s character by generating love in conformity
with wisdom.</p>

<p>
The harmony of the universe then is a precondition for virtue and
happiness, but harmony alone is not sufficient. Knowledge is also
necessary. If there were no minds, or if there were no minds capable
of knowledge, the universe would be devoid of virtue and happiness.
Thus knowledge unifies Leibniz&rsquo;s composite theory of the good.
He says,</p>

<blockquote>
&sect;15. One must hold as certain that the more a mind desires to
know order, reason, the beauty of things which God has produced, and
the more he is moved to imitate this order in the things which God has
left to his direction, the happier he will be.

<p>
&sect;16. It is most true, as a result, that one cannot know God
without loving one&rsquo;s brother, that one cannot have wisdom
without having charity (which is the real touchstone of virtue), and
that one even advances one&rsquo;s own good in working for that of
others&hellip;. (PW, &ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo; p. 84)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The intellectualist cast of Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics stands out
unmistakably in this passage. Knowledge of the order, rationality, and
beauty of creation is necessary for happiness. So too is actively
imitating that order. Together, they are sufficient. Without
knowledge, action and the effort to promote the perfection of others
do not necessarily meet with success and may even backfire, leading to
greater physical evil. Without actively promoting rational order,
knowledge alone does not lead to happiness. Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics no
doubt has an intellectualist character, but mere passive contemplation
of the rational order of the universe is not the ideal of moral
goodness. Instead, moral goodness combines knowledge of the rational
order with the active promotion of rational order as far as possible
(for a discussion of Leibniz&rsquo;s view of the role of divine grace
in the attainment of salvation, see Rutherford 2014).</p>

<h2 id="NatLawThe">2. Natural Law Theory</h2>

<p>
So far we have seen that, for Leibniz, the human good consists in the
lasting state of pleasure that accompanies moral perfection. Moral
perfection, in turn, is cultivated through the perpetual pursuit and
acquisition of knowledge of the perfection of others, the universe,
and God. Although all knowledge contributes to moral perfection and is
therefore practical in a broad sense of the term, ethics nevertheless
is a distinct branch of science, capable of the same level of
demonstrative rigor as arithmetic and geometry (NE, Preface, p. 50;
PW, &ldquo;Meditation on the Common Concept of Justice,&rdquo; pp.
49&ndash;50). Leibniz shares this view of ethics with other important
seventeenth-century thinkers, such as Hobbes (1588&ndash;1679),
Spinoza (1632&ndash;1677), and Locke (1632&ndash;1704). And although
Leibniz never wrote a comprehensive ethical treatise in the
geometrical style, it is clear from what he left us that, in addition
to a naturalistic-metaphysical theory of the good, ethical science
also includes a science of natural law.</p>

<p>
As a natural law theorist, Leibniz holds that compliance with the set
of universal ethical principles that make up the natural law is
necessary and sufficient to achieve the good. Also, like the eminent
modern natural lawyer Hugo Grotius (1583&ndash;1645), whom Leibniz
greatly admired&mdash;referring to him as the &ldquo;incomparable
Grotius&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Opinion on the Principles of
Pufendorf,&rdquo; p. 65; T &sect;6, p. 77), he believes that the
natural law and the obligation to comply with it are independent of
God&rsquo;s will. It is not possible, in other words, for God to have
legislated a different set of moral absolutes than those that obtain;
nor do the moral absolutes derive their obligatory authority from
having been legislated by God. According to Leibniz,</p>

<blockquote>
Neither the norm of conduct itself, nor the essence of the just,
depends on his [God&rsquo;s] free decision, but rather on eternal
truths, objects of the divine intellect, which constitute, so to
speak, the essence of divinity itself. . . . And, indeed, justice
follows certain rules of equality and of proportion [which are] no
less founded in the immutable nature of things, and in the divine
ideas, than are the principles of arithmetic and of geometry (PW,
&ldquo;Opinion on the Principles of Pufendorf,&rdquo; p. 71).
</blockquote>

<p>
The concept of justice in Leibniz&rsquo;s view is fixed independent of
God&rsquo;s choice, and so God has no more power to alter the nature
of justice than He does to alter the nature of circularity.</p>

<p>
The idea that justice and moral obligation do not depend on a free
decree of God is a significant doctrine in Leibniz&rsquo;s philosophy.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a focal point of debate
in moral philosophy centered on a version of the <em>Euthyphro</em>
problem&mdash;between those who sided with Grotius and Leibniz in
holding that moral goodness and obligation do not depend on
God&rsquo;s will and those who held the opposite view, that moral
goodness and obligation are as they are as a result of God&rsquo;s
free choice. Two of the most important seventeenth-century proponents
of the latter, voluntarist position are Thomas Hobbes and Samuel
Pufendorf (1632&ndash;1694). Leibniz&rsquo;s objections to voluntarism
became widely known in the early eighteenth century when a letter he
wrote attacking voluntarism was appended to a new edition of
Pufendorf&rsquo;s <em>The Duty of Man and Citizen</em> (1718). This
anti-voluntarist tract, &ldquo;Opinion on the Principles of
Pufendorf&rdquo; (written in 1706), contains one of his fullest
discussions of justice. A full treatment of Leibniz&rsquo;s
anti-voluntarism would take us too far afield, but a central criticism
is that, in regarding moral goodness and obligation as dependent on
God&rsquo;s free choice, voluntarism undermines the basis for our love
of God (PW, &ldquo;Opinion on the Principles of Pufendorf,&rdquo; p.
71&ndash;2). If, as the voluntarist holds, moral goodness is an
artifact of God, it is not an essential attribute of the divine
nature. God therefore cannot be loved for His goodness. Voluntarism
thus subverts morality and religion because love of God is essential
to both (for more in depth discussions of Leibniz&rsquo;s
anti-voluntarism, see Schneewind 1998 (250&ndash;259) and Haakonssen
1996 (46&ndash;9)).</p>

<p>
Following a current in the natural law tradition, Leibniz supplements
his account of justice as the charity of the wise with three
principles handed down from Roman law via Justinian&rsquo;s
<em>Institutes</em> (533 AD). The three principles are &ldquo;to hurt
no one&rdquo; (<em>neminem laedere)</em>, &ldquo;to give each his
due&rdquo; (<em>suum cuique tribuere)</em>, and &ldquo;to live
honorably&rdquo; (<em>honeste vivere)</em> or, as Leibniz glosses it,
to live piously. Leibniz suggests that these principles underwrite
three distinct degrees of justice (PW, &ldquo;Codex Iuris
Gentium,&rdquo; pp. 171&ndash;2). The lowest degree is &ldquo;strict
right&rdquo; (<em>ius strictum</em>), which has as its precept that
&ldquo;no one is to be injured, so that he will not be given a motive
for a legal action within the state, nor outside the state a right of
war&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Codex Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 172). Strict
right primarily includes a bare minimum set of negative duties, such
as the duties not to harm, not to murder, and not to commit theft. The
function of this degree of justice is the &ldquo;conservation of
peace.&rdquo; The second degree Leibniz calls &ldquo;equity&rdquo; or
&ldquo;charity&rdquo; in the narrow sense of the term, which has its
basis in the principle &ldquo;to give each his due.&rdquo; This grade
of justice includes, for example, duties of gratitude and of
charitable donation, things we owe to others but which failure to
fulfill is not sanctioned by law. Whereas strict right functions
merely to avoid misery by fostering peace, the duties of equity
actively promote the happiness of others as far as possible within
this life.</p>

<p>
Strict right and equity, he explains, correspond to Grotius&rsquo;
distinction between perfect and imperfect rights (PW, &ldquo;Codex
Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 172). Unlike Grotius, however, Leibniz views
this distinction as one of degree rather than as one of kind. Also,
equity, the second grade of justice, comprehends strict right within
its scope, and strict right and equity are comprehended under the
third and highest grade of justice, namely, piety.</p>

<p>
The principle of piety is &ldquo;to live honorably.&rdquo; An
important difference between strict right and equity, on the one hand,
and piety, on the other, is that the former pertain to our pursuit of
goods and avoidance of evils over the course of our natural lives
while the latter pertains to our pursuit of goods and avoidance of
evils throughout our entire lives, that is, over the whole course of
our immortal existence. The third grade of justice thus relies on two
central tenets of Leibniz&rsquo;s metaphysics, for which he believes
there are demonstrative proofs; indeed, he believes he provides such
proofs (PE, &ldquo;Principles of Nature and Grace, Based on
Reason,&rdquo; &sect;4, &sect;8; PE, &ldquo;Monadology,&rdquo;
&sect;4, &sect;38). The tenets on which this account relies are (1)
that the soul is immortal and (2) that God is the ruler of the
universe. Most relevant to our purpose are not the arguments he
supplies in support of these but, rather, the work that the theses do
in his account of piety.</p>

<p>
A person is pious in Leibniz&rsquo;s sense of the term in virtue of
being perfectly just, which means that the pious person loves others
in conformity with wisdom. But it is extremely difficult to fully
realize this ideal love so long as one&rsquo;s outlook is restricted
to the goods and evils that may be encountered in one&rsquo;s natural
life. If one&rsquo;s outlook is limited to this life, one may come to
fulfill the first and second grades of justice without too much
difficulty, but rarely does anyone achieve the highest level of
justice without consideration of the soul&rsquo;s immortality and
God&rsquo;s governance (PW, &ldquo;Codex Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 173;
PW, &ldquo;Meditation on the Common Concept of Justice,&rdquo; p. 58).
This is because, even though the virtuous person&rsquo;s
&ldquo;interior harmony&rdquo; is intrinsically pleasing, most are
unable to appreciate virtue due to the fact that, from the perspective
of mortality, virtuous actions often go unrewarded while vicious ones
go unpunished. Thus most people will not bear tremendous hardships for
the sake of virtue. Only the most exceptional individuals are willing
to be virtuous and do the right thing at any mortal cost. And this
very willingness, this &ldquo;spiritual disposition&rdquo; as Leibniz
calls it, constitutes piety (PW, &ldquo;Meditation on the Common
Concept of Justice,&rdquo; p. 58).</p>

<p>
In the opening chapter of his dialogue between himself, represented by
<em>Theophilus</em>, and a spokesperson for Locke, named
<em>Philalethes</em>, Leibniz makes the following autobiographical
remark:</p>

<blockquote>
You [Philalethes] had more to do with the speculative philosophers,
while I was more inclined towards moral questions. <em>But I have been
learning, more and more, how greatly morality can be strengthened by
the solid principles of true philosophy</em>; which is why I have
lately been studying them more intensively, and have started on some
quite new trains of thought (NE, p. 71, emphasis added).
</blockquote>

<p>
We are now in a position to see how specifically the solid principles
of philosophy strengthen morality. True philosophy (i.e., sound
metaphysics) aids morality by providing grounds for assurance that in
the end happiness is directly proportioned to merit. The more virtuous
one is, the greater the happiness one can expect because one&rsquo;s
well-being does not completely depend on the goods of this life and
because it is incompatible with God&rsquo;s universal benevolence and
infinite wisdom that even a single virtuous deed should go unrewarded
and a vicious one unpunished. &ldquo;After this,&rdquo; Leibniz
concludes, &ldquo;it must be imprudent not to be just, because no one
will fail to derive good or evil from what he will have done,
according as it is just or unjust&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Meditation on the
Common Concept of Justice,&rdquo; pp. 58&ndash;9). Even though
exceptional individuals may be able to remain virtuous at any apparent
mortal cost, it follows from Leibniz&rsquo;s metaphysics that there is
in fact no mortal price to pay for being virtuous. On the contrary,
virtue is necessary and sufficient for true happiness (for further
reading on Leibniz&rsquo;s natural law theory, see Brown 1995 and
2011a).</p>

<h2 id="MorPsy">3. Moral Psychology</h2>

<p>
Leibniz believes that enlightened self-interest is in complete
agreement with the requirements of virtue. The cornerstone of this
harmony between interest and morality is metaphysics, his doctrines
concerning the soul&rsquo;s immortality and God&rsquo;s governance.
Still, the virtuous person does not regard right action and the
well-being of others as a means to his or her own happiness. According
to Leibniz,</p>

<blockquote>
Thus he who acts well, not out of hope or fear, but by an inclination
of his soul, is so far from not behaving justly that, on the contrary,
he acts more justly than all others, imitating, in a certain way, as a
man, divine justice. Whoever, indeed, does good out of love for God or
of his neighbor, takes pleasure precisely in the action itself (such
being the nature of love) and does not need any other incitement, or
the command of a superior; for that man the saying that the law is not
made for the just is valid (PW, &ldquo;Opinion on the Principles of
Pufendorf,&rdquo; p. 72).
</blockquote>

<p>
Not self-love but love of others motivates the virtuous person, or
what Leibniz calls &ldquo;disinterested love&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Codex
Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 171). Metaphysics thus strengthens morality
without overhauling it. In revealing that virtue alone ultimately
satisfies self-interest, true philosophy guides us steadfastly along
the path to virtue. Yet the truly virtuous person performs a morally
right action for its own sake.</p>

<p>
Disinterested love is not completely selfless however. Nor can it
consistently be on Leibniz&rsquo;s view since he subscribes to a
version of psychological egoism; &ldquo;for we do all for our own
good,&rdquo; he maintains, &ldquo;and it is impossible for us to have
other feelings whatever we may say&rdquo; (W, &ldquo;Letter to
Nicaise,&rdquo; p. 565). In his account of disinterested love, Leibniz
in fact seeks to reconcile egoism and altruism, and, in doing so,
anticipates Bishop Butler&rsquo;s (1692&ndash;1752) landmark attack
against psychological egoism (BM1, <em>Fifteen Sermons</em> (1726),
pp. 364&ndash;373).</p>

<p>
The key to Leibniz&rsquo;s reconciliation is a distinction between the
pleasure involved in the satisfaction of a desire and the object of a
desire. Desires spur all human actions. Some desires emerge distinctly
in conscious awareness while many do not, or do so only confusedly.
The former he calls <em>volitions</em> and the latter
<em>appetitions</em> (NE, p. 173). Satisfaction of any desire gives
its subject at least a minimal degree of pleasure, however fleeting.
An unfulfilled volition causes at a minimum enough suffering for one
to be aware of it, but an unfulfilled appetition, by contrast, gives
rise to &ldquo;semi-suffering,&rdquo; or what he calls, following
Locke, &ldquo;uneasiness&rdquo; (NE, p. 188&ndash;9). Such
semi-suffering, Leibniz explains, &ldquo;does not amount to
discomfort, but is restricted to the elements or rudiments of
suffering, which we cannot be aware of in themselves but which suffice
to act as spurs and to stimulate the will&rdquo; (NE, p. 189). No
finite being is ever totally free of semi-sufferings and, to a lesser
degree, semi-pleasures. Even where we appear to ourselves to be
completely indifferent about our options, unconscious desires move us
toward one course of action rather than another (NE, p. 188).</p>

<p>
Every desire inclines one to joy, its immediate satisfaction and the
transitory pleasure arising therefrom. Moreover, Leibniz takes it as
axiomatic that no one pursues anything but what appears to him or her
to be the greatest good (NE, p. 185; T &sect;45, p. 148). Failure to
be virtuous and achieve happiness is therefore a consequence of
ignorance, error, or inattention to what one knows. Inattention
results from a lapse in the ability to call to mind the knowledge one
possesses, and this, according to Leibniz, accounts for the puzzling
psychological phenomenon known as weakness of will (NE, pp.
186&ndash;187). Weakness of will, it turns out, is a type of
forgetfulness. As such, an individual has some control over it, albeit
indirectly. Upbringing and education certainly affect an
individual&rsquo;s ability to bring specific thoughts to mind, but
steps may be taken to ensure that certain considerations rather than
others occur to one in practical deliberation (NE, p. 187 &amp; pp.
195&ndash;196). For example, Leibniz counsels,</p>

<blockquote>
Thus when a man is in a good frame of mind he ought to make himself
laws and rules for the future, and then carry them out strictly,
drawing himself away&ndash;abruptly or gradually, depending on the
nature of the case&ndash;from situations which are capable of
corrupting him. A lover will be cured by a voyage undertaken just for
that purpose; a period of seclusion will stop us from keeping company
with people who confirm some bad disposition in us. (NE, p. 187)
</blockquote>

<p>
Advance preparation is the key to strength of will. An individual
needs to equip him- or herself with principles and appropriate habits
of thought in order to make correct choices in pressure situations.
Otherwise, he or she is merely an instrument of conscious and
unconscious inclinations (for a discussion of Leibniz&rsquo;s view of
practical rationality see Roinila 2008).</p>

<p>
Recall that true happiness is a lasting state of pleasure. The most
direct route to happiness, as commonsense testifies, is not through
the gratification of every desire that happens to occur to one.
Volitions and appetitions must be moderated by experience and reason
(NE, p. 189). Experience and reason teach us to neglect or postpone
fulfillment of some desires so that others may be fulfilled instead,
the most valuable among them being those that reason gives us (NE, p.
194&ndash;5). Reason generates inclinations whose strength and objects
are distinct, as opposed to bodily inclinations whose strength and
objects are confused. The confusion inherent in bodily inclinations
makes their fulfillment considerably more problematic than that of
rational inclinations. The bodily desire for nourishment, for example,
may be satisfied by eating a piece of fruit, but, as Leibniz points
out, &ldquo;a fruit with a good taste and a good odor can conceal a
poison&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Felicity,&rdquo; &sect;6a, p. 83).
Fulfillment of confused bodily inclinations may, and too often does,
lead to pain and suffering further on. Such however is not the case
with rational inclinations. Distinct knowledge, which is a distinct
perception of harmony, satisfies the distinct inclinations of reason.
And since the universe is maximally harmonious, there is no end to the
pleasure we can derive from the acquisition of distinct knowledge.</p>

<p>
All desires, no matter how confused or distinct, incline one toward
the pleasure one takes in their satisfaction. Leibniz then can be
understood as subscribing to psychological egoism where by this is
meant that a person does all to satisfy one or more of his or her own
inclinations. But it does not follow that all inclinations are
alike&mdash;that, say, all of one&rsquo;s desires have one&rsquo;s own
pleasure as their object. This is where the egoist goes wrong and
where Leibniz finds room for accommodating both egoism and altruism.
What all actions have in common is that they are spurred by an
inclination of the agent, the satisfaction of which gives him or her
pleasure. But the same type of object does not satisfy all
inclinations alike. For Leibniz, some inclinations have confused
sensible objects, such as the sweetness of fruit, the melody of a
song, or the beauty of a painting. Others have distinct intellectual
objects, such as the perfection of God, of the natural world, or of
another human being. A sweet piece of fruit cannot satisfy a desire
for perfection in the natural world any more than a distinct
perception of harmony in the natural world can satisfy a bodily desire
for nourishment. Different inclinations concern different objects.</p>

<p>
To be inclined toward the perfection of another rational being is to
be disposed to take pleasure in their perfection. Notice however that
the object of the inclination, that which one&rsquo;s view is fixed
on, is not one&rsquo;s own pleasure. This does not mean that an
individual&rsquo;s own pleasure cannot be the object of one of his or
her desires. For most, self-love may be their predominant motive.
Nevertheless, an individual can have an other-directed desire for the
perfection of another rational being, which is to have disinterested
love. To love disinterestedly, Leibniz explains, is to be
&ldquo;disposed to take pleasure in the perfection, well-being or
happiness of the object of one&rsquo;s love. And this involves not
thinking about or asking for any pleasure of one&rsquo;s own except
what one can get from the happiness or pleasure of the loved
one&rdquo; (NE, p. 163). Since happiness is the outward manifestation
of perfection, it makes no real difference whether love is said to
have the perfection or the happiness of another rational being as its
object. Leibniz thus makes the insightful suggestion that, though we
do everything we do out of an inclination whose satisfaction gives us
pleasure, this is perfectly compatible with desiring the perfection of
another without any other end in view, which actually occurs whenever
the object of our desire is another&rsquo;s perfection or happiness.
&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; Leibniz concludes, &ldquo;the happiness of
those whose happiness pleases us turns into our own happiness, since
things which please us are desired for their own sake&rdquo; (PW,
&ldquo;Codex Iuris Gentium,&rdquo; p. 171) (for further reading on
Leibniz&rsquo;s conception of disinterested love, see Brown
2011b).</p>

<p>
Genuine altruism, then, does not require complete selflessness.
Indeed, selflessness, even if it were possible, would not be desirable
(W, &ldquo;Letter to Nicaise,&rdquo; p. 566). After all, according to
Leibniz,</p>

<blockquote>
One cannot envisage in God any other motive than that of perfection,
or, if you like, of his pleasure; supposing (according to my
definition) that pleasure is nothing but a feeling of perfection, he
has nothing to consider outside himself; on the contrary everything
depends on him. But his goodness would not be supreme, if he did not
aim at the good and at perfection so far as is possible. But what will
one say, if I show that this same motive has a place in truly virtuous
and generous men, whose supreme function [<em>degr&eacute;</em>] is to
imitate divinity, in so far as human nature is capable of it? (PW,
&ldquo;Meditation on the Common Concept of Justice,&rdquo; pp.
57&ndash;8).
</blockquote>

<p>
Imitate divinity&mdash;this is the overarching imperative of
Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics, if not the guiding principle of his entire
philosophical system. For him, God, not humanity, is the
&ldquo;measure of all things&rdquo; (PW, &ldquo;Opinion on the
Principles of Pufendorf,&rdquo; p. 69). Our chief task therefore is to
make perpetual progress toward the ideal of divine nature, for each of
us is like a little divinity in the City of God (PE,
&ldquo;Monadology,&rdquo; &sect;83 &amp; &sect;85, pp. 223&ndash;4; T
&sect;147, pp. 215&ndash;216).</p>

<h2 id="Pro">4. Progress</h2>

<p>
An interpretive issue in Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics concerns the
relationship between his optimism and views on progress. Leibniz tells
Wedderkopf that &ldquo;whatever has happened, is happening, or will
happen is best&rdquo; (L, p. 147; See also <em>Discourse</em>
&sect;3). But a famous objection to Leibniz&rsquo;s optimism is that
the world could have been constructed in a better manner, and at they
very least in terms of morality and the human condition, the world
could and should be able to get better over time. As such, the
interpretive issue is whether Leibniz&rsquo;s optimism implies that
the best of all possible worlds is <em>maximally perfect</em> with
respect to all perfections from moment to moment or whether there can
be <em>progress in perfection</em> over time. In particular,
considering Leibniz&rsquo;s ethics, can there be <em>moral
progress</em> in the best of all possible worlds? That is, net
increases in happiness and virtue for rational minds or substances
(and corresponding decreases in their suffering and vice)? </p>

<p>
One inroad into this issue comes from considering the various
perfections the best of all possible worlds is supposed to
instantiate. Leibniz distinguishes between three types of perfection
(<em>Theodicy</em>, T: 258): <em>metaphysical perfection
</em>(harmony, quantity of essence, knowledge, etc.), <em>physical
perfection </em>(happiness), and <em>moral perfection </em>(virtue).
Leibniz is sometimes unclear about God&rsquo;s criteria in evaluating
and instantiating these perfections in the best of all possible
worlds. Are all of these perfections maximized or do some take
precedence over others? That is, is God faced with a conflict of goods
in selecting the best of all possible worlds? </p>

<p>
In some texts, Leibniz emphasizes metaphysical perfection in
God&rsquo;s selection: &ldquo;God has chosen the most perfect world,
that is the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypotheses
and the richest in phenomena&rdquo; (PE, <em>Discourse</em> &sect; 6,
p. 39). On this view, our world is the best because it has been
metaphysically constructed in the most optimal way (Couturat 1901, p.
237). However, in other texts, Leibniz suggests that God&rsquo;s
principal aim in creating the world was to maximize physical and moral
perfection (happiness and virtue) for rational minds. For example,
Leibniz writes, &ldquo;the entire universe is made for minds, such
that it can contribute to their happiness as much as possible&rdquo;
(PW, <em>Memoir for Enlightened Persons of Good Intention</em>, p.
105, see also <em>Discourse </em>&sect; 36; see also Grua 1953, pp.
338&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
One solution to this problem, offered by Rutherford, is found in
Leibniz&rsquo;s views on progress in the kingdom of grace. Leibniz
writes in <em>On the Ultimate Origination of Things</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
[W]e must also recognize a certain constant and unbounded progress in
the whole universe, so that it always proceeds to greater development,
just as a large portion of our world is now cultivated and will become
more and more so. (PE, p. 154)
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, he writes in a 1706 Letter to Electress Sophie:</p>

<blockquote>
And just as there are grounds to think that the universe itself
develops more and more, and that everything tends towards some goal
(since everything comes from an author whose wisdom is perfect) it can
likewise be believed that souls, which endure as long as the universe,
also proceed to get better and better (at least physically), and that
their perfections carry on growing; although more often than not this
happens only insensibly, and sometimes after large steps backwards.
(SLT, p. 83)
</blockquote>

<p>
And in the <em>Principles of Nature and Grace</em>, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
Our happiness will never consist, and must never consist, in complete
joy, in which nothing is left to desire, and which would dull our
mind, but must consist in a perpetual progress to new pleasures and
new perfections. (PE: 213; see also <em>Theodicy</em>, p. 379)
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Rutherford, such texts show that the world must realize
maximal degrees of physical and moral perfection <em>over time</em>.
Indeed, in the case of the physical and moral perfections of rational
minds, it is not possible for the world to initially realize maximal
degrees of happiness and virtue, for these perfections depend on the
actions of rational minds, which are not all conscious and active from
the world&rsquo;s inception. Thus God selects the world where rational
minds freely and collectively choose to realize their happiness and
virtue. </p>

<p>
For a rational mind, its increase in moral and physical perfection
depends on increases in metaphysical perfection, that is,
<em>knowledge</em> or clear and distinct expression of the world:
&ldquo;creatures possess greater moral perfection only to the extent
that they possess greater metaphysical perfection&mdash;in particular,
a more developed intellect, which serves as the foundation for both
virtue and happiness&rdquo; (1995: 47). As such, Rutherford writes
that God reserves &ldquo;their [rational minds] final enlightenment
and the final perfection of the universe as a whole, for some distant
future&rdquo; (1995, p. 52)</p>

<p>
Other commentators, however, maintain that Leibniz is committed to the
world being <em>static</em> in perfection, that is, not increasing in
any of the perfections from moment to moment (Look 2007; Strickland
2006a and 2006b; cf. Phemister 2006). Indeed, there are texts where
Leibniz suggests such a view. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
The question is whether the whole world increases or decreases in
perfection, or whether in fact it always preserves the same
perfection, as I rather think, even if the different parts variously
exchange perfections between themselves, so that it is mutually
transferred. (SLT, p. 196)
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz seems to have metaphysical grounds for denying that the world
as a whole can increase in perfection. The perfection of the world
seems to be a sum of the perfection of individual substances. Given
that the world contains all compossible substances from its inception,
it cannot increase by new substances being added to the world
(Strickland 2006a). In order for the world as a whole to increase in
perfection, then, individual substances must increase in
perfection.</p>

<p>
However, while it may be possible for individual substances to
increase in perfection (cf. Phemister 2006), it may not be possible
for substances to collectively increase in perfection, because an
increase in perfection of one substance may require the decrease in
perfection of another substance. This is due to Leibniz&rsquo;s
metaphysics of activity and passivity, and his more general theory of
the relationship between causation, power, and perfection. In the
<em>Discourse </em>&sect;15, for example, Leibniz writes: </p>

<blockquote>
For it can happen that a change that increases the expression of one
diminishes that of another&hellip;Therefore, when a change takes place
by which several substances are affected (in fact every change affects
all of them), I believe one may say that the substance which
immediately passes to a great degree of perfection or to a more
perfect expression exercises its power and acts, an the substance
which passes to a lesser degree shows its weakness and is <em>acted
upon</em>. I also hold that every action of a substance which has
perfection involves some <em>pleasure</em>, and every passions some
<em>pain</em> and vice versa. (PE: 48)
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, Leibniz writes in the <em>Monadology </em>&sect;5 2that
&ldquo;actions and passions among creatures are mutual&rdquo; (PE, p.
219). According to Look (2007), what Leibniz is fundamentally
expressing in such texts is a <em>conservation law for perfection:
</em>For any substances <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in the agent-patient
rational, if substance <em>x</em> acts and thereby increases in
perfection, substance <em>y</em> must thereby proportionally decrease
in perfection. On Look&rsquo;s interpretation of Leibniz&rsquo;s
idealism, everything in the universe is composed of the same type of
thing (simple mind-like substances or monads); and consequently, all
beings must be subject to the same laws. The moral and physical
perfections of rational substances, then, cannot be exempt from the
general laws that govern substances, which include the conservation
law. </p>

<p>
While there is certainly a tension in Leibniz&rsquo;s views on
progress (see Phemister 2006 for a reconciliation of these views), it
is clear that Leibniz has differing views on the progress of the world
throughout his writings. Indeed, Leibniz&rsquo;s last statement on
progress suggests uncertainty about the matter. In a 1715 letter to
Bourguet Leibniz writes regarding progress that &ldquo;two hypotheses
can be formed, one that nature is always equally perfect, the other
that it always increases in perfection&rdquo; but that he can not
&ldquo;see a way of showing demonstratively by pure reason which of
these we should choose&rdquo; (SLT: 198). According to Strickland,
however, Leibniz&rsquo;s indecision is not really odd at all, for with
the fates of an infinity of creatures to take into consideration even
a superlative mathematician like Leibniz was at a loss to calculate
whether the infinite gains made by the minority of creatures either
balanced or outweighed the finite losses incurred by the majority of
others. (2006a: 135; Cf. Futch 2008)</p>

<h2 id="CriCarEth">5. Criticisms of Cartesian Ethics</h2>

<p>
In a letter to Molanus (ca. 1679), Leibniz famously writes that
&ldquo;Descartes has not much advanced the practice of
morality,&rdquo; for he has effectively reproduced the ethics of the
Stoics and Epicureans (PE: 241). Leibniz&rsquo;s issue with the ethics
of Descartes, who he considers a member of &ldquo;the sect of new
Stoics,&rdquo; is not merely its lack of novelty (<em>Two Sects of
Naturalists</em>, PE: 282). Rather, his disdain for Descartes&rsquo;
ethics (and by extension aspects of Stoicism) is that it can only
offer the moral agent <em>patience without hope</em> (in short, a
prevention of the moral agent&rsquo;s happiness) because
Descartes&rsquo; metaphysics is one that precludes God&rsquo;s wisdom,
goodness, and justice. This is unlike Leibniz&rsquo;s own metaphysical
and ethical system, which he claims does offer the possibility of
hope:</p>

<blockquote>
One can even say that the love of God gives us, in the present, a
foretaste of future felicity&hellip; For it gives us perfect
confidence in the goodness of our author and master, which produces
real tranquility of mind, unlike the Stoics, who are forced to be
patient, but one that is produced by present contentment, which also
assures us future happiness. (PE, <em>Principles of Nature and
Grace</em>, p. 212; see Roinila 2012 for a discussion of Leibnizian
hope)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hope in the wisdom, goodness, and justice of God is a necessary
condition for happiness because without it the moral agent would be
forced to endure the circumstances of life without knowing that the
world (and the circumstances she faces) is, at least in part, designed
for her moral benefit.</p>

<p>
In the letter to Molanus, Leibniz offers a brief characterization of
Cartesian ethics, and then proceeds to offer three main metaphysical
objections to Descartes&rsquo; ethical system based on
Descartes&rsquo; voluntarism, his denial of divine teleology, and his
views on the immortality of the soul (For a discussion of
Leibniz&rsquo;s criticisms of Stoicism in particular, see Forman 2016
and Rutherford 2003). </p>

<p>
Leibniz seems to have an adequate understanding of Descartes&rsquo;
ethics (PE, p. 241). He correctly identifies two fundamental features
of Descartes&rsquo; ethics. First, the virtuous will must be guided by
reason and knowledge of the truth (Letter to Princess Elizabeth 4
August 1645, AT IV: 267/CSMK: 258). Second, since the will is the only
thing that is within our control, we are only responsible for our
volitions (Letter to Princess Elizabeth 6 October 1645, AT IV
308/CSMK: 269; See also Letter to Queen Christina 20 November 1647, AT
V: 83/CSMK: 325). We are not responsible for things that occur outside
of our sphere of control, and thus virtue&mdash;the supreme
good&mdash;does not depend on such contingencies. Regarding this
second feature, Leibniz writes: &ldquo;That is precisely the Stoic
doctrine; it places the greatness and freedom of their much-praised
wise man in his strength of mind to do without things that do not
depend upon us, and endure things when they come in spite of
ourselves&rdquo; (PE, p. 241).</p>

<p>
The first objection concerns Descartes&rsquo; voluntarism:</p>

<blockquote>
Since Descartes&rsquo;s God, or perfect being, is not a God like the
one we imagine or hope for, that is, a God just and wise, doing
everything possible for the good of creatures&hellip;Descartes&rsquo;s
God has neither will nor understanding, since according to Descartes
he does not have the good as object of the will, nor the true as
object of the understanding. (PE, p. 242)
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s voluntarism arises out of his commitment to the
ontological simplicity of the divine essence, which requires an
identity between God&rsquo;s &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; and
&ldquo;will&rdquo;: &ldquo;there is always a single identical and
perfectly simple act by means of which he simultaneously understands,
wills and accomplishes everything&rdquo; (<em>Principles</em> I.23, AT
VIIIA: 14/CSM I: 201). Leibniz&rsquo;s problem with voluntarism is
that there are no standards of goodness by which God acts, thus making
God&rsquo;s actions arbitrary, unwise, and unjust. As Leibniz tells us
in <em>Discourse </em>&sect; 2: </p>

<blockquote>
In saying that things are not good by virtue of any rule of goodness
but solely by virtue of the will of God, it seems to me that we
unknowingly destroy all of God&rsquo;s love and all his glory. For why
praise him for what he has done if he would be equally praiseworthy in
doing the exact contrary? Where will his justice and wisdom reside if
there remains only a certain despotic power, if will holds the place
of reason, and if, according to the definition of tyrants, justice
consists in whatever pleases the most powerful? (PE, p. 36)
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo; voluntarism leads to patience without hope because if
God&rsquo;s actions are arbitrary, in that they are not guided by
perceptions of the good, then we cannot know&mdash;or at least have
hope&mdash;that God is in fact acting for the good. This is
problematic because of the limited sphere of control of the moral
agent. According to Descartes, the moral agent can only control how
she disposes of her volitions. Every state of affairs that occur
outside of her volitions is ultimately under the control of God. Thus,
while the moral agent might believe that she herself is virtuously
acting for the good, voluntarism precludes the moral agent from having
assurance that states of affairs that that fall under the purview of
God&rsquo;s control are occurring for the genuine good of creatures.
There is no real divine providence in Descartes&rsquo; system.</p>

<p>
The second objection concerns Descartes&rsquo; denial of divine
teleology:</p>

<blockquote>
He does not want his God to act in accordance with some end; this is
why he eliminates the search for final causes from philosophy, under
the clever pretext that we are not capable of knowing God&rsquo;s
ends. (PE, p. 242)
</blockquote>

<p>
Here too, Leibniz&rsquo;s interpretation of Descartes is accurate. As
Descartes tells Burman: </p>

<blockquote>
All the purposes of God are hidden from us, and it is rash to want to
plunge into them&hellip;We think of God as a sort of superman, who
thinks up such-and-such a scheme, and tries to realize it by
such-and-such a means. This is clearly quite unworthy of God. (AT V:
158/CSMK: 341; See also <em>Principles</em> I.28 AT VIIIA: 15/CSM I:
202 and <em>Principles</em> III.2, AT VIIIA: 81/CSM I: 248)
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo; denial of our knowledge of divine teleology must be
read against his account of divine simplicity. If God has ends or
purposes, it cannot in any way require a division between intellect
and will whereby God perceives an end, and then wills and acts
accordingly. This is objectionable to Leibniz, because his optimism
implies that one of God&rsquo;s main ends is to create the best of all
possible worlds. However, the Cartesian moral agent cannot have any
certainty that God created the best of all possible worlds, let alone
a good world. Again, the moral agent must hold out and be excessively
patient, and endure what comes to her. She cannot have contentment of
mind in the face of such uncertainty. </p>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s final objection is against Descartes&rsquo; views on
the immortality of the soul. One might think, in defense of Descartes,
that his views on the immortality of the soul will secure justice for
moral agents in the afterlife. Leibniz claims, however, that
&ldquo;the immortality of soul, as established by Descartes, is
useless and could not console us in any way&rdquo; (PE, p. 243).
Leibniz offers the following memory argument against Descartes:</p>

<ol>

<li>The soul must be held morally responsible for its past actions, by
God, in the afterlife. This is because God, being just, must reward
and punish souls for their past actions, in order for true justice to
obtain.</li>

<li>Memory of our past actions, in the present life, is required for
moral responsibility in the afterlife.</li>

<li>After Cartesian disembodiment, the soul will go through
innumerable changes, ultimately losing its memories of its actions
when it was embodied.</li>

<li>The Cartesian soul will not remember its past actions, and thus
cannot be held morally responsible</li>

<li>Therefore, Descartes&rsquo; account of the immortality of the soul
is inconsistent with justice.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Descartes account of the immortality of the soul also leads to
patience without hope, because if moral agents cannot be held morally
responsible for their actions in the next life, then they cannot have
any hope that they will be rewarded for their virtue. Again, Leibniz
views his ethical system as avoiding this issue, for in the kingdom of
grace &ldquo;there will be no good action that is unrewarded, no bad
action that goes unpunished, and everything must result in the
well-being of the good&rdquo; (PE, <em>Monadology</em> &sect; 90, p.
224, see also PE, <em>Discourse </em>&sect; 37, p. 68; for more on
Leibniz&rsquo;s theory of reward and punishment see Carlin 2002 and
Strickland 2009)</p>
