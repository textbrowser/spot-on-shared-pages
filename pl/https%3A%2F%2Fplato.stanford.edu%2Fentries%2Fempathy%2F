<h1>Empathy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Mar 31, 2008; substantive revision Mon Oct 6, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The concept of empathy is used to refer to a wide range of
psychological capacities that are thought of as being central for
constituting humans as social creatures, allowing us to know what
other people are thinking and feeling, to emotionally engage with
them, to share their thoughts and feelings, and to care for their
well&ndash;being. Ever since the eighteenth century, due particularly
to the influence of the writings of David Hume and Adam Smith, those
capacities have been at the center of scholarly investigations into
the underlying psychological basis of our social and moral nature.
Yet, the concept of empathy is of relatively recent intellectual
heritage. Moreover, since researchers in different disciplines have
focused their investigations on very specific aspects of the broad
range of empathy-related phenomena, one should probably not be
surprised by a certain amount of conceptual confusion and a
multiplicity of definitions associated with the empathy concept in a
number of different scientific and non-scientific discourses. The
purpose of this entry is to clarify the empathy concept by surveying
its history in various philosophical and psychological discussions and
by indicating why empathy was and should be regarded to be of such
central importance in understanding human agency in ordinary contexts,
in the human sciences, and for the constitution of ourselves as social
and moral agents. More specifically, a short historical introduction
will articulate the philosophical context within which the empathy
concept was coined, before we elaborate on how to distinguish
conceptually between the various empathy-related phenomena (sections 1
&amp; 2). Section 3 will address the contention that empathy is the
primary epistemic means for knowing other minds, the unique method
distinguishing the human from the natural sciences, and discuss
possible limitations in our ability to empathically make sense or
grasp the experiential or phenomenal perspective of others. The last
or fourth section will then focus on claims that view empathy as the
fundamental social glue and that understand empathy as the main
psychological mechanism enabling us to establish and maintain social
relations, and take an evaluative stance towards each other.</p>

<h2 id="HisInt">1. Historical Introduction</h2>

<p>
Before the psychologist Edward Titchener (1867&ndash;1927) introduced
the term &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; in 1909 into the English language as
the translation of the German term &ldquo;Einf&uuml;hlung&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;feeling into&rdquo;), &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; was the term
commonly used to refer to empathy-related phenomena. If one were to
point to a conceptual core for understanding these phenomena, it is
probably best to point to David Hume&rsquo;s dictum that &ldquo;the
minds of men are mirrors to one another,&rdquo;(Hume 1739&ndash;40
[1978], 365) since in encountering other persons, humans can resonate
with and recreate that person&rsquo;s thoughts and emotions on
different dimensions of cognitive complexity. While, as we will see,
not everybody shares such a resonance conception of empathy(some
philosophers in the phenomenological tradition emphatically reject
it), it certainly constitutes the center of Theodor Lipps&rsquo;s
understanding, who Titchener had in mind in his translation of
&ldquo;Einf&uuml;hlung&rdquo; as &ldquo;empathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Theodor Lipps (1851&ndash;1914)was also very familiar with the work of
David Hume (see the introduction to Coplan and Goldie 2011 in this
respect). More importantly, it was Theodor Lipps, whose work
transformed empathy/Einf&uuml;hlung from a concept of
nineteenth-century German aesthetics into a central category of the
philosophy of the social and human sciences. To understand this
transformation, we first need to appreciate the reasons why
philosophers of the nineteenth century thought it necessary to appeal
to empathy in order to account for our ability to appreciate natural
objects and artefacts in an aesthetic manner. According to the
dominant (even though not universally accepted) positivistic and
empiricist conception, sense data constitute the fundamental basis for
our investigation of the world. Yet from a phenomenological
perspective, our perceptual encounter with aesthetic objects and our
appreciation of them as being beautiful&mdash;our admiration of a
beautiful sunset, for example&mdash;seems to be as direct as our
perception of an object as being red or square. By appealing to the
psychological mechanisms of empathy, philosophers intended to provide
an explanatory account of the phenomenological immediacy of our
aesthetic appreciation of objects. More specifically, for Lipps, our
empathic encounter with external objects triggers inner
&ldquo;processes&rdquo; that give rise to experiences similar to ones
that I have when I engage in various activities involving the movement
of my body. Since my attention is perceptually focused on the external
object, I experience it&mdash;or I automatically project my
experiences&mdash;as being in the object. If those experiences are in
some way apprehended in a positive manner and as being in some sense
life-affirming, I perceive the object as beautiful; otherwise, as
ugly. In the first case, Lipps speaks of positive; in the latter of
negative empathy. Lipps also characterizes our experience of beauty as
&ldquo;objectified self-enjoyment,&rdquo; since we are impressed by
the &ldquo;vitality&rdquo; and &ldquo;life potentiality&rdquo; that
lies in the perceived object (Lipps 1906, 1903a,b. For the
contemporary discussion of empathy&rsquo;s role in aesthetics, see
particularly Breithaupt 2009; Coplan and Goldie 2011 (Part II); Curtis
&amp; Koch 2009; and Keen 2007. For a recent history of the empathy
concept, see also Lanzoni 2018).</p>

<p>
In his <em>Aesthetik</em>, Lipps closely links our aesthetic
perception and our perception of another embodied person as a minded
creature. The nature of aesthetic empathy is always the
&ldquo;experience of another human&rdquo; (1905, 49). We appreciate
another object as beautiful because empathy allows us to see it in
analogy to another human body. Similarly, we recognize another
organism as a minded creature because of empathy. Empathy in this
context is more specifically understood as a phenomenon of
&ldquo;inner imitation,&rdquo; where my mind mirrors the mental
activities or experiences of another person based on the observation
of their bodily activities or facial expressions. Empathy is
ultimately based on an innate disposition for motor mimicry, a fact
that is well established in the psychological literature and was
already noticed by Adam Smith (1853). Even though such a disposition
is not always externally manifested, Lipps suggests that it is always
present as an inner tendency giving rise to similar kinaesthetic
sensations in the observer as felt by the observed target. In seeing
the angry face of another person, we instinctually have a tendency to
imitate it and &ldquo;imitate&rdquo; her anger in this manner. Since
we are not aware of such tendencies, we see the anger in her face
(Lipps 1907). Although Lipps&rsquo;s primary examples of empathy focus
on the recognition of emotions expressed in bodily gestures or facial
expressions, his conception of empathy should not be understood as
being limited to such cases. As his remarks about intellectual empathy
suggest (1903b/05), he regards our recognition of all mental
activities&mdash;insofar as they are activities requiring human
effort&mdash;as being based on empathy or on inner imitation.</p>

<h2 id="AspEmpRelPheTheConDif">2. Aspects of Empathy-Related Phenomena and Their Conceptual Differentiations</h2>

<p>
In addition, the contemporary concept of empathy and current empathy
research can be understood as the merger of two distinct strands of
philosophical and psychological research traditions within which the
investigation of our empathic capacities played a major role. Starting
in the nineteenth century, empathy was discussed as the central means
of knowing other minds, answering questions about the causal
psychological mechanisms underlying our ability to know what others
are thinking and feeling, or questions about how we can epistemically
justify our psychological understanding of other people. For
twentieth-century psychologists, that meant that one defined empathy
primarily in cognitive terms as, for instance, &ldquo;the intellectual
or imaginative apprehension of another&rsquo;s condition or state of
mind,&rdquo; to use Hogan&rsquo;s (1969) terminology. Within this area
of psychological research, one is primarily interested in determining
the reliability and accuracy of our ability to perceive and recognize
other persons&rsquo; enduring personality traits, attitudes, and
values, and occurrent mental states. One also investigates the various
factors that influence empathic accuracy. One has, for example, been
interested in determining whether empathic ability depends on gender,
age, family background, intelligence, emotional stability, the nature
of interpersonal relations, or whether it depends on specific
motivations of the observer. (For a survey, see Ickes 1993 and 2003;
and Taft 1955). A more detailed account of the research on empathic
accuracy and some of its earlier methodological difficulties can be
found in the</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="cognitive.html" id="cogn">Supplementary Document: The Study of Cognitive Empathy and Empathic Accuracy</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
Harking back to eighteenth-century moral philosophy, particularly
David Hume and Adam Smith (See also Wispe 1991), psychologists also
investigated empathy&rsquo;s role in constituting us as social and
moral creatures who emotionally connect to other humans and care for
their well-being. Within this context, one primarily conceives of
empathy as an affective phenomenon having to do with human emotions
since emotions, rather than cognitive states, are generally regarded
to be intimately tied to human motivations. Anyone reading the
psychological empathy literature has to be struck by the fact that
empathy tended at times to be incredibly broadly defined. Stotland,
for instance, one of the earliest researchers who understood empathy
exclusively as an emotional phenomenon, defined it as &ldquo;an
observer&rsquo;s reacting emotionally because he perceives that
another is experiencing or is about to experience an emotion&rdquo;
(1969, 272). According to Stotland&rsquo;s definition, very diverse
emotional responses such as feeling envy, feeling annoyed, feeling
distressed, being relieved about, feeling pity, or feeling what
Germans call <em>Schadenfreude</em> (feeling joyful about the
misfortune of another) have all to be counted as empathic reactions.
Since the 1980&rsquo;s however, psychologists have fine-tuned their
understanding of empathy conceptually; thereby implicitly
acknowledging the conceptual distinctions articulated by Max Scheler
(1973) almost a century earlier. (See also the survey in the
<em>Introduction</em> to Eisenberg/Strayer 1987 and Batson 2009). One
nowadays tends to distinguish broadly between four different
empathy-related phenomena: emotional contagion, empathy proper,
sympathy, and personal distress.</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
<strong>Emotional contagion:</strong> Emotional contagion is a
resonance phenomenon of a relatively basic form. It occurs when people
start feeling similar emotions caused merely by the association with
other people. You start feeling joyful because other people around you
are joyful, or you start feeling panicky because you are in a crowd of
people feeling panicked. Emotional contagion, however, does not
require that one is aware of the fact that one experiences the
emotions because other people experience them; rather, one experiences
them primarily as one&rsquo;s own emotion (Scheler 1973, 22). A
newborn infant&rsquo;s reactive cry to the distress cry of another,
which Hoffman takes as a &ldquo;rudimentary precursor of empathic
distress&rdquo; (Hoffman 2000, 65), can probably be understood as a
phenomenon of emotional contagion, since the infant is not able to
properly distinguish between self and other.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Proper Empathy:</strong> In contrast to mere emotional
contagion, genuine empathy presupposes the ability to differentiate
between oneself and the other and an awareness that one is resonating
with or reenacting the thoughts and feelings of the other person. It
requires, for instance, that one is minimally aware of the fact that
one is having an emotional experience due to the perception of the
other&rsquo;s emotion, or more generally, due to attending to his
situation. In seeing a sad face of another and feeling sad oneself,
such a feeling of sadness should count as genuinely empathic only if
one recognizes that in feeling sad, one&rsquo;s attention is still
focused on the other and that it is not an appropriate reaction to
aspects of one&rsquo;s own life. Researchers, however, differ in
whether they understand such empathy in a narrow or broader manner.
More narrowly understood, empathy is conceived of in an affective
sense only as the vicarious sharing of an affect. Authors can differ
in how strictly they interpret the phrase of vicariously sharing an
affect. For some, it requires that the empathizers and the persons
they empathize with need to be in very similar affective states
(Coplan 2011; de Vignemont and Singer 2006; Jacob 2011). For Hoffman,
on the other hand, it is an emotional response requiring only
&ldquo;the involvement of psychological processes that make a person
have feelings that are more congruent with another&rsquo;s situation
than with his own situation&rdquo; (Hoffman 2000, 30). According to
this definition, empathy does not necessarily require that the subject
and target feel similar emotions (even though this is most often the
case). Rather, the definition also includes cases of feeling sad when
seeing a child who plays joyfully but who does not know that it has
been diagnosed with a serious illness (assuming that this is how the
other person himself or herself would feel if he or she fully
understood his or her situation). Outside the realm of a direct
perceptual encounter, such empathy also involves some appreciation of
the other person&rsquo;s emotion as an appropriate response to his or
her situation. To be happy or unhappy because one&rsquo;s child is
happy or sad should not necessarily count as an empathic emotion. It
cannot count as a vicarious emotional response if it is due to the
perception of the outside world from the perspective of the observer,
and our desire that our children should be happy. Our happiness about
the happiness of our children is not an emotional state that is more
congruent with their situation. Rather, it is an emotional response
appropriate to my own perspective on the world. In order for my
happiness or unhappiness to be genuinely empathic, it has to be
happiness or unhappiness about what makes the other person happy.
Accordingly, if I share another person&rsquo;s emotion vicariously, I
do not merely have to be in an affective state with a similar
phenomenal quality. Rather, my affective state has to be directed
toward the same intentional object. (See Sober and Wilson 1998,
231&ndash;237 and Maibom 2007. For a critical discussion of how and
whether such vicarious sharing is possible, see also Deonna 2007 and
Matravers 2018). Yet not all authors conceive of proper empathy merely
as an affective phenomenon. Particularly within the context of
investigating how we know other minds (see Goldman 2011 and Stueber
2006), empathy is more comprehensively conceived of as including not
only affective states but all states that constitute a person&rsquo;s
perspective, their emotions, value commitments, desires, but also
their cognitive states, such as their beliefs. Already, Adam Smith
(1853) constitutes a good example of such a broad understanding of
proper empathy. Finally, others suggest that it is best to distinguish
between affective sharing and perspective taking (Decety and Cowell
2015). Notice that a broad understanding of empathy (as including both
cognitive and affective states) is not equivalent to a merely
cognitive conception of empathy that one also encounters at times in
the literature. Indeed, one might wonder whether the term
&lsquo;cognitive empathy&rsquo; is in some sense a misleading one,
since it often seems to refer to our general ability to know or infer
the mental states of others, regardless of how we arrive at such
knowledge. Merely knowing or inferring that somebody is feeling sad,
because she was diagnosed with depression based on one&rsquo;s
knowledge of the nature of depression, would count as a case of
cognitive empathy (See Spaulding 2017 for a discussion of cognitive
empathy). Yet empathy tends to be associated with knowing somehow from
the inside of how a person feels or thinks, which seems to require
some sort of resonance or taking the perspective of the person we are
concerned with (For a comprehensive anthology about empathy, see also
Maibom 2017).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Sympathy:</strong> In contrast to empathy, sympathy&mdash;or
what some authors also refer to as empathic concern&mdash;is not an
emotion that is congruent with the other&rsquo;s emotion or situation,
such as feeling the sadness of the other person&rsquo;s grieving for
the death of his father. Rather, sympathy is seen as an emotion
<em>sui generis</em> that has the other&rsquo;s negative emotion or
situation as its object from the perspective of somebody who cares for
the other person&rsquo;s well-being (Darwall 1998). In this sense,
sympathy consists of &ldquo;feeling sorrow or concern for the
distressed or needy other,&rdquo; a feeling for the other out of a
&ldquo;heightened awareness of the suffering of another person as
something that needs to be alleviated.&rdquo; (Eisenberg 2000a, 678;
Wispe 1986, 318; and Wispe 1991). What we call compassion should also
be understood as a form of sympathy, a form of sympathy that is about
major calamities that befall another person. While we can sympathize
with another person&rsquo;s pain due to a paper cut, we would not call
such feelings examples of compassion (See Blum 1980, Snow 1991,
Nussbaum 2001, part II). Whereas it is quite plausible to assume that
empathy&mdash;that is, empathy with negative emotions of another or
what Hoffman (2000) calls &ldquo;veridical empathic
distress&rdquo;&mdash;under certain conditions (and when certain
developmental markers are achieved) can give rise to sympathy, it
should be stressed that the relation between affective empathy and
sympathy is a contingent one; the understanding of which requires
further empirical research. First, sympathy does not necessarily
require feeling any kind of congruent emotions on the part of the
observer; a detached recognition or representation that the other is
in need or suffers might be sufficient. (See Scheler 1973 and Nichols
2004). Second, empathy or empathic distress might not at all lead to
sympathy. People in the helping professions, who are so accustomed to
the misery of others, suffer at times from compassion fatigue. It is
also possible to experience empathic overarousal because one is
emotionally so overwhelmed by one&rsquo;s empathic feelings that one
is unable to be concerned with the suffering of the other (Hoffman
2000, chap. 8). In the later case, one&rsquo;s empathic feeling are
transformed or give rise to mere personal distress, a reactive
emotional phenomenon that needs to be distinguished from emotional
contagion, empathy, and sympathy.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Personal Distress:</strong> Personal distress in the context
of empathy research is understood as a reactive emotion in response to
the perception/recognition of another&rsquo;s negative emotion or
situation. Yet, while personal distress is <em>other-caused</em> like
sympathy, it is, in contrast to sympathy, primarily
<em>self-oriented</em>. In this case, another person&rsquo;s distress
does not make me <em>feel bad for him or her</em>, it just makes
<em>me</em> feel bad, or &ldquo;alarmed, grieved, upset, worried,
disturbed, perturbed, distressed, and troubled;&rdquo; to use the list
of adjectives that according to Batson&rsquo;s research indicates
personal distress (Batson et al. 1987 and Batson 1991). And, in
contrast to empathic emotions as defined above, my personal distress
is not any more congruent with the emotion or situation of another.
Rather, it wholly defines my own outlook on the world.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
While it is conceptually necessary to differentiate between these
various emotional responses, it has to be admitted that it is
empirically not very easy to discriminate between them, since they
tend to occur together. Think or imagine yourself attending the
funeral of the child of a friend or good acquaintance. You probably
are &ldquo;infected&rdquo; by the sadness of people around you, you
imagine how close relatives of the deceased feel, you sympathize with
their loss, but you also might be distressed about having to attend
such a sad affair, since you have very important things to attend to
in your personal life. This is probably one reason why early
researchers tended not to distinguish between the above aspects in
their study of empathy-related phenomena. Yet since the above
distinctions refer to very different psychological mechanisms, it is
central to distinguish between them when empirically assessing the
impact and contribution of empathy to an agent&rsquo;s pro-social
motivation and behavior. Given the ambiguity of the empathy concept
within psychology&mdash;particularly in the earlier
literature&mdash;in evaluating and comparing different empirical
empathy studies, it is always crucial to keep in mind how empathy has
been defined. Equally important in evaluating empirical studies, one
has to pay attention to how such abstractly defined concepts are
operationalized within these studies. For a more extensive discussion
of the methods used by psychologists to measure empathy, see the
 <a href="measuring.html" id="meas">Supplementary document on Measuring Empathy</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Notice that when we are exploring empathy in the next sections as an
epistemic means for knowing other minds (section 3) and as the basis
for human sociality and morality (section 4), we will be conceiving of
it as what we have called proper empathy above, that is, as requiring
a self-other differentiation.</p>

<h2 id="EmpKnoOthMin">3. Empathy and Knowledge of Other Minds</h2>

<h3 id="EmpTraProOthMin">3.1 Empathy and the Traditional Problem of Other Minds</h3>

<p>
It was indeed Lipps&rsquo;s claim that empathy should be understood as
the <em>primary</em> epistemic means for gaining knowledge of other
minds that was the focus of a lively debate among philosophers at the
beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Prandtl 1910, Stein 1917,
Scheler 1973). Even philosophers, who did not agree with Lipps&rsquo;s
specific explication, found the concept of empathy appealing because
his argument for his position was closely tied to a thorough critique
of what was widely seen at that time as the only alternative for
conceiving of knowledge of other minds, that is, Mill&rsquo;s
inference from analogy. Traditionally, the inference from analogy
presupposes a Cartesian conception of the mind according to which
access to our own mind is direct and infallible, whereas knowledge of
other minds is inferential, fallible, and based on evidence about
other persons&rsquo; observed physical behavior. More formally, one
can characterize the inference from analogy as consisting of the
following premises or steps.</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>Another person <em>X</em> manifests behavior of type
<em>B</em>.</li>

<li>In my own case behavior of type <em>B</em> is caused by mental
state of type <em>M</em>.</li>

<li>Since my and <em>X</em>&rsquo;s outward behavior of type
<em>B</em> is similar, it has to have similar inner mental causes. (It
is thus assumed that I and the other persons are psychologically
similar in the relevant sense.)</li>

<li>Therefore, the other person&rsquo;s behavior (<em>X</em>&rsquo;s
behavior) is caused by a mental state of type <em>M</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Like Wittgenstein, but predating him considerably, Lipps argues in his
1907 article &ldquo;Das Wissen von fremden Ichen&rdquo; that the
inference from analogy falls fundamentally short of solving the
philosophical problem of other minds. Lipps does not argue against the
inference from analogy because of its evidentially slim basis, but
because it does not allow us to understand its basic presupposition
that another person has a mind that is psychologically similar to our
own mind. The inference from analogy thus cannot be understood as
providing us with evidence for the claim that the other person has
mental states like we do because, within its Cartesian framework, we
are unable to conceive of other minds in the first place. For Lipps,
analogical reasoning requires the contradictory undertaking of
inferring another person&rsquo;s anger and sadness based on my sadness
and anger, yet to think of that sadness and anger simultaneously as
something &ldquo;absolutely different&rdquo; from my anger and
sadness. More generally, analogical inference is a contradictory
undertaking because it entails &ldquo;entertaining a completely new
thought about an I, that however is not me, but something absolutely
different&rdquo; (Lipps 1907, 708, my translation).</p>

<p>
Yet while Lipps diagnoses the problem of the inference of analogy
within the context of a Cartesian conception of the mind quite
succinctly, he fails to explain how empathy is able to provide us with
an epistemically sanctioned understanding of other minds or why our
&ldquo;feeling into&rdquo; the other person&rsquo;s mind is more than
a mere projection. More importantly, Lipps does not sufficiently
explain why empathy does not encounter similar problems to the ones
diagnosed for the inference from analogy and how empathy allows us to
conceive of other persons as having a mind similar to our own if we
are directly acquainted only with our own mental states.
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s critique of the inference from analogy is, in the
end, more penetrating because he recognizes that its problem depends
on a Cartesian account of mental concepts. If my grasp of a mental
concept is exclusively constituted by me experiencing something in a
certain way, then it is impossible for me to conceive of how that very
same concept can be applied to somebody else, given that I cannot
experience somebody else&rsquo;s mental states. I therefore cannot
conceive of how another person can be in the same mental state as I am
because that would require that I can conceive of my mental state as
something, which I do not experience. But according to the Cartesian
conception, this seems to be a conceptually impossible task. Moreover,
if one holds on to a Cartesian conception of the mind, it is not clear
how appealing to empathy, as conceived of by Lipps, should help us in
conceiving of mental states as belonging to another mind.</p>

<p>
Within the phenomenological tradition, the above shortcomings of
Lipps&rsquo;s position of empathy were quite apparent (see, for
example, Stein 1917, 24 and Scheler 1973, 236). Yet despite the fact
that they did not accept Lipps&rsquo;s explication of empathy as being
based on mechanisms of inner resonance and projection, authors within
the phenomenological tradition of philosophy were persuaded by
Lipps&rsquo;s critique of the inference from analogy. For that very
reason, Husserl and Stein, for example, continued using the concept of
empathy and regarded empathy as an irreducible &ldquo;type of
experiential act sui generis&rdquo; (Stein 1917, 10), which allows us
to view another person as being analogous to ourselves without this
&ldquo;analogizing apprehension&rdquo; constituting an inference of
analogy (Husserl 1931 [1963], 141). Scheler probably went the furthest
in rejecting the Cartesian framework in thinking about the
apprehension of other minds, while remaining committed to something
like the concept of
 empathy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 (In order to contrast his position from Lipps, Scheler preferred to
use the term &ldquo;nachf&uuml;hlen&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;einf&uuml;hlen.&rdquo;) For Scheler, the fundamental mistake of
the debate about the apprehension of other minds consists in the fact
that it does not take seriously certain phenomenological facts. Prima
facie, we do not encounter merely the bodily movements of another
person. Rather, we are directly recognizing specific mental states
because they are characteristically expressed in states of the human
body; in facial expressions, in gestures, in the tone of voice, and so
on. Empathy within the phenomenological tradition then is not
conceived of as a resonance phenomenon requiring the observer to
recreate the mental states of the other person in his or her own mind
but as a special perceptual act (See Scheler 1973, particularly
232&ndash;258; For a succinct explication of the debate about empathy
in the phenomenological tradition consult Zahavi 2010)</p>

<h3 id="MirNeuSimDisEmpConTheMinDeb">3.2 Mirror Neurons, Simulation, and the Discussion of Empathy in the Contemporary Theory of Mind Debate</h3>

<p>
The idea that empathy understood as inner imitation is the primary
epistemic means for understanding other minds has however been revived
in the 1980&rsquo;s by simulation theorists in the context of the
interdisciplinary debate about folk psychology; an empirically
informed debate about how best to describe the underlying causal
mechanisms of our folk psychological abilities to interpret, explain,
and predict other agents. (See Davies and Stone 1995, see Lavelle 2019
for a more recent summary). In contrast to theory theory, simulation
theorists conceive of our ordinary mindreading abilities as an
ego-centric method and as a &ldquo;knowledge&ndash;poor&rdquo;
strategy, where I do not utilize a folk psychological theory but use
myself as a model for the other person&rsquo;s mental life. It is not
the place here to discuss the contemporary debate extensively, but it
has to be emphasized that contemporary simulation theorists vigorously
discuss how to account for our grasp of mental concepts and whether
simulation theory is committed to Cartesianism. Whereas Goldman (2002,
2006) links his version of simulation theory to a neo-Cartesian
account of mental concepts, other simulation theorists develop
versions of simulation theory that are not committed to a Cartesian
conception of the mind. (Gordon 1995a, b, and 2000; Heal 2003; and
Stueber 2012a).</p>

<p>
Moreover, neuroscientific findings according to which so-called mirror
neurons play an important role in recognizing another person&rsquo;s
emotional states and in understanding the goal-directedness of his
behavior have been understood as providing empirical evidence for
Lipps&rsquo; idea of empathy as inner imitation. With the help of the
term &ldquo;mirror neuron,&rdquo; scientists refer to the fact that
there is significant overlap between neural areas of excitation that
underlie our observation of another person&rsquo;s action and areas
that are stimulated when we execute the very same action. A similar
overlap between neural areas of excitation has also been established
for our recognition of another person&rsquo;s emotion based on his
facial expression and our experiencing the emotion. (For a survey on
mirror neurons, see Gallese 2003a and b, Goldman 2006, chap. 6;
Keysers 2011; Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; and particularly
Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2008). Since the face-to-face encounter
between persons is the primary situation within which human beings
recognize themselves as minded creatures and attribute mental states
to others, the system of mirror neurons has been interpreted as
playing a causally central role in establishing intersubjective
relations between minded creatures. For that very reason, the
neuroscientist Gallese thinks of mirror neurons as constituting what
he calls the &ldquo;shared manifold of intersubjectivity&rdquo;
(Gallese 2001, 44). Stueber (2006, chap. 4)&mdash;inspired by
Lipps&rsquo;s conception of empathy as inner imitation&mdash;refers to
mirror neurons as mechanisms of basic
 empathy;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 as mechanisms that allow us to apprehend directly another
person&rsquo;s emotions in light of his facial expressions and that
enable us to understand his bodily movements as goal-directed actions,
that is, as being directed towards an external object like a person
reaching for the cup (Goldman 2011 speaks in this context about
mirroring empathy). The evidence from mirror neurons&mdash;and the
fact that in perceiving other people we use very different
neurobiological mechanisms than in the perception of physical
objects&mdash;does suggest that in our primary perceptual encounter
with the world, we do not merely encounter physical objects. Rather,
even on this basic level, we distinguish already between mere physical
objects and objects that are more like us (See also Meltzoff and
Brooks 2001). The mechanisms of basic empathy have to be seen as
Nature&rsquo;s way of dissolving one of the principal assumptions of
the traditional philosophical discussion about other minds shared by
opposing positions such as Cartesianism and Behaviorism; that is, that
we perceive other people primarily as physical objects and do not
distinguish already on the perceptual level between physical objects
like trees and minded creatures like ourselves. Mechanisms of basic
empathy might therefore be interpreted as providing us with a
perceptual and non-conceptual basis for developing an
intersubjectively accessible folk psychological framework that applies
to the subject and observed other (Stueber 2006, 142&ndash;45).</p>

<p>
It needs to be acknowledged that this interpretation of mirror neurons
crucially depends on the assumption that the primary function of
mirror neurons consists in providing us with a cognitive grasp of
another person&rsquo;s actions and emotions. This interpretation has
been criticized by researchers and philosophers who think that neural
resonance presupposes rather than provides us with an understanding of
what is going on in the minds of others (Csibra 2007, Hickok 2008, and
2014). They have also pointed out that in observing another
person&rsquo;s emotion or behavior, we never fully
&ldquo;mirror&rdquo; another person&rsquo;s neural stimulation. The
neuroscientist Jean Decety has argued that in observing another
person&rsquo;s pain, our vicariously stimulated pain matrix is not
sensitive to the phenomenal quality of pain. Rather, it is sensitive
to pain as an indicator of &ldquo;aversion and withdrawal when exposed
to danger and threats&rdquo;(Decety and Cowell 2015, 6 and Decety
2010). At least as far as empathy for pain is concerned, our neural
resonance is also modulated by a variety of contextual factors, such
as how close we feel to the observed subject, whether we regard the
pain to be morally justified (as in the case of punishment, for
example) or whether we regard it as unavoidable and necessary, such as
in a medical procedure (Singer and Lamm 2009; but see also Allen 2010,
Borg 2007, Debes 2010, Gallese 2016, Goldman 2009, Iacoboni 2011,
Jacob 2008, Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2016).</p>

<p>
Yet it should be noted that everyday mindreading is not restricted to
the realm of basic empathy. Ordinarily, we not only recognize that
other persons are afraid or that they are reaching for a particular
object. We understand their behavior in more complex social contexts
in terms of their reasons for acting using the full range of
psychological concepts, including the concepts of belief and desire.
Evidence from neuroscience shows that these mentalizing tasks involve
very different neuronal areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex,
the temporoparietal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. (For a survey,
see Kain and Perner 2003; Frith and Frith 2003; Zaki and Ochsner
2012). Low-level mindreading in the realm of basic empathy has
therefore to be distinguished from higher levels of mindreading
(Goldman 2006). It is clear that low-level forms of understanding
other persons have to be conceived of as being relatively
knowledge-poor, as they do not involve a psychological theory or
complex psychological concepts. How exactly one should conceive of
high level mindreading abilities, whether they involve primarily
knowledge&ndash;poor simulation strategies or knowledge&ndash;rich
inferences is controversially debated within the contemporary debate
about our folk psychological mindreading abilities(See Davies and
Stone 1995, Gopnik and Meltzoff 1997, Gordon 1995, Currie and
Ravenscroft 2002, Heal 2003, Nichols and Stich 2003, and Goldman
2006). Simulation theorists, however, insist that even more complex
forms of understanding other agents involve resonance phenomena that
engage our cognitively intricate capacities of imaginatively adopting
the perspective of another person and reenacting or recreating their
thought processes and their reasons for acting (For various forms of
perspective-taking, see Coplan 2011 and Goldie 2000). Accordingly,
simulation theorists distinguish between different types of empathy,
such as between basic and reenactive empathy (Stueber 2006) or between
mirroring and reconstructive empathy (Goldman 2011). Interestingly,
the debate about how to conceive of these more complex forms of
mindreading resonates with the traditional debate about whether
empathy is the unique method of the human sciences and whether or not
one has to strictly distinguish between the methods of the human and
the natural sciences. Equally noteworthy is the fact that in the
contemporary theory of mind debate, voices have grown louder that
assert that the contemporary theory of mind debate fundamentally
misconceives the nature of social cognition. In light of insights from
the phenomenological and hermeneutic traditions in philosophy, they
claim that on the most basic level, empathy should not be conceived of
as a resonance phenomenon but as a type of direct perception. (See
particularly Zahavi 2010; Zahavi and Overgaard 2012, but Jacob 2011
for a response). More complex forms of social cognition are also not
to be understood as being based on either theory or
empathy/simulation, rather they are better best conceived of as the
ability to directly fit observed units of actions into larger
narrative or cultural frameworks (For this debate see Gallagher 2012,
Gallagher and Hutto 2008, Hutto 2008, Seemann 2011, Stueber 2011, and
various articles in Matravers and Waldow 2018. For a pluralistic
conception of mindreading see also Fiebich et. 2017 and Spaulding
2017). Regardless of how one views this specific debate, it should be
clear that ideas about mindreading developed originally by proponents
of empathy at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century can no
longer be easily dismissed and have to be taken seriously.</p>

<h3 id="EmpUniMetHumSci">3.3 Empathy as the Unique Method of the Human Sciences</h3>

<p>
At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, empathy understood as
a non-inferential and non-theoretical method of grasping the content
of other minds became closely associated with the concept of
understanding (Verstehen); a concept that was championed by the
hermeneutic tradition of philosophy concerned with explicating the
methods used in grasping the meaning and significance of texts, works
of arts, and actions (For a survey of this tradition, see Grondin
1994). Notice, however, that in contrast to the contemporary debate
about folk psychology, the debate about empathy in the philosophy of
social science is not concerned with investigating underlying causal
mechanisms. Rather, it addresses normative questions of how to justify
a particular explanation or interpretation. For those reasons,
hermeneutic thinkers insisted that the method used in understanding
the significance of a text or a historical event has to be
fundamentally distinguished from the method used in explaining an
event within the context of the natural sciences. This methodological
dualism is famously expressed by Droysen in saying that
&ldquo;historical research does not want to explain; that is, derive
in a form of an inferential argument, rather it wants to
understand&rdquo; (Droysen 1977, 403), and similarly in
Dilthey&rsquo;s dictum that &ldquo;we explain nature, but understand
the life of the soul&rdquo; (Dilthey 1961, vol. 5, 144). To be fair to
Droysen and other nineteenth-century hermeneutic authors, such as
Schleiermacher (1998), it has to be acknowledged that they never
conceived of understanding as being solely based on an act of
imaginatively &ldquo;transporting&rdquo; oneself in the perspective of
another. These &ldquo;psychological interpretations&rdquo; were always
to be accompanied by other interpretive methods to ascertain the
reliability of historical sources or investigate the linguistic norms
of a particular time (for a more recent evaluation of these claims,
see the various articles in Feest 2012). Nevertheless, the close
association of the concepts of empathy and understanding and the
associated claim that empathy is the sole and unique method of the
human sciences also facilitated the decline of the empathy concept and
its almost utter disregard by philosophers of the human and social
sciences later on, in both the analytic and continental/hermeneutic
traditions of philosophy. As a result, most philosophers of the human
and social sciences maintained their distance from the idea that
empathy is central for our understanding of other minds and mental
phenomena. Notable exceptions in this respect are R.G. Collingwood and
his followers, who suggested that reenacting another person&rsquo;s
thoughts is necessary for understanding them as rational agents
(Collingwood 1946, Dray 1957 and 1995).</p>

<p>
Philosophers arguing for a hermeneutic conception of the human and
social sciences still insist on a strict methodological division
between the human and the natural
 sciences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Yet they nowadays favor the concept of understanding (Verstehen) and
reject the earlier identification of understanding and empathy for two
specific reasons. First, empathy is no longer seen as the unique
method of the human sciences because facts of significance, which a
historian or an interpreter of literary and non-literary texts is
interested in, do not solely depend on facts within the individual
mind. A historian, for example, is not bound by the agent&rsquo;s
perspective in telling the story of a particular historical period
(Danto 1965). Similarly, philosophers such as Hans Georg Gadamer have
argued that the significance of a text is not tied to the
author&rsquo;s intentions in writing the text. In reading a text by
Shakespeare or Plato, we are not primarily interested in finding out
what Plato or Shakespeare said, but what these texts themselves say.
(Gadamer 1989; for a critical discussion, see Skinner (in Tully 1988);
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; in K&ouml;gler and Stueber 2000).</p>

<p>
The above considerations, however, do not justify the claim that
empathy has no role to play within the context of the human sciences.
It justifies merely the claim that empathy cannot be their only
method, at least as long as one admits that recognizing the thoughts
of individual agents has to play some role in the interpretive project
of the human sciences. Yet hermeneutic thinkers also assert that
conceiving of empathy as the sole method for understanding individual
agents is epistemically naive. Individual agents are always socially
and culturally embedded creatures. Understanding other agents thus
presupposes an understanding of the cultural context within which an
agent functions. If this cultural background is very different,
interpreters can not very easily put themselves in the shoes of the
other person. If understanding medieval knights, to use an example of
Winch (1958), requires us to think exactly as the medieval knight did,
then it is not clear how such a task can be accomplished from an
interpretive perspective constituted by very different cultural
presuppositions. Making sense of other minds has, therefore, to be
seen as an activity that is a culturally mediated one; a fact that
empathy theorists according to this line of critique do not
sufficiently take into account when they conceive of understanding
other agents as a direct meeting of minds that is independent of and
unaided by information about how these agents are embedded in a
broader social environment. Yet rather than showing that empathy and
imaginative perspective-taking are not at all involved in
understanding other people, these considerations seem to emphasize the
need for additional information and point to some difficulties and
possible limitations of our ability to empathize with others. Some of
them will be discussed in the next subsection. (See also Stueber 2006,
ch. 6, Zahavi 2001, 2005; for the later Dilthey see Makreel 2000. For
a critical discussion of whether the concept of understanding without
recourse to empathy is useful for marking an epistemic distinction
between the human and natural sciences, consult also Stueber 2012b.
Within the context of anthropology, Hollan and Throop argue that
empathy is best understood as a dynamic, culturally situated,
temporally extended, and dialogical process actively involving not
only the interpreter but also his or her interpretee. See Hollan
20012; Hollan and Throop 2008, 2001; Throop 2010).</p>

<p>
Philosophers who reject the methodological dualism between the human
and the natural sciences, commonly referred to as naturalists in the
philosophy of social science, have an additional reason for rejecting
empathy as a serious epistemic method of knowledge acquisition. For
them, even the human or social sciences are in the business of
providing epistemically justified explanations (and predictions) of
observed or recorded events (see also Henderson 1993). As particularly
Hempel (1965) has argued, to explain an event involves&mdash;at least
implicitly&mdash;an appeal to law-like regularities providing us with
reasons for expecting that an event of a certain kind will occur under
specific circumstances. At most, empathy is granted a heuristic role
in the context of discovery. It can not play any role within the
context of justification. Empathy might allow me to recognize that I
would have acted in the same manner as somebody else. Yet it does not
epistemically sanction the claim that anybody of a particular type or
anybody who is in that type of situation will act in this manner.</p>

<p>
Hempel&rsquo;s argument against empathy has certainly not gone
unchallenged. Within the philosophy of history, Dray (1957), following
Collingwood, has argued that empathy plays an epistemically
irreducible role, since we explain actions in terms of an
agent&rsquo;s reasons. For him, such reason explanations do not appeal
to empirical generalizations but to normative principles of actions
outlining how a person should act in a particular situation. Similar
arguments have been articulated by Jaegwon Kim (1984, 1998). Yet as
Stueber (2006, chap. 5) argues, such a response to Hempel would
require us to implausibly conceive of reason explanations as being
very different from ordinary causal explanations. Moreover, as Hempel
himself suggests, appealing to normative principles explains at most
why a person should have acted in a certain manner. It does not
explain why he ultimately acted in that way. (For Kim&rsquo;s recent
attempt to account for the explanatory character of action
explanations by acknowledging the centrality of the first-person
perspective, see also Kim 2010). Despite these concessions to Hempel,
Stueber suggests that empathy (specifically reenactive empathy) has to
be acknowledged as playing a central role even in the context of
justification. For him, folk psychological explanations have to be
understood as being tied to the domain of rational agency. In contrast
to explanations in terms of mere inner causes, folk psychological
explanations retain their explanatory force only as long as
agents&rsquo; beliefs and desires can also be understood as reasons
for their actions. The epistemic justification of such folk
psychological explanations implicitly relies on generalizations
involving folk psychological notions such as belief and desire. Yet
the existence of such generalizations alone does not establish
specific beliefs and desires as reasons for a person&rsquo;s actions.
Elaborating on considerations by Heal (2003) and Collingwood (1946),
Stueber suggests that recognizing beliefs and desires as reasons
requires the interpreter to be sensitive to an agent&rsquo;s other
relevant beliefs and desires. Individual thoughts function as reasons
for rational agency only relative to a specific framework of an
agent&rsquo;s thoughts that are relevant for consideration in a
specific situation. Most plausibly&mdash;given our persistent
inability to solve the frame problem&mdash;recognizing which of
another agent&rsquo;s thoughts are relevant in specific contexts
requires the practical ability of reenacting another person&rsquo;s
thoughts in one&rsquo;s own mind. Empathy&rsquo;s central epistemic
role has to be admitted, since beliefs and desires can be understood
only in this manner as an agent&rsquo;s reasons (See Stueber 2008. For
a related discussion about the role of understanding in contemporary
epistemology and philosophy of science, see Grimm 2016 and Grimm,
Baumberger, and Ammon 2017).</p>

<h3 id="StrLimEmpHowMakSenAnoPerPerExp">3.4 The Structural Limits of Empathy or How to Make Sense of Another Person&rsquo;s Perspective and Experiences?</h3>

<p>
The debate about the epistemic scope of our empathic capacities has
been revived within the contemporary interdisciplinary context
involving mainly the psychological sciences, philosophy, and at times,
political science. To a large extent, this debate has been driven by
empirical research investigating the biases that tend to limit the
scope of our empathic engagement with others due to a variety of
social power differentials, perceptions of similarities between the
interpreter and interpretee, and differences in class, race, gender,
or ethnicity. Without doubt, these debates are of utmost importance,
and so is the debate about how to mitigate the influence of such
biases. We will discuss them in the next section when we analyze
certain arguments for the morally dark sides of empathy. In some
sense, one could also regard such biases to be impacting our
motivation to use our empathic imagination to understand others rather
than being features that have to do with the structure or nature of
empathic perspective-taking (See Spaulding 2024). Moreover, the social
biases commonly mentioned do not merely influence empathy, but, more
generally, influence and distort all our attitudes and emotional
engagement with others. We tend to be more angry and less forgiving,
for example, with transgressions of rules committed by people who are
perceived to be socially marginalized or part of the social outgroup.
In this section, we will, therefore, be discussing epistemic
limitations that can be understood as arising from the fact that
empathy, at least in its more cognitive advanced form that involves
perspective-taking, is the attempt to understand the subjectivity of
another person&rsquo;s perspective with the help of our own
idiosyncratic experiences and subjective perspective on the world.
Even though each of us has our social biases and tends not to perceive
all humans as being on equal footing, we can all be distinguished in
light of our unique life experiences. We might also belong to very
different cultural and social groups and differ greatly in our value
commitments and what we regard as important to really care about. Do
such differences ultimately not limit and affect the ability to
imaginatively adopt the perspective of a person from a very different
social and cultural background? Can we be epistemically confident, for
instance, that a person from a scientific culture can fully adopt the
perspective of a person from a more traditional religious and
ritualistic culture, a topic that has been intensely debated in the
so-called rationality wars in anthropology in the 1970s?</p>

<p>
The investigation into the epistemic limitations of empathy also
gained new urgency in light of the scientific and philosophical
interest in phenomenal consciousness during the last few decades. As
it is well known, Nagel (1974) claims that humans can&rsquo;t imagine
what it is like to be a bat because humans lack the physical machinery
to realize a bat&rsquo;s experiences. Even more pertinent to the
discussion of empathy&rsquo;s epistemic scope is Jackson&rsquo;s
thought experiment about Mary the neuroscientist, who lacks knowledge
about what it feels like to see something red, because she grew up in
a black and white room (Jackson 1982). Mary thus seems to be unable to
empathize with another person&rsquo;s experience of seeing something
red that would provide her with knowledge or phenomenal understanding
of the other person&rsquo;s mind from the inside, supposedly a central
epistemic function of empathy (Goldie 2000, Heal 2003, Smith 2017).
Phenomenal states, at least if you look at them in isolation, appear
to differ in this respect from merely propositional or cognitive
states. Taking on a pretend belief in the imagination (such as
believing that the earth is flat) is a rather easy feat to accomplish,
even if we never believed it before. Boisserie-Lacroix and Inchingolo
(2021) distinguish for that very reason between agential empathy,
reenacting another person&rsquo;s propositional states, from
experiential empathy, allowing us to gain access to the phenomenal
side of another person&rsquo;s inner life. Given our intuition about
Mary, imagining another person&rsquo;s experience would have to depend
on our own prior experiences. Only if we have had specific experiences
do we seem able to imagine and empathize with what it feels like for
another person to see something red, to taste something sweet, to feel
sad, to be afraid, or even to fall in love. Yet what if this is not
the case? If we are blind or deaf, or if we have grown up in a black
and white world like Mary, then our empathic recreation of what
another person experiences will fall short of adequately representing
what the other person feels. At most, we could know in a propositional
manner that she feels afraid, but might not know what that means on a
phenomenal level if we never felt afraid. Luckily, we have all been
afraid at times. Yet it seems that we never should be able to fully
understand what it feels like to be a parent or to be a soldier at war
if we never were parents or soldiers at war. Laurie Paul (2014 &amp;
2020) has taken such skepticism to its extreme in recent times by
arguing that we could never rationally decide whether we should become
parents as we are as non-parents cognitively closed to such
experiences (see also Clavel Vazquez and Clavel Vazquez 2023 for a
more moderate form of such skepticism based on the insight that all
our experiences are essentially embodied ones that are shaped by our
individual social and cultural environments).</p>

<p>
One can certainly doubt whether empathy with affective phenomenal
states can be strictly distinguished from empathy with other
attitudes. To use an example from Betzler and Keller (2021) it seems
that I only can vicariously feel your outrage about a particular
person if I also can reenact your belief that that person was rude to
you, and that seems to require that I share at least in the
imagination assumptions about what constitutes normatively appropriate
ways of behaving (For a debate see also the various articles in
Vendrall Ferran and Werner 2025). Regardless of this issue, the
question of whether or not empathy is seriously limited deserves an
answer. For a more optimistic take on this topic, one can find the
following responses in the literature: Most importantly, it needs to
be underlined that empathic understanding should never be conceived of
as trying to become the other person (See also Maibom 2022). In taking
the perspective of another person we are always aware of the fact that
we have to adjust our perspective (imaginatively taking on mental
states and attitudes that we do not share with the other person and
quarantining those attitudes that the other person does not share with
us) to approximate the other&rsquo;s perspective in our own mind (in
some sense being always aware of the fact that there are difference
between us). These considerations also imply that it is impossible to
feel the same way as the person whose feelings I empathically reenact.
In vicariously feeling your anger, it is not me who is angry, nor have
I become the angry you. Becoming the other through empathic
perspective-taking is indeed a conceptual impossibility (Goldie 2011).
If that is so, one can also not conceive of becoming the other as a
standard according to which we evaluate the epistemic character of
empathic understanding. Empathic understanding thus remains bound to
the interpreter&rsquo;s perspective and is always perspectival. A
religious person with a Christian background might indeed relate
differently to an agent from a Buddhist tradition than a more secular
person. This, however, does not mean that we have no way of evaluating
the quality of such understanding against each other, since we can
also understand each other&rsquo;s interpretive suggestions and
discuss them critically. In regard to interpretations of living
agents, those agents also have the option to object to any
interpretive renderings of their actions and perspective from the
point of view of another. It has, however, to be admitted that the
more the other persons differ in their core commitments, attitudes,
and what they care about, the more likely it is that we encounter
stronger degrees of imaginative resistance. At times, we might even be
forced to admit that we can no longer pretend to understand them from
the inside and have to fall back on a more theoretical and detached
way of explaining their action. Think in this context about the action
of school shooters. Being told about any motives they have (based on
some confused manifesto they might leave behind) never fully allows us
to empathically grasp how their motives can be their reasons for
committing these atrocities. All we can point to is that people do act
that way at times if they are socially isolated or depressed. Similar
considerations have arisen in contemporary research on extremism,
particularly violent extremism, where we seem to be compelled to
acknowledge the subjectivity of the extremist action while we, at the
same time, have great difficulty in empathizing with their
perspective. Empathy here seems to lead only to a form of schematic or
fragmentary understanding (See in this respect Cassam 2018 &amp;
forthcoming, and Stueber forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Authors mainly concerned with addressing the question of whether
empathy can provide us with knowledge of what it feels like tend to
emphasize that we should conceive of empathy as providing us with
different degrees of understanding depending on the kind of
experiences the empathizer has had and the degree of similarity
between the empathizer and the person empathized with. (See Cath 2019,
Werner 2023, and Wiltscher 2021). Researchers also point to the role
of testimony as providing us with a more direct access to a
person&rsquo;s experiences. (Cath also speaks of a silver standard
regarding knowledge of experience in this respect). That is one of the
reasons why we try to make sure that we videotape as many of the
testimonies of holocaust survivors as possible so that we preserve
some access to what it must have felt like for them while being
imprisoned in a concentration camp (Berninger 2024). Most importantly,
when we discuss phenomenal knowledge in the context of understanding
other persons, we tend not to focus on grasping simple qualia that are
the focus of philosophers worried about the metaphysical framework of
physicalism. We focus on more complex experiences that happen over an
extended period. We want to know what it is like to be a parent, or a
soldier at war, or how the &ldquo;goalie&rsquo;s anxiety at the
penalty kick&rdquo; feels and develops, the topic of one of Peter
Handke&rsquo;s famous novels. To grasp such experiences from the
inside does indeed require effort; it requires listening to testimony,
and it requires skillfully using one&rsquo;s imagination through a
process of &ldquo;empathic scaffolding&rdquo; (Werner 2025, Vendrall
Ferran 2025, but also see Kind 2020), adding and subtracting from our
repertoire of simpler and complex experiences to approximate the lived
experience of the other person. Literature and film might also further
help us to improve our imaginative skills (Keen 2007, and a variety of
articles in Petraschka and Werner 2024). Of course, these reflections
have political implications, since they are centrally relevant for the
intense debate about who can and should speak for the marginalized and
disadvantaged members of society, given that only the marginalized
experience certain injustices firsthand. Similarly, they concern the
question of what role empathy has, can, and should play for democratic
institutions, democratic deliberation, and whether it can help us to
overcome political polarization. Even in these contexts, it tends to
be stressed that empathic understanding comes in degrees, and that it
requires effort and institutional support in order to be effective. On
the other hand, overemphasizing the impossibility of empathic
understanding might have detrimental consequences since it suggests
that it is impossible to find widespread agreement on the reasons for
ameliorating morally unjustifiable aspects of society, undermining in
this manner the possibility of solidarity between class, gender, and
race boundaries. Indeed, without empathy and institutional support for
it, it can be hard to see how deliberation within a democratic society
mediating between different perspectives can function. (In this
respect, see particularly Hannon 2020 &amp; 2025, Hartmann 2023,
Krause 2008 &amp; 2011, Meyers 2017, Mackenzie and Sorial 2021,
Morrell 2010, and Read 2021 &amp; 2022).</p>

<h2 id="EmpMorPhiMorPsy">4. Empathy, Moral Philosophy, and Moral Psychology</h2>

<p>
Moral philosophers have been less concerned with the epistemic
accuracy of gaining knowledge of other minds. They are primarily
concerned with articulating and justifying standards according to
which we hold each other accountable. Within this context, moral
psychology has always played a central role, since one needs to get a
clear sense of an agent&rsquo;s motivational structure in order to
explicate the importance of morality for a human life. After all,
moral judgments supposedly make demands on an agent&rsquo;s will and
are supposed to provide us with reasons and motivations for acting in
a certain manner. Yet moral judgments, at least in the manner in which
we conceive of them in modern times, are also regarded as being based
on normative standards that, in contrast to mere conventional norms,
have universal scope and are valid independent of the features of
specific social practices that agents are embedded in. One only needs
to think of statements such as &ldquo;cruelty to innocent children or
slavery is morally wrong,&rdquo; which we view as applying also to
social practices where the attitude of its population seems to condone
such actions. Moral judgements thus address us from the perspective of
the moral stance where we leave behind the perspective of self-love
and do not conceive of each other either as friends or foes (see Hume
1987, 75) or as belonging to the in&ndash;group or out&ndash;group,
but where we view each other all to be equal part of a moral
community. Finally, and relatedly, in order to view morality as
something that is possible for human beings, we also require that our
motivations based on or associated with moral reasons have a selfless
character. Given to charity for merely selfish reasons, for example,
seems to clearly diminish its moral worth and implicitly deny the
universal character of a moral demand. Philosophically explicating the
importance of morality for human life then has to do the following: It
has to explain how it is that we humans do care about morality thusly
conceived, it has to address the philosophically even more pertinent
question of why it is that we should care about morality or why it is
that we should regard judgments issued from the perspective of the
moral stance to have normative authority over us; and it has to allow
us to understand how it is that we can act self-lessly in a manner
that correspond to the demands made on us from the moral stance.
Answering all of these questions, however, necessitates at one point
explaining how our moral interests are related to our psychological
constitution as human beings and how moral demands can be understood
as being appropriately addressed to agents who are psychologically
structured in that manner.</p>

<p>
Prima facie, the difficulty of this enterprise consists in squaring a
realistic account of human psychology with the universal scope and
intersubjective validity of moral judgments, since human motivation
and psychological mechanisms seem to be always situational, local, and
of rather limited scope. Moreover, as evolutionary psychologists tell
us in&ndash;group bias seems to be a universal trait of human
psychology. One of the most promising attempts to solve this problem
is certainly due to the tradition of eighteenth century moral
philosophy associated with the names of David Hume and Adam Smith who
tried to address all of the above philosophical desiderata by pointing
to the central role that our empathic and sympathetic capacities have
for constituting us as social and moral agents and for providing us
with the psychological capacities to make and to respond to moral
judgments. While philosophers in the Kantian tradition, who favor
reason over sentiments, have generally been skeptical about this
proposal, more recently, the claim that empathy is central for
morality and a flourishing human life has again been the topic of an
intense and controversial debate. On the one hand, empathy has been
hailed by researchers from a wide range of disciplines and also by
some public figures, President Obama most prominently among them.
Slote (2010) champions empathy as the sole foundation of moral
judgment, de Waal (2006) conceives of it as the unique evolutionary
building block of morality, Rifkin (2009) regards it even as a force
whose cultivation has unique revolutionary powers to transform a world
in crisis, and Baron-Cohen (2011, 194) views it as a &ldquo;universal
solvent&rdquo; in that &ldquo;any problem immersed in empathy becomes
soluble.&rdquo; On the other hand, such empathy enthusiasm has
encountered penetrating criticism by Prinz (2011a,b) and Bloom (2016),
who emphasize its dark side, that is, its tendency to fall prey to
so&ndash;called &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; biases. The following
subsections will address these issues by surveying the relevant
empirical research on the question of whether empathy motivates us
selflessly, the question of whether empathy is inherently biased and
partial to the in-group, and it will discuss how we might think of the
normative character of moral judgments in light of our empathic
capacities. (For a survey of other relevant issues from social
psychology, specifically social neuroscience, consult also Decety and
Lamm 2006; Decety and Ickes 2009, and Decety 20012. For a discussion
of the importance of empathy for medical practice, see Halpern
2001)</p>

<h3 id="EmpAltMot">4.1 Empathy and Altruistic Motivation</h3>

<p>
In a series of ingeniously designed experiments, Batson has
accumulated evidence for what he calls the empathy-altruism thesis. In
arguing for this thesis, Batson conceives of empathy as empathic
concern or what others would call sympathy. More specifically, he
characterized it in terms of feelings of being sympathetic, moved by,
being compassionate, tender, warm and soft-hearted towards the
other&rsquo;s plight (Batson et al. 1987, 26) The task of his
experiments consists in showing that empathy/sympathy does indeed lead
to genuinely altruistic motivation, where the welfare of the other is
the ultimate goal of my helping behavior, rather than to helping
behavior because of predominantly egoistic motivations. According to
the egoistic interpretation of empathy&ndash;related phenomena,
empathizing with another person in need is associated with a negative
feeling or can lead to a heightened awareness of the negative
consequences of not helping, such as feelings of guilt, shame, or
social sanctions. Alternatively, it can lead to an enhanced
recognition of the positive consequences of helping behavior, such as
social rewards or good feelings. Empathy, according to this
interpretation, induces us to help through the mediation of purely
egoistic motivations. We help others only because we recognize helping
behavior as a means to egoistic ends. It allows us to reduce our
negative feelings (aversive arousal reduction hypothesis), to avoid
&ldquo;punishment,&rdquo; or to gain specific internal or external
&ldquo;rewards&rdquo; (empathy-specific punishment and
empathy-specific reward hypotheses).</p>

<p>
Notice that in arguing for the empathy-altruism thesis, Batson is not
claiming that empathy always induces helping behavior. Rather, he
argues against the predominance of an egoistic interpretation of an
agent&rsquo;s motivational structure. He argues for the existence of
genuinely altruistic motivations and, more specifically, for the claim
that empathy causes such genuinely altruistic motivation. These
genuinely altruistic motives (together with other egoistic motives)
are taken into account by the individual agent in deliberating about
whether or not to help. Even for Batson, the question of whether the
agent will act on his or her altruistic motivations depends ultimately
on how strong they are and what costs the agent would incur in helping
another person.</p>

<p>
In his experiments, Batson proceeds by manipulating the situation of
the experimental subjects (dependent on the egoistic alternative to be
argued against) and empathy/sympathy felt for an observed target in
need. The decisive evidence for the empathy/sympathy-altruism thesis
is always the recorded behavior of the subject, who is in a high
empathy condition and in a situation where his helping behavior can
not plausibly be seen as a means for the satisfaction of a personal
goal. Since here is not the place to extensively describe the details
of Batson&rsquo;s experiments, a brief description of the experimental
setup&mdash;focusing on Batson&rsquo;s argument against the aversive
arousal interpretation of empathy&mdash;and a brief evaluation of the
success of his general argumentative strategy has to suffice (for more
details see Batson 1991 and 2011). In all of his experiments, Batson
assumes&mdash;based on Stotland (1969) and others&mdash;that
empathy/sympathy can be manipulated either by manipulating the
perceived similarity between subjects and targets or by manipulating
the perspective-taking attitude of the subjects. Empathy can be
increased by enhancing the perceived similarity between subject and
target or by asking the subject to imagine how the observed person
would feel in his or her situation rather than asking the subject to
attend carefully to the information provided. [Note also that
instructing the subject to imagine how they themselves would feel in
the other&rsquo;s situation, rather than instructing them to imagine
how the other feels, is associated with an increase in personal
distress and not only sympathetic feelings. (Batson et al. 1997b and
Lamm, Batson, and Decety 2007).]</p>

<p>
In trying to argue against the aversive arousal reduction
interpretation, Batson also manipulates the ease with which a subject
can avoid helping another person (in this case, taking his place when
they see him getting electric shocks). He reasons that if empathy
leads to genuinely altruistic motivations, subjects in the high
empathy/easy escape condition should still be willing to help. If they
were only helping in order to reduce their own negative feelings, they
would be expected to leave in this situation, since leaving is the
less costly means for reaching an egoistic goal. As Batson was happy
to report, the results confirmed his empathy/sympathy-altruism
hypothesis, not only in the above experiments but also in experiments
testing other alternative interpretations of empathy, such as the
empathy-specific punishment and the empathy-specific award
hypotheses.</p>

<p>
Researchers generally agree in finding Batson&rsquo;s experimental
research program and the accumulated evidence for the empathy-altruism
thesis to be impressive. Yet they disagree about how persuasive one
should ultimately regard his position. In particular, it has been
pointed out that his experiments have limited value, since they target
only very specific egoistic accounts of why empathy might lead to
helping behavior. Batson is not able to dismiss conclusively every
alternative egoistic interpretation. In addition, it has been claimed
that egoism has the resources to account for the results of his
experiments. For example, one might challenge the validity of
Batson&rsquo;s interpretation by speculating whether empathy/sympathy
leads to a heightened awareness of the fact that one will be troubled
by bad memories of seeing another person in need if one does nothing
to help him or her. In this case, even an egoistically motivated
person would help in the high empathy/easy escape condition. (For this
reply and various other egoistic interpretations of Batson&rsquo;s
experiment,s see Sober and Wilson 1998, 264&ndash;271).</p>

<p>
Cialdini and his collaborators have suggested an even more elaborate
non-altruistic interpretation of helping behavior in high empathy/easy
escape conditions. According to their suggestions, conditions of high
empathy are also conditions of increased &ldquo;interpersonal unity,
wherein the conception of self and other are not distinct but are
merged to some degree&rdquo; (Cialdini et al. 1997, 490). It is this
increased feeling of oneness rather than empathy that is causally
responsible for motivating helping behavior (See Batson et al. 1997a,
Neuberg et al. 1997, and Batson 1997 and 2011 for a plausible reply
and May 2018, 144&ndash;153 for a probing discussion of the relation
between empathic concern and oneness). One, therefore, has to be
cautious in claiming that Batson has conclusively proven that the
empathy/sympathy-altruism hypothesis is true, if that means one has
logically excluded every egoistic alternative in accounting for
helping behavior. But it has to be acknowledged that Batson has
radically changed the argumentative dialectic of the egoism-altruism
debate by forcing the egoistic account of human agency to come up with
ever more elaborate alternative interpretations in order to account
for helping behavior within its framework. Egoism was supposed to
provide a rather unified and relatively simple account of the
motivational structure of human agency. In challenging the
predominance and simplicity of this framework in an empirically acute
fashion, Batson has at least established altruism&mdash;claiming that
besides egoistic motivations, we are also motivated by genuinely
altruistic reasons&mdash;as an empirically plausible hypothesis. He
has shown it to be a hypothesis that one is almost persuaded to
believe is true, as he recently has characterized his own epistemic
attitude (Batson 1997, 522). More positively expressed, Batson&rsquo;s
research has at least demonstrated that empathy/sympathy is a causal
factor in bringing about helping behavior. Regardless of the question
of the exact nature of the underlying motivation for helping or
prosocial behavior, psychologists generally assume that in adults and
children a positive, even if weak, correlation between
empathy&mdash;measured in a variety of ways&mdash;and prosocial
behavior has been established; and this even though the above aspects
of emotional responding to another person have not always been
sufficiently distinguished.(For a survey see Eisenberg and Miller
1987; Eisenberg/Fabes 1998, Spinrad and Eisenberg 2014. For a general
survey of the various factors contributing to prosocial behavior see
Bierhoff 2002).</p>

<p>
Regardless of how exactly one views the strength of Batson&rsquo;s
position, his research alone does not validate the thesis articulated
by various traditional moral philosophers, that sympathy or empathy is
the basis of morality or that it constitutes the only source for moral
motivation. First, nothing in his research has shown that
empathy/sympathy is empirically necessary for moral agency. Second,
some of Batson&rsquo;s own research casts doubt on the claim that
sympathy/empathy is the foundation of morality, since empathy-induced
altruism can lead to behavior that conflicts with our principles of
justice and fairness. One, for example, tends to assign a better job
or a higher priority for receiving medical treatment to persons with
whom one has sympathized, in violation of the above moral principles
(See Batson et al. 1995). For that very reason, Batson himself
distinguishes between altruistic motivation concerned with the
well-being of another person and moral motivation guided by principles
of justice and fairness (Batson 2011). Unfortunately, we do not always
realize this fact when we abstractly contrast moral motivation broadly
with egoistic motivation. For that very reason, we also do not realize
that we need to be more conscious in &ldquo;orchestrating&rdquo; the
relationship between altruistic and moral motivations in order to
fully utilize the motivational power of altruism for moral purposes
(Batson 2014). Finally, the research discussed so far is not relevant
for deciding the question of whether sophisticated mindreading
abilities are required for full-blown moral agency, since Batson
understands empathy primarily as an emotional phenomenon. (See Nichols
2001 and Batson et al. 2003 in this respect.)</p>

<h3 id="EmpParSusBiaMorAge">4.2 Empathy, Its Partiality, Susceptibility to Bias, and Moral Agency</h3>

<p>
Within the psychological literature, one of the most comprehensive
accounts of empathy and its relation to the moral development of a
person is provided by the work of Martin Hoffman (for a summary, see
his 2000). Hoffman views empathy as a biologically based disposition
for altruistic behavior (Hoffman 1981). He conceives of empathy as
being due to various modes of arousal, allowing us to respond
empathically in light of a variety of distress cues from another
person. Hoffman mentions mimicry, classical conditioning, and direct
association&mdash;where one empathizes because the other&rsquo;s
situation reminds one of one&rsquo;s own painful experience&mdash;as
&ldquo;fast acting and automatic&rdquo; mechanisms producing an
empathic response. As more cognitively demanding modes, Hoffman lists
mediated association&mdash;where the cues for an empathic response are
provided in a linguistic medium&mdash;and role taking.</p>

<p>
Hoffman distinguishes between six (or more) developmental stages of
empathic responses, ranging from the reactive newborn cry, egocentric
empathic distress, quasi-ego-centric empathic distress, to veridical
empathy, empathy for another beyond the immediate situation, and
empathy for whole groups of people. Accordingly, empathic responses
constitute a developmental continuum that ranges from emotional
contagion (as in the case of a reactive newborn cry) to various forms
of proper empathy reached at the fourth stage. At the developmentally
later stages, the child can emotionally respond to the distress of
another in a more sophisticated manner due to an increase in cognitive
capacities, particularly due to the increased cognitive ability to
distinguish between self and other, and by becoming aware of the fact
that others have mental states that are independent from its own. Only
at the fourth stage of empathic development (after the middle of the
second year) do children acquire such abilities. They no longer try to
comfort themselves when emotionally responding to another
child&rsquo;s distress&mdash;like seeking comfort from their own
mother&mdash;or use helping strategies that are more appropriate to
comfort themselves than the other person&mdash;like using their own
teddy bear in trying to comfort the other child. Only at the fourth
stage does empathy become transformed or associated with sympathy,
leading to appropriate prosocial behavior. Hoffman&rsquo;s
developmental view is further supported by Preston and DeWaal&rsquo;s
account of empathy as a phenomenon to be observed across species at
various levels of complexity related to different degrees of cognitive
development. (Preston and DeWaal 2002a,b. For a discussion of the
philosophical relevance of DeWaal&rsquo;s view, see also DeWaal
2006).</p>

<p>
Significantly, Hoffman combines his developmental explication of
empathy with a sophisticated analysis of its importance for moral
agency. He is thereby acutely aware of the limitations in our natural
capacity to empathize or sympathize with others, particularly what he
refers to as &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; biases, that is, the fact that
we tend to empathize more with persons that are in some sense
perceived to be closer to us. (For a neuro-scientific investigation of
how racial bias modulates empathic responses, see Xuo, Zuo, Wang, and
Han 2009). Like Batson, Hoffman does not regard the moral realm as
being exclusively circumscribed by our ability to empathize with other
people. Besides empathic abilities, moral agency requires knowledge of
abstract moral principles, such as the principles of caring and
justice. Hoffman seems to conceive of those principles as being
derived from cognitive sources that are independent of our empathic
abilities. Yet Hoffmann is rather optimistic about the natural
compatibility of empathic motivation and our commitment to moral
principles. He regards stable and effective moral agency as requiring
empathy so that moral principles can have a motivational basis in an
agent&rsquo;s psychology. Within this context, he has lately
emphasized a final stage of empathy development or what he calls
&ldquo;witnessing&rdquo;, an empathic response to the suffering of
others that is so intense that we &ldquo;become fully committed to
help&rdquo;(Hoffman 2014, 82). As he explains&mdash;in light of
examples from the history of abolitionism, the civil rights movement,
serfdom reform in Russia, and various cases before the Supreme
Court&mdash; it is particularly such witnessing that has contributed
towards bending the arc of the moral universe towards justice.
Accordingly, and despite our natural limitations in empathizing with
others, Hoffman still regards empathy as the &ldquo;bedrock of
morality&rdquo; and &ldquo;the glue of society&rdquo;(Hoffman 2014,
96. Besides Hoffman 2011 and 2014, see also Deigh 2011 for a measured
evaluation of empathy in the legal context).</p>

<p>
More recently, such a positive evaluation of empathy&rsquo;s
contributing role in constituting us as moral agents, as agents who
address each other from the moral stance, has encountered penetrating
criticism, particularly by Prinz (2011a,b), Bloom (2016), and
Breithaupt 2019 (For a more moderate formulation of his negative
stance toward empathy see also Bloom 2022). All of them emphasize the
dark side of empathy, that is, the aforementioned &ldquo;here and
now&rdquo; biases. More specifically, Prinz mentions explicitly the
cuteness, salience, and proximity effects&mdash;the fact that we tend
to empathize more easily with attractive persons, with persons that
are in close proximity and only if their suffering is particularly
noteworthy&mdash; similarity biases, and the fact that we tend to be
rather selective in choosing whom to empathize with. Empathy is also
very easily modulated by a variety of top-down factors that influence
our perception of the social world and that let us register social
divisions that seem to be prima facie incompatible with the more
impartial stance demanded by the moral perspective. Research has
documented these biases in a more fine-grained manner and shown that
subjects generally &ldquo;reported experiencing more empathy for the
in&ndash;group then the out&ndash;group targets and more
counter&ndash;empathy for the out&ndash;group than in&ndash;group
targets&rdquo;(Cikara et. al. 2014, 120), counter&ndash;empathy here
being understood as the feeling of pleasure at the misfortune of
another (Schadenfreude) or the feeling displeasure at something
fortunate happening to another (Gl&uuml;ckschmerz). This is
particularly true if the other group is viewed to be in competition
with one&rsquo;s own group. Empathy can also be further reduced
through various dehumanizing and objectifying strategies, strategies
that have certainly been employed in the context of the genocides of
the twentieth century and the system of racial slavery in the United
States (See Fuchs 2019, Kteily and Bruneau 2017). Heightened empathy
for perceived wrongs done to members of the in&ndash;group can also
lead to violent and immoral behavior (Bloom 2016, chap. 5). In
addition, empathy tends to focus on the one (particularly if he or she
is identifiable) rather than the many, what Bloom refers to as its
spotlight feature. Empathy can mislead us particularly in contexts
where we need to take into account statistically relevant information
when addressing a moral or social problem, such as when thinking about
the benefits of vaccination, where it is more appropriate to think
about the large numbers of children saved rather than empathizing with
the bad effects such vaccination might have on one specific child. For
all of these reasons, Prinz favors the moral emotions such as anger,
guilt and shame as the foundation for morality, while Bloom prefers
sympathy guided by reason as a more viable means than empathy to steer
us in moral matters (Breithaupt 2019 has a nuanced evaluation of
empathy: He suggests that we should evaluate empathy less from the
moral stance but think of the positive contribution of empathy in
terms of broadening one&rsquo;s narrow perspective and intensifying
one&rsquo;s asethetic engagement with the world).</p>

<p>
Here is not the place for a final evaluation of empathy&rsquo;s
contribution in regard to pro-social and moral motivation or moral and
pro-social behavior, since this question is still very much the topic
of an ongoing empirical investigation. Yet the following observations
are certainly justified in light of the empirical evidence so far and
might help to clarify the debate further. First, it seems to be pretty
well established that, however one defines our natural capacity for
empathy, it is on its own not sufficient to keep us reliably on the
path of morality (See also Decety and Cowell 2015). Whether that
ultimately means we should consider our capacity for empathy as a
limited resource or whether it would be better to view empathy as a
motivated phenomenon, with its limitations stemming from our
reluctance to activate that capacity (Zaki 2014), is certainly another
intriguing question for further empirical inquiry. One might also
wonder why we should expect that the emotions such as sympathy and
anger, which Bloom and Prinz point to, are less prone to bias and less
affected by a universal human tendency to favor the in&ndash;group.
Certainly, sympathy within the context of Buddhism, to which Bloom
appeals to is a highly regulated emotion, controlled through
mindfulness practices or meditation and guided by an intellectual
grasp about the detriments of various forms of attachment to this
world. Persson and Savulescu (2018) therefore suggest that rather than
giving up on empathy completely one should reform empathy by
regulating it through one&rsquo;s reflective capacities in light of
our knowledge of its natural shortcomings or focus one&rsquo;s empathy
(cognitive and affective) particularly on another person&rsquo;s
concerns for his or her well-being as such empathy includes sympathy
for the other (Simmons 2014). Such suggestions are also very much in
line with proposals by David Hume and Adam Smith, who suggested
already in the eighteenth century that we need to regulate empathy
with the help of certain corrective mechanisms such as &ldquo;some
steady and general points of view&rdquo; or the perspective of
the&ldquo;impartial spectator&rdquo; to compensate for empathy&rsquo;s
limited scope. (For a good analysis of the philosophical discussion
about empathy/sympathy in the eighteenth century, see Frazer
2010).</p>

<p>
Most importantly, in order to evaluate the empirical discussion about
empathy&rsquo;s role for morality, one needs to be very sensitive to
how researchers define and measure empathy. Prinz and Bloom are quite
explicit in defining empathy merely as an affective phenomenon, as our
ability to feel what the other person feels. Evidence suggests indeed
that merely sharing another person&rsquo;s emotion empathically does
not increase our concern or motivation for moral or pro-social action.
Interestingly, however, perspective&ndash;taking and empathic
concern/sympathy, which have always been seen as an integral part of
empathy-related phenomena, are a slightly different matter. They do
seem to be positively related to cooperation and charitable giving
(Jordon et. al. 2016), to reducing prejudices against particular
groups (Galinski and Morowitz 2011), and to an increase in one&rsquo;s
sensitivity to injustices done to others (Decety and Yoder 2015). Yet
even here, further research is needed as the effects of such
perspective&ndash;taking could be modulated by the power differential
between groups. It has, for example, been shown that in active
intergroup conflicts, positive intergroup interaction can increase
empathy for the other group. Yet within such contexts, taking the
perspective of a person from the other group while interacting with
them might also hinder the development of intergroup empathy if the
dominant group is reminded through such perspective&ndash;taking of
how they might be viewed by the non-dominant group. Even perspective
taking by the non&ndash;dominant group might increase rather than
decrease established negative stereotypes in thinking about the other
group (Cikara et. al. 2014). It seems more effective if the
non&ndash;dominant group is asked to articulate the difficulties of
their lives (perspective&ndash;giving) and the dominant group is asked
to translate that description into their own words
(perspective&ndash;taking), even if the positive effects of such
interaction are relatively short-lived (Bruneau and Saxe 2012).
Finally, despite all of its problems, we probably can&rsquo;t imagine
living a human and humane life without empathy. How else would it be
possible to establish deep emotional interpersonal relations that form
the basis of relations between friends, members of a family, and form
the foundation of human solidarity (in this respect, see Bailey 2022,
Betzler 2019, and Song 2015). While it is true that such solidarity
does not automatically have a universal scope, it is unlikely that we
would feel any obligations toward others without practicing it first
in small-scale societies.</p>

<h3 id="EmpMorJudAutMorNor">4.3 Empathy, Moral Judgment, and the Authority of Moral Norms</h3>

<p>
So far, this entry has discussed mainly research exploring the
relation between empathy and prosocial/moral behavior or motivation.
Other important areas for considering empathy&rsquo;s role in moral
matters have to do with addressing the questions of how and whether
empathy contributes to our ability to distinguish between moral and
conventional norms, to the making of moral judgments, and how empathy
can be appealed to in explicating the normative authority of such
judgments. In considering the first question, psychologists and
philosophers have generally followed Turiel in understanding moral
norms as expressing concerns for &ldquo;rights, justice, and the
welfare of other people&rdquo; (Turiel 1983, 3) and as having a very
specific &ldquo;signature response patterns&rdquo; (Kelly et. al.
2007) associated with it. Moral norms are generally regarded to be
more important than conventional norms in that their normative
validity is conceived as being independent of social authority or
specific social practices and agreements. Their scope is also judged
to be much broader&mdash;they are thought to be valid in other
countries, for example&mdash; and violation of moral norms is
generally understood to be a more serious offense than the violation
of other norms. Notice that in distinguishing between moral and
conventional norms, subjects do not necessarily associate a strict
universality in the Kantian sense with moral norms and view them as
applicable to all rational beings. Indeed, there is some evidence that
6&ndash;9-year-old children, for example, view the moral/conventional
distinction as being fully applicable only to the behavior of
individuals in the in-group and view prescription against harming
members of the out-group to be more like conventional norms (Rhodes
and Chalik 2013). Accordingly, the fact that empathy shows
considerable in-group bias, as discussed above, does not automatically
count as evidence against it playing a role in allowing humans to
distinguish between moral and conventional norms within a social
context.</p>

<p>
Of central importance for assessing the role of empathy for grasping
the moral/conventional distinction has been the research on the nature
of psychopathy and autism. Both pathologies are seen as involving
deficits in different dimensions of empathy. Yet only psychopaths have
great difficulties in living up to moral standards of their societies,
and only they were originally thought of as having difficulties in
appropriately distinguishing between moral and conventional norms
(Blair 1995 and 1996). More specifically, psychopaths show a selective
deficit in affective or emotional empathy, particularly in
&ldquo;processing fearful, sad, and possibly disgusted facial
expressions&rdquo;(Blair 2010, 710). In contrast to persons with
autism, they do not show similar deficits in perspective-taking or
theory of mind capacities. In his 1995 article, Blair therefore blames
the absence of what he calls the Violence Inhibition Mechanism(VIM)
that allows us to respond appropriately to the observed distress cues
in others for the psychopaths&rsquo; moral deficits and their
inability to draw the moral/conventional distinction. In his later
work, he speaks more broadly of a dysfunction of our Integrated
Emotion System (IES), caused by a deficit in the amygdala to properly
represent negative emotions. (Blair, Mitchel, and Blair 2005, for a
recent survey regarding the very specific deficit of psychopaths in
feeling and recognizing fear, see also Marsh 2014). Yet one has to
tread very carefully in drawing definite conclusions about the role of
empathy for morality from the empirical research about psychopathy.
The results of the empirical investigations are far from unified and
do not point in the same direction (For a concise survey, see Maibom
2017). Newer studies, for example, seem to suggest that psychopaths,
as measured by the overall score of the revised psychopathy checklist
(PCL&ndash;R), are able to understand the distinction between moral
and conventional norms if tested under a forced choice paradigm
(Aharoni et. al, 2012). Nevertheless, even that study seems to allow
for the possibility that emotional deficits are responsible for the
psychopath&rsquo;s shortcomings in accurately drawing the distinction
since they are somewhat linked to the affective and antisocial facets
of the PCL&ndash;R. Given the inconsistent results of the various
studies, other researchers prefer to view a psychopath&rsquo;s
immorality not as a specific deficit in empathy, but understand it to
be caused by their general inability to feel strong emotions, by their
general coldheartedness, or even by shortcomings in their rational and
prudential capacities. From that perspective, a psychopath might
understand in an abstract manner that certain things are morally wrong
to do, but he just does not care about morality, the welfare of
another person, or even for himself. (For further discussion, see
Maibom 2005 and 2009, Nichols 2004, and Prinz 2011a,b). Similar
considerations also apply to research regarding subjects with autism.
Kennett (2002)has argued that evidence from autistic individuals,
whose imaginative role-play and thus empathic capacities are
diminished, does not support the claim that empathy is necessary for
moral agency. Yet in her arguments, she only considers the fact that
persons with autism have difficulties with putting themselves in
another person&rsquo;s shoes, but does not consider that they seem to
have some ability to pick up on the emotional states of other people
as revealed by their facial expressions. Moreover, while autistic
subjects in general can distinguish between moral and conventional
norms, they do seem to lack a certain flexibility in evaluating the
seriousness of the violation of a moral norm when they reflect on
moral dilemmas or when they encounter an accidental or unintentional
violation of such norms. (See McGeer 2008, Zalla et. al 2011, but see
also Kennett 2011 and Leslie et. al. 2006 in response).</p>

<p>
Philosophers have not only been interested in appealing to empathy for
explicating the psychological basis for our thinking that certain
norms have moral status. Within the general framework of moral
sentimentalism, which sees morality generally linked to our emotional
responsiveness to the actions of others and ourselves, they have also
appealed to empathy in explicating more generally the nature of moral
judgments (see also Kauppinen 2014 and 2017a). David Hume, for
example, has suggested that moral judgments are based on peculiar
sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation, which are causally
mediated by our ability to empathize&mdash; or what he called
sympathy&mdash; with the pain and pleasures of others (See also
Sayre-McCord 1994 and 2014). More specifically, sentiments of moral
approbations arise in response to our ability to think about and
enliven the pleasure and pain that others feel with the help of our
empathic/sympathetic capacities when we consider the benefits (the
pleasure and pain) that a person&rsquo;s character traits and actions
provide to himself and others. Yet Hume was already quite aware of
some of the above-mentioned limitations and biases of our natural
willingness and capacity to empathize with others. Accordingly, he
insisted that sentiments of approbations can only be conceived of as
moral approbation if empathy/sympathy is regulated or corrected by
what he refers to as &ldquo;steady and general points of view&rdquo;
(Hume 1739&ndash;40 [1978], 581/2) so that our capacity for sympathy
enables us to &ldquo;touch a string, to which all mankind have an
accord and symphony&rdquo; (Hume 1748 [1983], 75). There are several
issues that can be raised in response to Hume&rsquo;s proposal.
Suffice it here to point out that it is difficult to fully understand
how Hume is ultimately able distinguish between judgments about
something being bad and something being morally wrong. Certainly,
natural disasters also cause us to sympathize/empathize with the pain
it cause others, yet such sympathy does not mediate any judgments
about the moral impermissibility of natural disasters. Hume himself
might have thought that he had solved this problem by thinking that
sentiments of moral approbation have a peculiar or distinct character
(see particularly Debes 2012). Yet pointing to the peculiarity of such
sentiments seems to be rather unsatisfying for answering this
challenge.</p>

<p>
Michael Slote, one of the main contemporary proponents of the claim
that empathy plays a constitutive role for moral judgments, does not
follow Hume in thinking that empathy plays a moral role in allowing us
to pick up on a subject&rsquo;s pleasure and pain. Rather, Slote, who
also has been influenced by a feminist ethics of care (Slote 2007,
2010), suggests that empathy is central for moral approval in that we
as spectators empathically pick up on whether or not an agent acted
out of empathic concern for another subject. Moral approval of an
action consists then in the subsequent reflective feeling of warmth
when empathizing with an agent&rsquo;s empathic concern, while moral
disapproval is equivalent to a reflective feeling of chill due to our
recognition that the agent acted without any empathic concern. Actions
are then judged to be morally right or wrong in terms of whether they
can be conceived as the actions of an agent we would morally approve
of in that they are actions done out of empathic concern. Notice also
that while Slote does regard empathy in the above sense to be
constitutive of moral approval only if it is fully or
well&ndash;developed, he does not follow Hume in thinking that empathy
needs to be regulated in order to correct for some of its natural
partiality. Indeed, Slote thinks that this is a virtue of his account
since he regards such partiality as reflected in our moral intuitions.
For example, he thinks that we have a greater moral obligation to help
the child in front of us or members of our family rather than people
who are more removed from us. Slote certainly deserves credit for
reviving the debate about the role of empathy for morality in
contemporary metaethics. Yet his conception of the relation between
empathy and morality has also encountered some skepticism. First of
all, it is questionable that only motivations of empathic concern,
rather than the thought that one is doing the right thing, constitute
proper moral motivations. Second, in light of the above research on
empathy&rsquo;s bias and natural shortcomings, it is rather
questionable to maintain that all aspects of empathy&rsquo;s
partiality are sanctioned by our moral intuitions. It is therefore
hard to see how empathy&rsquo;s moral role can be justified without
appeal to some form of corrective mechanism. (For further discussion,
fundamentally challenging the psychological plausibility of
Slote&rsquo;s account, see D&rsquo;Arms 2011, Kauppinen 2014 and
2017a, and Prinz 2001a,b).</p>

<p>
There is one additional element to consider when debating
empathy&rsquo;s contribution to morality. Philosophers are not merely
interested in answering factual and causal questions of why we care
about morality, what causal role empathy plays in this respect, or how
empathy causally contributes to allowing us to distinguish between
moral and conventional norms and to judge what is morally right or
wrong. They are also interested in genuinely normative questions in
attempting to answer the question of why we should care about morality
and why we should regard moral judgments as making normative demands
on us. In morally blaming other persons, we do assume that we evaluate
their behavior according to standards that they as persons are in some
sense already committed to. We assume that these standards are their
own standards rather than standards that we impose from an external
perspective on them. Unfortunately, even if one would agree with
either David Hume or Michael Slote&rsquo;s account of the causal role
of empathy outlined above, it is doubtful that their account would
help us to answer the genuinely normative question appropriately. Why
exactly should I take a particular emotional reaction of another
person towards me and my action, even if it is a feeling of warmth
caused by empathy, as something that is normatively relevant for me?
Certainly, we all like to be liked and try to fit in with our peer
group, but then moral judgments would be nothing more than a glorified
form of peer pressure. Hume might respond that we should take them
seriously because they are responses from the general point of view,
but that in itself seems to be begging the question of why such a
perspective is articulating the appropriate normative standard for
judging our behavior and character (For an attempt to ground morality
without appeal to an impartial perspective in light of
phenomenological reflections on empathy and sympathy, see however
Drummond 2022). This is also exactly the reason why philosophers with
Kantian inclinations have been skeptical about moral sentimentalism
and positions that think of empathy as a foundation of morality (for a
nice explication of Kant&rsquo;s critical view of sympathy, see
Deimling 2017). Contemporary &ldquo;Kantians&rdquo; do at times,
however, admit that empathy and perspective-taking are epistemically
relevant for moral deliberations, even if it is not solely
constitutive for moral agency (Deigh 1996 and 2018; Darwall 2006,
Shermann 1998, For a review see also Oxley 2011). Interestingly,
philosophers sympathetic to moral sentimentalism have particularly
turned to Adam Smith for inspiration in developing empathy-based
accounts of morality and in responding to the above normativity
problem. In contrast to Hume, Smith conceives of empathy/sympathy not
merely as the enlivening of a perceived emotion or feeling but as
imaginative perspective&ndash;taking. In taking up another
person&rsquo;s perspective, we put ourselves in his situation and
imagine how he would respond to the situation, how he would think and
feel about it. If, in bringing another person&rsquo;s point of view
&ldquo;home to ourselves&rdquo; in this manner, we recognize that we
ourselves might have felt or acted like the other person, then we
approve of the other person&rsquo;s sentiment or action; otherwise, we
disapprove. Moreover, such approval constitutes moral approval if we
have empathized with the other from the perspective of the impartial
spectator, a perspective that Smith, like Hume, appeals to in order to
correct for empathy&rsquo;s natural shortcomings. More importantly,
some authors think that within the Smithian framework, we also find
some answers to the normativity problem. They think that the impartial
spectator perspective can be recast as an implicit commitment of our
ordinary practice of making sense of each other as rational and
emotional creatures with the help of empathic perspective taking
(Stueber 2017) or argue that Smithian perspective&ndash;taking
involves quasi-Kantian commitments to the dignity of a person,
including his or her affective dimension. (Debes 2017, Fleischacker
2019, Fricke 2005, Kauppinen 2017b, and Roughley 2018).</p>
