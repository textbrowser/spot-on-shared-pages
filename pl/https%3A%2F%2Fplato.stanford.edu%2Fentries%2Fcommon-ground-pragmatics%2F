<h1>Common Ground in Pragmatics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Oct 3, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Compare and contrast the following scenarios. In the first, Betty
sends Fred an email saying that she will be in town tomorrow, and then
sends the same message to Barney. In the second scenario, Betty
addresses the two men jointly with one message. In both scenarios,
Barney and Fred are apprised of the fact that Betty will be in town
tomorrow, but otherwise their information states are palpably
different: whereas in the first scenario they unwittingly share the
same information, in the second scenario, it is common ground between
the two men that Betty will be in town tomorrow.</p>

<p>
Common ground is a central notion in pragmatics, and a fixture in
discussions of reference, presupposition, speech acts, implicature,
language conventions, fiction, and many other topics related to
language use. Stalnaker (2014: 2) introduces common ground as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a body of information that is presumed to be shared by the parties to
a discourse, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and descriptions like this abound in the literature. However, it is
generally understood that common ground </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is a <em>sine qua non</em> for everything we do with others&mdash;from
the broadest joint activities to the smallest joint actions that
comprise them. (Clark 1996: 92)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the context of a discourse is the indefinitely large surroundings
of the exchange, common ground is that part of the context that is
shared, in some special sense that remains to be elucidated, between
interlocutors. The pink marble in my pocket is part of the contexts in
which I interact with others, but it isn&rsquo;t common ground until I
reveal it to them, verbally, manually, or otherwise. The nature of
that special kind of sharing is controversial, and it is our main
topic.</p>

<p>
The bulk of this entry is devoted to the three main views on common
ground: the container view, which treats common ground as a set of
possible worlds or propositions; the mentalist view, which takes it to
be a structure of mental states; and the normative view, according to
which common ground is a structure of normative states. Each of these
views is associated with a distinctive take on pragmatics and
specifically on how speech acts change the common ground.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
While the notion of common ground goes back at least as far as C.S.
Peirce (Pietarinen 2004, 2006), the term &ldquo;common ground&rdquo;
was introduced in pragmatics by Paul Grice, who used it in his William
James lectures of 1967 (Grice 1989). It gained some traction during
the 1970s (Stalnaker 1978; Karttunen &amp; Peters 1979), and then
became firmly established, though it always had to compete with
synonyms and near-synonyms. In the early 1990s, Clark (1992: 21)
listed nine alternative terms that, at the time, were being used in
roughly the same way: &ldquo;shared knowledge&rdquo;,
&ldquo;conversational context&rdquo;, &ldquo;common set of
presumptions&rdquo;, &ldquo;shared sets&rdquo;, &ldquo;contextual
domain&rdquo;, &ldquo;tacit assumptions&rdquo;, &ldquo;pragmatic
presuppositions&rdquo;, &ldquo;normal beliefs&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;mutual beliefs&rdquo;. Many of these were short-lived, but
there is a family of labels that remains current. They are
collocations formed by prefixing an adjective like
&ldquo;mutual&rdquo;, &ldquo;common&rdquo;, or &ldquo;joint&rdquo;, to
a noun like &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;belief&rdquo;,
&ldquo;information&rdquo;, or &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo;; hence
&ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;mutual acceptance&rdquo;,
&ldquo;joint belief&rdquo;, and so on.</p>

<p>
In practice, this terminological free-for-all hasn&rsquo;t done much
harm, but it is liable to cause misunderstandings when a variety of
views on common ground are under discussion, as is the case here. In
order to contain the confusion somewhat, readers are advised, as a
rule of thumb, to construe quoted expressions like &ldquo;common
knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutual belief&rdquo; as synonymous with
&ldquo;common ground&rdquo;. In my own usage, &ldquo;mutual&rdquo;
will be firmly associated with common ground and &ldquo;shared&rdquo;
will be its superordinate until
 <a href="#NormPragCommGrou">&sect;4.2</a>,
 where the two adjectives become synonyms.</p>

<p>
Communication and common ground are mutually dependent and affect one
another. On the one hand, our utterances depend on the common ground
in numerous ways. Pronouns are a familiar example: an utterance of
&ldquo;She did it&rdquo; will not make much sense unless it is settled
what &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rdquo; refer to, and these
expressions take their referents from the common ground. And this is
by no means an isolated example; common ground is a stock ingredient
in theories of definite descriptions (Clark &amp; Marshall 1981;
Ludlow 2004 [2022]), fiction and pretence (Eckardt 2014; Semeijn
2021), conversational implicature (Geurts 2010; Green 2017), language
conventions (Lewis 1969; Gilbert 2014; Geurts 2018), lying and
deception (Stokke 2018; Marsili 2023), presupposition (Stalnaker 1970,
1974; Beaver, Geurts, &amp; Denlinger 2021), quantification (Roberts
1995), and many other aspects of pragmatic interpretation.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, our linguistic interactions change the common
ground. Again the instances are legion, and include several of the
cases listed in the last paragraph, but speech acts stand out.
Assertions, questions, commands, greetings, etc. change the common
ground on several levels. For example, if Barney tells Betty,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feed the cat&rdquo;, it becomes common ground
between them not only that Barney uttered the sentence
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feed the cat&rdquo;, but also, and more importantly,
it is now common ground that Barney has expressed his intention and
undertaken the commitment to feed the cat.</p>

<p>
Hence, there are three main questions concerning the general topic of
this entry:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>What is common ground and what distinguishes it from merely shared
information?</li>

<li>How do our linguistic interactions change the common ground?</li>

<li>How do our linguistic interactions rely on and exploit the common
ground?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Our chief question is the first, and since the answers to it differ
widely between theoretical frameworks, sundry approaches to pragmatics
will be considered, too. The relevant differences between these
approaches manifest themselves most clearly in how they treat the
effects of speech acts on the common ground, so the second question
will be addressed at least partially. The third question has
comparatively little bearing on our main topic, and is therefore left
aside.</p>

<h2 id="ContView">2. The Container View</h2>

<p>
The simplest way of conceptualising common ground is as a glass
container filled with information. Glass is best, because the
information must be equally available to all interlocutors. More
formally, the common ground is a set of propositions or possible
worlds that represent what the actual world might be like. Here we
will go with Stalnaker&rsquo;s (1970; 1974) possible-worlds account of
common ground, because it is the
 simplest.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Suppose Betty and Barney agree that it will not rain today, but they
haven&rsquo;t agreed yet whether it will be warm enough for swimming.
Then Betty and Barney&rsquo;s common ground is a set of worlds in
which it will be dry today, while it is true in some and false in
others that it will be warm enough for swimming.</p>

<p>
Now Betty checks out the weather forecast and learns that it will be
24&deg;C (&sim;75&deg;F) in the afternoon, and she rushes to tell
Barney that it will be warm enough for swimming. Then all worlds in
which it is not warm enough for swimming are expunged from Betty and
Barney&rsquo;s common ground. Thus, in this framework, assertion is
defined as a speech act that serves to restrict the common ground
(Stalnaker 1978). More generally, the programme associated with the
container view is to define speech-act types in terms of their effects
on the common ground.</p>

<p>
This view on common ground is highly abstract and as a consequence its
explanatory power is limited (Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero 2015; Harris
2020; Marsili 2023). Consider, for example, how we might analyse
promises along the same lines as assertions. How does a promise change
the common ground, if the common ground is just a set of worlds?
Suppose Barney promises Betty to mow the lawn. It may well be that the
state of affairs Barney undertakes to bring about is adequately
captured by removing from the common ground all worlds in which Barney
fails to mow the lawn. But then we will be treating promises as
assertions, and the two categories become indistinguishable. Similar
issues arise with other speech acts, and while in some cases they have
been addressed, proposed solutions always involve new structures for
speech acts to change. Thus Portner (2007) introduces a &ldquo;to-do
list&rdquo; and proposes that the defining purpose of a command is to
add an item to that list. In the same vein, Roberts (2012) introduces
a stack of &ldquo;questions under discussion&rdquo; for questions to
manipulate. The details of these proposals don&rsquo;t matter here.
What matters is that they are <em>ad hoc</em> in the sense that they
don&rsquo;t make essential use of the framework.</p>

<p>
Another telling illustration of the limited explanatory power of the
container view is that it fails to capture the key distinction between
common ground and information that is merely shared. Consider again
the set of worlds introduced earlier as Betty and Barney&rsquo;s
common ground; call it \(W\). So, by hypothesis, in all worlds in
\(W\) it will be dry today. Now consider an alternative scenario, in
which Betty and Barney merely happen to share the information that it
will be dry today, which is represented by a set of worlds in which it
will be dry today. Call this set \(W'\) and note with alarm that \(W\)
and \(W'\) may well be the same set. That is to say, there is nothing
in the content or structure of a set of worlds to suggest, let alone
imply, that it is anyone&rsquo;s common ground. If we adopt the
container view, the distinction between common ground and merely
shared information is left unaccounted for.</p>

<p>
Conclusion: although the container view may have some heuristic value,
it is too abstract to do much theoretical work under its own
steam.</p>

<h2 id="MentView">3. The Mentalist View</h2>

<h3 id="MentPragCommGrou">3.1 Mentalist pragmatics and common ground</h3>

<p>
Communication is usually described as the transmission or exchange of
information, knowledge, or ideas. In accordance with this
folk-pragmatic picture, mentalist theories of pragmatics concentrate
their attention on the psychological states of speakers and hearers.
On a mentalist account it may be held, for example, that by telling
you that the cat is on the mat, I express my belief in the proposition
that the cat is on the mat, I intend to instil the same belief in you,
and my communicative bid is successful if and only if you come to
believe that the cat is on the mat. This style of analysis has been
developed in many different ways, most of which take their lead from
Grice (1957) by giving pride of place to communicative intentions
(Bach &amp; Harnish 1979; Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995; Stalnaker 2014).
There is considerable variation within this family of accounts, but
that need not concern us here.</p>

<p>
Mentalist pragmatics is naturally twinned with a mentalist conception
of common ground, in which common ground is a structure of mental
states, notably knowledge or belief. For example, Bach and Harnish
(1979: 5) define common ground as mutual belief, which they define as
follows: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Speaker and hearer mutually believe that \(p\) iff:</p>

<ol>

<li id="belief1">both believe \(p\),</li>

<li id="belief2">both believe
 <a href="#belief1">(1)</a>,
 and</li>

<li id="belief3">both believe
 <a href="#belief2">(2)</a>.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

<p>
Which is equivalent to: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Speaker and hearer mutually believe that \(p\) iff: </p>

<ol>

<li id="belief4">both believe \(p\),</li>

<li id="belief5">both believe that both believe \(p\), and</li>

<li id="belief6">both believe that both believe that both believe
\(p\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
On this type of account, the mutuality of common ground is captured in
terms of higher-order belief sharing. If I tell you that the cat is on
the mat, and thereby make you believe that the cat is on the mat, then
you and I share the belief that the cat is on the mat, but not only
that: we also share the belief that we share that belief, and we share
the belief that we share the belief that we share that belief.</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s a lot of belief sharing already, and since there will be
more, it will be useful to have a compact notation to represent
arbitrary orders of belief sharing within a group:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Belief</em>\(_{\langle n\rangle}\) </p>

<ol>

<li>All <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle 1\rangle}\)</span> \(p\)
iff all believe \(p\).</li>

<li>All believe<span class="nobr">\(_{\langle n+1\rangle}\)</span>
\(p\) iff all believe that all <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> \(p\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Using this notation, Bach and Harnish&rsquo;s definition of mutual
belief may be rendered thus:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Speaker and hearer mutually believe that \(p\) iff both <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
3\rangle}\)</span> \(p\).</p>
</div>

<p>
According to this definition, mutual belief is a bounded notion: the
recursion stops at level 3. Proponents of this type of account
typically hold that mutual belief spans a handful of levels, at most,
and that the number of orders is not rigidly fixed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Higher-level beliefs are in principle possible, and indeed among spies
or deceptive intimates there could be divergence at level four or
higher without divergence at the first three levels, but we think such
higher-level beliefs are not possible for a whole community or large
group. (Bach &amp; Harnish 1979: 309)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An industrial-strength conception of mutual belief is obtained by
letting the recursion run free: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Speaker and hearer mutually believe that \(p\) iff they <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> \(p\), for
all&nbsp;\(n\).</p>
</div>

<p>
On this definition, if you and I mutually believe that \(p\), then
both of us believe \(p\), both of us believe that both of us believe
\(p\), and so on forever. Thus construed, common ground requires that
all parties have an infinitely large number of beliefs. This view on
common ground is the best known as well as the most controversial; we
will discuss it in
 <a href="#UnboCommGrou">&sect;3.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
How do speech acts change the common ground? Take assertion, which,
especially amongst philosophers, remains the archetypical speech act
(Pagin &amp; Marsili 2021). Suppose that Wilma says to Betty,
&ldquo;Fred snores&rdquo;, and as a consequence it becomes common
ground between Wilma and Betty that Fred snores. How can that be? In
outline, a mentalist explanation might go as follows. By saying that
Fred snores, Wilma expresses the belief that Fred snores and that she
intends Betty to adopt that belief, too. Betty trusts Wilma to be
truthful and therefore comes to believe that Fred snores. All this is
common ground between Wilma and Betty, and therefore the effect of
Wilma&rsquo;s utterance is that it becomes common ground between them
that Fred snores.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s flesh out this outline on the assumption that common
ground is mutual belief of some order \(n\). So we have: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="flint1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Betty and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that Wilma believes that Fred snores.</dd>
<dt id="flint2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Betty and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that Betty believes that Fred snores.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If common ground is mutual belief, these propositions capture the two
main assumptions of the last paragraph: that it is common ground
between Betty and Wilma (1) that Wilma&rsquo;s assertion is sincere
and (2) that Betty trusts Wilma&rsquo;s assertion to be truthful.
Presumably, both assumptions would hold in a normal run of events, but
both are contingent: Betty may have reason to suspect that Wilma is
mistaken or lying, in which case (1) or (2) or both will fail to be
true, and it will not become common ground that Fred snores. But
suppose that (1) and (2) both hold; then it readily follows that: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="flint3">(3)</dt>
<dd> Betty and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that Betty and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
1\rangle}\)</span> that Fred
snores.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In other words, it is common ground between Betty and Wilma that they
share the belief that Fred snores. This is not quite the same as
saying that it is common ground between Betty and Wilma that Fred
snores, but we&rsquo;re getting there. We just need the following
axiom: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
If \(x\) believes that \(x\) believes that \(p\), then \(x\) believes
that \(p\).</p>
</div>

<p>
If we accept this, as seems reasonable, it is easy to prove that (3)
entails: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="flint4">(4)</dt>
<dd>Betty and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that Fred snores.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Which is to say that it is common ground between Betty and Wilma that
Fred snores. Since \(n\) was arbitrary, this argument goes through
regardless whether mutual belief is bounded or unbounded.</p>

<p>
Although this small case study merely gives a flavour of how, in a
mentalist framework, speech acts may affect the common ground, it
already brings out two important points in which mentalist accounts
differ from the container view. First, speech acts aren&rsquo;t
defined in terms of their effects on the common ground, but rather in
terms of the interlocutors&rsquo; mental states; common ground is less
central to mentalist pragmatics than it is on the container view.
Secondly, any changes in the common ground that a speech act may
trigger are indirect and substantially dependent on the common ground:
it takes quite some common ground for our utterances to change the
common ground.</p>

<h3 id="BuilBlocCommGrou">3.2 The building blocks of common ground</h3>

<p>
Thus far we have considered how common ground may be defined in terms
of beliefs. Other variations on the same mentalist theme use different
mental states as the building blocks of common ground, for example,
knowledge (Clark &amp; Marshall 1981), acceptance (Stalnaker 2014), or
manifestness (Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995); here we will briefly look at
the first and a bit longer at the second. Formally, all these
variations are quite similar to the ones discussed before, for they
all define common ground as mutual \(S\), for some type of mental
state \(S\). For example, mutual knowledge is defined thus: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(p\) is mutual knowledge between the members of a group iff all <span class="nobr">know\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that \(p\) (for some
or all \(n\)).</p>
</div>

<p>
Outside pragmatics, formal theories of mutual knowledge have been
developed by economists, computer scientists, and logicians (Fagin,
Halpern, Moses, &amp; Vardi 1995; Vanderschraaf &amp; Sillari 2023),
but it seems to be generally agreed that knowledge is too strong a
concept for defining common ground. For, if common ground is defined
as mutual knowledge, then \(p\) cannot be common ground unless it is
true that \(p\), and surely we want to allow it to be common ground
between Fred and Barney that Napoleon was Greek, even if they are
wrong.</p>

<p>
What we need, it seems, is a non-factive mental-state concept. Belief
is the most obvious candidate, but there are others. Following
Fraassen (1980), Stalnaker (1984) makes a distinction between
acceptance and belief, where the former is more general than the
latter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Acceptance, as I shall use this term, is a broader concept than
belief; it is a generic propositional attitude concept with such
notions as presupposing, presuming, postulating, positing, assuming
and supposing as well as believing falling under it.
(1984:&#8198;79)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I accept a proposition \(p\) if I treat it as true, which I may do
without believing \(p\), and even if it is common ground that I reject
\(p\) (cf. Bratman 1992; Cohen 1992). For example, I may accept \(p\)
as a working hypothesis in scientific inquiry or with a view to
proving that it is false. These are rather special cases, and indeed,
according to Stalnaker, accepting a proposition without believing it
to be true <em>is</em> a special thing to do.</p>

<p>
Therefore, while Stalnaker (2014) defines common ground as mutual
acceptance, he qualifies his definition by saying that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
belief (and common belief) are the default settings for acceptance for
the purpose of the conversation (and for common ground).
(2014:&#8198;45) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is to say, whereas acceptance is a more general notion than
belief, it defaults to belief, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, and by the
same token, common ground defaults to mutual belief, <em>ceteris
paribus</em>. Hence, in the final analysis, what Stalnaker proposes is
a pluralist account: for the most part, common ground consists of
mutual beliefs, while some propositions are mutually accepted but not
mutually believed. The idea that common ground is a heterogeneous
structure is widely endorsed (Karttunen &amp; Peters 1979; Clark
1996); its ramifications remain under-explored.</p>

<p>
While holding that mutual belief entails mutual acceptance, Stalnaker
also allows for the possibility </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that something is mutually believed, but not part of the common
ground, because one or another of the parties to the conversation is
not prepared to acknowledge that it is mutually believed, and so not
prepared to draw on this information in the conversation. (Stalnaker
2014: 45) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, a driver stopped for speeding might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in a bit of a hurry, is there any way we can settle this right
now?&rdquo;, thereby suggesting a bribe without being upfront about it
(Pinker, Nowak, &amp; Lee 2008; Camp 2018). Following
Stalnaker&rsquo;s suggestion, in this case it would be mutual belief,
but not common ground, that the speaker is offering a bribe. However,
given that, on Stalnaker&rsquo;s account, common ground <em>is</em>
mutual acceptance and entailed by mutual belief, this analysis is
self-contradictory. (For more critical discussion of Stalnaker&rsquo;s
notion of acceptance, see K&ouml;lbel 2011.)</p>

<h3 id="UnboCommGrou">3.3 Unbounded common ground?</h3>

<p>
Whereas bounded notions of common ground haven&rsquo;t caused much
controversy, opinions on unbounded common ground are sharply divided,
with some authors taking it for granted that common ground must be an
infinite structure of mental states, while others dismiss this idea as
absurd on psychological
 grounds.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 In this section, we will first consider the arguments in favour of
the hypothesis that common ground is infinite, and then assess the
arguments against.</p>

<h4 id="CaseBaseArgu">3.3.1 Case-based arguments</h4>

<p>
One way of arguing in favour of unbounded common ground is by way of
example (e.g., Clark &amp; Marshall 1981; Vanderschraaf &amp; Sillari
2023). Informal arguments of this sort tend to be long-winded, and in
the interest of brevity and clarity I will give a comparatively simple
example of my own devising, whose key passage is closely modelled on a
scenario by Vanderschraaf and Sillari (2023). The first stage of the
argument resembles the argument in
 <a href="#MentPragCommGrou">&sect;3.1</a>,
 which served to illustrate how speech acts can change the common
ground, but whereas there common ground was presupposed, here we seek
to prove that infinite common ground is entailed by such acts. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Fred tells Wilma that (\(p\)) there is beer in the fridge. It seems
entirely reasonable to suppose that, in a normal run of events, this
will cause Wilma to believe \(p\), and assuming that Fred isn&rsquo;t
lying he, too, believes \(p\). Hence Fred and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
1\rangle}\)</span> \(p\).</p>

<p>
It is perhaps less evident, but still plausible that Fred and Wilma
come to share the belief that they both believe \(p\). Hence Fred and
Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle 2\rangle}\)</span> \(p\).
But will the recursion continue? Following Vanderschraaf and Sillari,
we now reason as follows: </p>

<ul>

<li>Suppose that Fred and Wilma know that both of them can infer from
\(p\) what the other can infer.</li>

<li>Can Wilma then believe that Fred does not believe that she
believes \(p\)? If Wilma considers this question, she may reason that,
since she herself knows that Fred&rsquo;s statement led her to believe
\(p\), Fred must believe that she believes \(p\), so Wilma believes
that Fred believes that she believes \(p\).</li>

<li> Since the same reasoning applies to Fred, we may conclude that
Fred and Wilma <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
3\rangle}\)</span> \(p\).</li>

<li> And thus the recursion continues <em>ad infinitum</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
It isn&rsquo;t hard to see that this argument is flawed. It offers a
description of how Fred and Wilma <em>may</em> reason, but given that
they <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle n\rangle}\)</span> \(p\),
no argument to the effect that they are entitled or even committed to
<span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle n+1\rangle}\)</span> \(p\) will
prove that they <em>actually</em> <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n+1\rangle}\)</span> \(p\). If common
ground is defined as an infinite structure of beliefs (say), then no
group can have common ground on anything unless each of its members
<em>has</em> infinitely many beliefs, and no argument proving merely
that they are entitled or committed to such-and-such beliefs will
suffice to prove that they actually have them.</p>

<h4 id="LogiCommGrou">3.3.2 The logic of common ground</h4>

<p>
Another and perhaps weightier reason for supposing that common ground
must involve unbounded recursion is that this is a standard feature of
formal theories of mutual knowledge, mutual belief, and related
notions (Vanderschraaf &amp; Sillari 2023). Here we will focus on the
possible-worlds analyses of belief and mutual belief, which
Stalnaker&rsquo;s (2002, 2014) account of common ground is based on
(Fagin et al. 1995; Rendsvig, Symons, &amp; Wang 2023).</p>

<p>
Suppose that Betty believes, wrongly as it happens, that Wilma has a
cold, but is undecided about whether Napoleon was French or not.
Hence, as far Betty can tell, it may be the case that Napoleon was
French or it may be the case that Napoleon was not French. We model
Betty&rsquo;s doxastic state as follows. Let \(p\) be the proposition
that Wilma has a cold and \(q\) the proposition that Napoleon was
French. Then in the actual world, call it \(w_0\), \(p\) is false and
\(q\) is true. Since Betty&rsquo;s belief that \(p\) disagrees with
the facts, her doxastic world is different from \(w_{0}\). Or rather,
her doxastic worldS (plural) are different from \(w_{0}\), because
Betty allows for two possible states of affairs, \(q\) and \(\neg q\),
that exclude one another. In order to represent Betty&rsquo;s wavering
on \(q\) versus \(\neg q\) we introduce two doxastic worlds, \(w_{1}\)
and \(w_{2}\), and stipulate that \(q\) is true in one and false in
the other; \(p\) is true in both worlds. Hence, Betty&rsquo;s doxastic
state may be summarised as follows:</p> 
\[
\begin{align*}
&amp; w_0: \neg p, q\\ 
&amp; w_1: p, q\\ 
&amp; w_2: p, \neg q\\
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
While \(w_{0}\) is the actual world, with Betty in it, \(w_{1}\) and
\(w_{2}\) are &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; to Betty from \(w_{0}\) in the
sense that they represent what the actual world might be like, by
Betty&rsquo;s lights. The relations between these three worlds may be
visualised thus:</p>

<div class="figure center">

<div style="padding-bottom:.8em">

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">
<img src="cg1.svg" style="width: 8em" alt="Three nodes laid out in a triangle with node w0 having arrows pointing to node w1 and node w2." />
</div>

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">

\[
\begin{align*}
&amp; w_0: \neg p, q\\
&amp; w_1: p, q\\
&amp; w_2: p, \neg q\\
\end{align*}
\]

</div>
</div>

<p class="center">
Betty&rsquo;s doxastic state</p>
</div>

<p>
In this graph, the arrows pointing from \(w_0\) to \(w_{1}\) and
\(w_{2}\) represent the doxastic alternatives accessible to Betty from
\(w_0\). That Betty believes \(p\) is represented by the fact that
\(p\) is true in all of her doxastic alternatives; her wavering about
\(q\) is represented by the fact that \(q\) is true in some but not
all accessible worlds.</p>

<p>
Different people have different beliefs, which require different
accessibility structures. For example, suppose that Barney&rsquo;s
doxastic state agrees with Betty&rsquo;s except that he considers it
possible that Wilma doesn&rsquo;t have a cold:</p>

<div class="figure center">

<div style="padding-bottom:0em">

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">
<img src="cg2.svg" style="width: 10em" alt="four nodes with node w0 having arrows pointing to node w1, node w2, and node w3." />
</div>

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">

\[
\begin{align*}
&amp; w_0: \neg p, q\\
&amp; w_1: p, q\\
&amp;  w_2: p, \neg q\\
&amp;  w_3: \neg p, \neg q\\
\end{align*}
\]

</div>
</div>

<p class="center">
Barney&rsquo;s doxastic state</p>
</div>

<p>
In this model \(p\) is true in some but not all accessible worlds, and
therefore Barney doesn&rsquo;t believe \(p\); he merely considers it
possible that \(p\).</p>

<p>
In the foregoing examples, all arrows leave from the same world, but
the possible-worlds framework admits of richer structures, too:</p>

<div class="figure center">

<div style="padding-bottom:.8em">

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">
<img src="cg3.svg" style="width: 8em" alt="Three nodes laid out in a triangle with node w0 having arrows pointing to node w1 and node w2. Node w1 has an arrow pointing to node w2; and node w2 and arrow pointing to node w1." />
</div>

<div style="width:8em; display: inline-block; vertical-align:middle">

\[
\begin{align*}
&amp; w_0: \neg p, q\\
&amp; w_1: p, q\\
&amp; w_2: p, \neg q\\
\end{align*}
\]

</div>
</div>

<p class="center">
Fred&rsquo;s doxastic state</p>
</div>

<p>
Fred&rsquo;s doxastic state is the same as Betty&rsquo;s, except that
\(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\) are accessible to each other. Thus, the model
represents information not only about Fred&rsquo;s beliefs, but also
about his beliefs about his beliefs. To explain this, recall that, in
the possible-worlds framework, an individual \(x\) believes \(p\) iff
\(p\) is true in all worlds that are accessible from \(x\)&rsquo;s
world. Given that \(w_{2}\) is the only world that is accessible from
\(w_{1}\) and vice versa, and that \(p\) is true in both worlds, we
have: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd> In \(w_{1}\), Fred believes that \(p\) (because \(p\) is true in
\(w_{2}\)).</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>In \(w_{2}\), Fred believes that \(p\) (because \(p\) is true in
\(w_{1}\)).</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>In \(w_{1}\), Fred believes that he believes that \(p\) (because
(1b) holds).</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>In \(w_{2}\), Fred believes that he believes that \(p\) (because
(1a) holds).</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>And so on.</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Since \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\) are the only worlds accessible from
\(w_{0}\), it follows that, in \(w_{0}\), Fred believes that \(p\), he
believes that he believes that \(p\), and so on.</p>

<p>
This case demonstrates the elegance and the power of the
possible-worlds framework. Our model of Fred&rsquo;s doxastic state is
obviously finite, and not only that, it is quite small, to boot: three
nodes interconnected by four arrows. And yet, this very simple finite
structure supports infinitely many beliefs about beliefs. At the same
time, our model of Fred&rsquo;s doxastic state raises doubts about the
framework. It is widely agreed, and with good reason, that it is
psychologically challenging to have higher-order mental states, let
alone mental states of any order (Armstrong forthcoming). This
consensus seems to clash with the simplicity of the model. For at
least at first blush it appears unlikely that an infinitely large
configuration of mental states reduces to such a trivial structure.
Something has got to give: either the accepted wisdom about the
complexities of belief is mistaken or else something is amiss with the
possible-worlds analysis.</p>

<p>
I think it&rsquo;s the latter, but first let us see how mutual belief
is captured in the possible-worlds framework. This turns out to be
surprisingly straightforward; it&rsquo;s simply a matter of merging
doxastic states (Fagin et al. 1995; Stalnaker 2014). Fred and
Wilma&rsquo;s individual doxastic states are both represented by
structures consisting of a set of worlds and an accessibility
relation. If these structures are merged, we obtain the same kind of
structure, which may be seen as representing the doxastic state of the
Flintstones as a couple, including the couple&rsquo;s beliefs, which
are Fred and Wilma&rsquo;s mutual beliefs. Thus, the mutual beliefs of
a group are derived from the beliefs of its individual members by
merging accessibility structures (more precisely, by taking their
transitive union).</p>

<p>
This, then, is standard doxastic logic, which according to Stalnaker
(2002, 2014), is the logic of belief as well as acceptance, and
therefore the logic of common ground. If that were true, it would
vindicate the view that common ground is an infinite structure of
mental states. However, doxastic logic is widely agreed to be ill-cast
as a theory of belief. This is conceded even by its advocates, who
readily admit that the theory is &ldquo;highly idealized&rdquo; and
may be applicable &ldquo;only to idealized knowers&mdash;those with
superhuman logical capacities&rdquo; (Stalnaker 2006: 172). The
problem is that some of the logic&rsquo;s constitutive principles are
way too strong. For example, one of its principal tenets is that you
believe everything that logically follows from what you believe: </p>

<dl class="indent">
<dt class="italic">Closure under entailment</dt>
<dd>If \(p\) entails \(q\) and \(x\) believes \(p\), then \(x\)
believes \(q\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Given that, in a possible-worlds framework, belief is defined as
universal quantification over worlds (\(x\) believes \(p\) iff \(p\)
is true in <em>all</em> worlds accessible to \(x\)), it necessarily
follows that beliefs are closed under entailment. It isn&rsquo;t hard
to see that this has unpalatable consequences. It implies, for
example, that since mathematical truths hold in all worlds, everyone
who believes anything at all inevitably believes that the Pythagorean
theorem is true. But sadly, it is an all too familiar fact about the
human condition that we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> believe everything that
is entailed by what we believe.</p>

<p>
A less controversial principle, which is standardly accepted in
doxastic logic, is the
 following:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<dl class="indent">
<dt class="italic">Stacking</dt>
<dd>If \(x\) believes \(p\), then \(x\) believes that \(x\) believes
\(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
On the face of it, this may seem plausible. But what plausibility it
has begins to wither when we let the recursion run for more than three
or four iterations. For example, if the Stacking principle holds, it
is <em>logically impossible</em> for Betty to believe that Napoleon
was Greek unless she also believes that she believes that she believes
that she believes that she believes that she believes that she
believes that she believes that she believes that she believes that
Napoleon was Greek. This doesn&rsquo;t feel right, at all.</p>

<p>
Nothing in the above is to imply that doxastic logic is just a bad
idea. It is merely to say that it is inadequate as a theory of mental
states and therefore fails to support the view that common ground is
an infinite structure of such states. In
 <a href="#NormView">&sect;4</a>
 it will be shown that, on some non-mentalist construals of common
ground, it may plausibly be held that common ground is infinite and
that doxastic logic is its logic.</p>

<h4 id="CaseAgaiUnboCommGrou">3.3.3 The case against unbounded common ground</h4>

<p>
The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that, as things currently
stand, there are no compelling arguments in favour of the view that
mentalist common ground is unbounded. However, it is often said that
the mentalist view must be wrong, because it creates fatal processing
issues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
How exactly do the speaker and hearer distinguish between knowledge
that they merely share, and knowledge that is genuinely mutual? To
establish this distinction, they would have, in principle, to perform
an infinite series of checks, which clearly cannot be done in the
amount of time it takes to produce and understand an utterance.
(Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This line of argument is seriously flawed. It presupposes that the
entire series of propositions that define common ground must be
verified, one after the other, in order to establish that there is
common ground. If that were true, the notion that common ground is
unbounded would indeed be untenable. But we have seen how, in a
mentalist framework, new common ground may be created in the wake of
our communicative exchanges, regardless whether it is bounded or
unbounded
 (<a href="#MentPragCommGrou">&sect;3.1</a>),
 and more importantly, we have seen that there are various ways of
representing unbounded common ground in a succinct manner; for
example: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Everyone <span class="nobr">believes\(_{\langle n\rangle}\),</span>
for all \(n\).</p>
</div>

<p>
That&rsquo;s 31 characters, spaces and punctuation included, and
whether or not this particular definition is plausible from a
psychological point of view, it proves by way of example that a simple
and compact representation of unbounded common ground is possible.</p>

<p>
The problem is not that unbounded common ground, mentalistically
construed, would be impossible for finite creatures to represent, or
that such creatures couldn&rsquo;t decide whether they had it. Rather,
the problem is an ontological one: if common ground is unbounded
mutual belief (say), then there cannot be common ground unless all
parties actually <em>have</em> infinitely many distinct beliefs. Is
that possible?</p>

<p>
Obviously, the answer to this question hinges on what beliefs
<em>are</em> (Wilby 2010; Scarafone 2021), which is a controversial
topic, to put it mildly. Beliefs have been variously held to be mental
representations, physical states, functional states, behavioural
dispositions, or a combination of several of the aforementioned, and
then there is also the view that beliefs don&rsquo;t exist in the
first place (Schwitzgebel 2006 [2023]). While that debate is about the
nature of beliefs (if there are any), here we are concerned with the
role that beliefs are to play in pragmatic theory. This is a major
foundational issue and it is compounded by the fact that beliefs may
have more than one role to play. On the one hand, it may be supposed
that pragmatics is concerned with, <em>inter alia</em>, the beliefs
that language users <em>have</em>. On the other hand, pragmatics is
often supposed to be concerned with the beliefs that language users
<em>attribute</em> to others and themselves. Neither view entails the
other; it is not inconsistent to deny the existence of beliefs and
affirm that belief attribution exists. But if both views are endorsed
together, as they often are, then the question of whether mutual
belief can be unbounded presents itself twice, and the answer need not
be the same in both cases. For example, if beliefs are physical states
and attributed beliefs behavioural dispositions, then mutual belief
might be argued to be more problematic in the first sense than in the
second.</p>

<p>
The upshot of the foregoing discussion is simply this. In order to
decide whether, on a mentalist construal, the notion of unbounded
common ground is coherent at all, a considerable amount of
foundational groundwork needs to be done first. In the meantime,
it&rsquo;s probably best to postpone our verdict and treat this notion
as alive but not
 kicking.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
In one of the first contributions to the literature on mutual
knowledge, Schiffer (1972) tried to defuse the problem under
discussion by appealing to a distinction between explicit and implicit
knowledge. The same distinction can and has been made for belief, so
Schiffer&rsquo;s argument applies to mutual belief, as well. He
reasoned as follows. Most of our everyday knowledge is implicit in the
sense that it involves propositions that we never considered or will
consider. For example, an Oxford philosophy don who never considered
whether his maternal grandmother was married to Benito Mussolini may
still be said to know that that is not the case (Schiffer 1972: 36).
Schiffer claimed that this is how we know most of the propositions
that constitute mutual knowledge. Put otherwise, mutual knowledge is
largely implicit, and since implicit knowledge is not represented
explicitly, mutual knowledge is achievable with finite resources.</p>

<p>
This argument is flawed. Whereas we are prepared to grant the Oxford
don his knowledge because he can infer it immediately and effortlessly
from what he knows explicitly, it is out of the question that,
starting with the first three or four orders of shared knowledge, we
can immediately and effortlessly infer any further order. Moreover,
whereas Schiffer&rsquo;s don would readily and unreflectingly avow
that his maternal grandmother wasn&rsquo;t married to Benito
Mussolini, I&rsquo;m sure that nobody (not even a congregation of
Oxford dons) will readily and unreflectingly avow that they <span class="nobr">know\(_{\langle
76\rangle}\)</span> \(p\), say. Hence,
while the distinction between explicit and implicit knowledge may be
plausible and may plausibly extend to mutual knowledge, it will not
help to justify the claim that mutual knowledge is unbounded.</p>

<h3 id="Conc">3.4 Conclusion</h3>

<p>
There is no doubt that people attribute mental states to each other
and themselves, and that at least some of these mental states are
higher-order beliefs or higher-order knowledge. After all, people
<em>say</em> things like, &ldquo;I believe that Barney believes that
Betty is cheating on him&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Barney knows that Betty
knows that he is cheating on her&rdquo;. It is an open question how
common this practice is, nor is it certain at all that we
<em>covertly</em> engage in such attributions on a regular basis. But
while these issues remain to be settled, the least we can say for now
is that the mentalist view on common ground is coherent and receives
some support from empirical facts. Provided, that is, that common
ground is bounded. For, if it is a structure of mental states, the
notion that common ground is unbounded, i.e., that this structure is
infinitely large, is very much in dispute: the arguments in its favour
are weak, at best, and although the arguments against it don&rsquo;t
settle the matter, this notion is widely mistrusted.</p>

<p>
It bears emphasising that this issue only concerns mentalist theories
of common ground. As we will see in the upcoming section,
non-mentalist theories need not be affected by it, and may entail with
impunity that common ground is unbounded.</p>

<h2 id="NormView">4. Normative Views</h2>

<p>
And now for something completely different. We switch to a
non-mentalist stance and proceed to discuss two views on common ground
in which normativity plays a key role. These views differ greatly from
one another, but share two signal features. First, while it is
controversial whether mental states like belief have a logic at all,
the normative accounts that we&rsquo;ll be discussing arguably have
logics of the kind discussed in the foregoing. Second, and relatedly,
on either account it may be held that common ground is unbounded.</p>

<h3 id="ReasBeli">4.1 Reasons to believe</h3>

<p>
In his seminal monograph on convention, David Lewis (1969) outlined a
theory of what he dubbed &ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo;.
Unfortunately, that was a misnomer, as Lewis (1978: 44) came to
realise, but the label stuck and it is still widely held that, in his
book, Lewis proposed an account of common knowledge. He didn&rsquo;t.
In reality, what he proposed was a type of structure consisting of
&ldquo;reasons to believe&rdquo;. In the parlance and notation of this
entry, Lewis proposed that \(p\) is common ground between the members
of a group iff everyone has-reason-to-<span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that \(p\), for all
\(n\). Hence, Lewisian common ground (which he called &ldquo;common
knowledge&rdquo;) is unbounded.</p>

<p>
According to Lewis, \(p\) is common ground between the members of a
group in situation \(S\) iff \(S\) meets the following conditions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Everyone has reason to believe that they are in \(S\).</li>

<li>\(S\) indicates to everyone that everyone has reason to believe
that they are in \(S\).</li>

<li>\(S\) indicates to everyone that \(p\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The key primitives in this analysis are &ldquo;reason to
believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;indication&rdquo;, and although Lewis
hadn&rsquo;t much to say about either, he made it clear that
&ldquo;\(S\) indicates to \(x\) that&#8198;&hellip;&rdquo; may be read
as &ldquo;\(S\) gives \(x\) reason to believe
that&#8198;&hellip;&rdquo;; which leaves us with &ldquo;reason to
believe&rdquo; as the key primitive in Lewis&rsquo;s account.</p>

<p>
Lewis claimed that these three conditions, &ldquo;together with
suitable ancillary premises regarding our rationality, inductive
standards, and background information&rdquo; (1969: 53), generate
infinitely many orders of shared reasons to believe; the mutuality of
common ground is captured in terms of higher-order sharing of reasons
to believe, and Lewisian common ground is unbounded. Although
Lewis&rsquo;s &ldquo;ancillary premises&rdquo; may seem rather
formidable, they play a relatively minor role in his argument. Even
so, the informal proof with which Lewis supported his claim is
insufficient, but in the meantime several fixes have been suggested,
notably by Cubitt &amp; Sugden (2003), Sillari (2008), and Vromen
(2024). Between these proposals, Vromen&rsquo;s stays the closest to
Lewis&rsquo;s proof, for he shows that common ground is entailed by
Lewis&rsquo;s premises supplemented with a minimal and independently
motivated theory of reasons to believe.</p>

<p>
While Lewis&rsquo;s overriding concern was with the analysis of
conventions, it isn&rsquo;t hard to see how his account of common
ground may be applied to speech acts. Suppose that the primary
function of an assertion that \(p\) is to give the hearer reason to
believe that \(p\) and requires that a cooperative speaker has reason
to believe that \(p\) (Grice 1957; Kissine 2013). Consider again the
incident of Wilma telling Betty that Fred snores
 (<a href="#MentPragCommGrou">&sect;3.1</a>).
 It seems reasonable to suppose that, if Wilma says, &ldquo;Fred
snores&rdquo;, then Wilma must have and Betty is given reason to
believe that Fred snores, and that a situation \(S\) ensues which
meets Lewis&rsquo;s conditions: </p>

<ul>

<li>Both Betty and Wilma have reason to believe that they are in
\(S\).</li>

<li>\(S\) indicates to both that both have reason to believe that they
are in \(S\).</li>

<li>\(S\) indicates to both that Fred snores.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then a suitably amended version of Lewis&rsquo;s proof shows that, in
this situation, Betty and Wilma have-reason-to-<span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> that Fred snores,
for all \(n\).</p>

<p>
Reasons to believe aren&rsquo;t beliefs any more than reasons to
complain are complaints. Reasons to believe are normative attributes:
if Barney has reason to believe that his boss is a fool, then he is
entitled to believe that she is a fool, and under some conditions he
ought to form that belief. But the two attributes are doubly
dissociated: it is perfectly possible not to believe what one has
reason to believe, and vice versa. Moreover, whereas doxastic logic is
ill-suited as a theory of belief
 (<a href="#UnboCommGrou">&sect;3.3</a>),
 it is a lot more promising as a theory of reasons to believe. For
example, it is at least prima facie plausible that the following
principles hold: </p>

<dl class="indent">
<dt class="italic">Closure under entailment</dt>
<dd>If \(p\) entails \(q\) and \(x\) has reason to believe \(p\), then
\(x\) has reason to believe \(q\).</dd>
<dt class="italic">Stacking</dt>
<dd>If \(x\) has reason to believe \(p\), then \(x\) has reason to
believe that \(x\) has reason to believe \(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
By the same token, a Lewisian account of unbounded common ground is
immune to the issues that beset its mentalist counterpart
 (<a href="#UnboCommGrou">&sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
One of the most remarkable (and least appreciated) features of
Lewis&rsquo;s theory is that it gives beliefs their due as well. For,
on Lewis&rsquo;s account, common ground may guide belief
<em>formation</em>, along the following lines. Given that \(x\) and
\(y\) have reason to believe that \(p\), they may come to actually
believe that \(p\), provided they have the cognitive resources for
making this inference; and given that \(x\) and \(y\) both have reason
to believe that both believe that \(p\), both may come to believe that
both believe that \(p\), provided they have the cognitive resources
for making <em>this</em> inference. But as the cognitive resources
needed to make these inferences increase from order to order, only the
first few orders of belief will be formed, and thus \(x\) and \(y\)
come to <span class="nobr">believe\(_{\langle n\rangle}\)</span> that
\(p\), for some small \(n\). In this way, mutual beliefs may track the
lower region of Lewisian common ground, but only up to a point. As
early as 1969, Lewis demonstrated, in effect, that a normative account
of unbounded common ground may coexist and be integrated with a
mentalist account of bounded common ground.</p>

<h3 id="NormPragCommGrou">4.2 Normative pragmatics and common ground</h3>

<p>
Apart from the container view, the various perspectives on common
ground considered so far are all individualist in the sense that
common ground is taken to be constituted by individual attributes; for
it is individuals who know, believe, accept, or have reason to believe
that such-and-such is the case. We now consider a non-individualist
perspective, in which common ground is viewed as consisting of social
relations between individuals, which, like reasons to believe, are
normative, though their normativity is of a rather different sort.</p>

<p>
Human sociality is intensely normative. We habitually treat each other
as having normative statuses: commitments, responsibilities,
permissions, and so forth (Brandom 1994; Walton &amp; Krabbe 1995;
Kukla &amp; Lance 2009). For example, when I get into a taxi, my
normative status and the driver&rsquo;s are thereby augmented with
commitments that didn&rsquo;t exist a moment ago: I am now supposed to
inform the driver about my destination, he is supposed to take me
there, I am supposed to pay him for that service, and so on.</p>

<p>
While, on the one hand, our normative statuses govern our actions and
interactions, on the other hand, they are shaped by them, too. The
central tenet of normative pragmatics is that the latter is the chief
purpose of language: our communicative exchanges serve to alter and
sustain our normative statuses (Brandom 1994; Kibble 2006a, 2006b;
Kukla &amp; Lance 2009; Carassa &amp; Colombetti 2009, 2011;
Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero 2015; Krifka 2015; Geurts 2019; Scarafone
2021; Shardimgaliev 2022). Promising is the emblematic case. If I
promise to call you tomorrow, I thereby become committed to you to act
in certain ways and not in others (Searle 1969; Gilbert 2014; Habib
2008 [2022]). Hence, my commitment has a relational structure with
three terms: you, me, and the proposition that I will call you
tomorrow. More generally, commitments are of the form \(Cxy(p)\),
where \(x\) and \(y\) are individuals and \(p\) is some content. This
tripartite structure is often left implicit, but in many accounts it
is explicit (Castelfranchi 1995; Royakkers &amp; Dignum 2000; Singh
2000; Kibble 2006a, 2006b; Yamada 2012; Geurts 2019).</p>

<p>
The constituent parts of normative statuses fall into two main
classes. On the one hand, there are modes of necessity, like
commitment, obligation, and responsibility; on the other hand, there
are modes of possibility, like entitlement, permission, and consent.
Here we are primarily concerned with commitments, which may be
subdivided in various ways, two of which deserve special mention. One
is the distinction between discursive and non-discursive commitments,
which govern linguistic and non-linguistic acts, respectively. For
example, if Fred promised Wilma to mow the lawn, he is
non-discursively committed to mowing the lawn and he is discursively
committed to refrain from saying or implying that he will not mow the
lawn. Another distinction is that between propositional commitments
and commitments to action, which have been taken to define assertions
and promises, respectively. On some accounts, propositional
commitments are a subclass of commitments to action. For example,
Brandom (1994) holds that an assertion commits the speaker to justify
her claim when challenged (cf. Walton &amp; Krabbe 1995; Kibble 2006a,
2006b). Note that this commitment is propositional as well as
discursive.</p>

<p>
There is considerable variation within the extensive family of
normative theories of pragmatics. There are differences in scope, with
many theories focusing on a single speech act, usually assertion,
while others aim to cover a broader range of utterance types.
Moreover, and relatedly, there are diverging opinions on what types of
commitment are crucial for pragmatics. For example, while Brandom
(1994), for whom &ldquo;asserting is the fundamental speech act&rdquo;
(1994: 173), confines his attention to discursive commitments,
theories seeking to encompass promises or requests, for example, tend
to employ non-discursive commitments, as well (Hamblin 1987; Walton
&amp; Krabbe 1995; Geurts 2019). In the following, we will cut through
all this diversity, and use the root &ldquo;commit&rdquo; in a fairly
non-committal way. However, unless indicated otherwise, we will only
be concerned with propositional commitments, i.e., commitments to the
truth of a given proposition. The only substantive premise that will
be needed for tying together commitments with common ground is that
commitments are relations which comply with a principle of
&ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; (Gilbert 2014; Geurts 2019).</p>

<p>
Suppose Fred tells Barney that he saw a squirrel on the roof. Then,
normally speaking, Fred and Barney will come to share a commitment to
the truth of the proposition that Fred saw a squirrel on the roof:
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(x\) and \(y\) share a commitment to the truth of \(p\) iff
\(Cxy(p)\) and \(Cyx(p)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that, thus defined, commitment sharing has an element of
mutuality that is lacking in shared belief or shared reasons to
believe. Intuitively, whereas two individuals may share a belief by
accident, commitment sharing is symmetrical and non-accidental.</p>

<p>
Now suppose that Barney distrusts Fred&rsquo;s visual acuity, and
isn&rsquo;t convinced that his neighbour really saw a squirrel. So he
asks: &ldquo;Are you sure? I&rsquo;ve never seen any squirrels in our
neighbourhood&rdquo;. The implication of Barney&rsquo;s response is
that he is not prepared to share Fred&rsquo;s commitment, though he is
willing to accept that Fred is committed to the truth of the
proposition that he saw a squirrel on the roof. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(y\) accepts \(x\)&rsquo;s commitment to the truth of \(p\) iff
\(Cyx(Cxy(p))\).</p>
</div>

<p>
In everyday face-to-face communication, acceptance and sharing are
often signalled (&ldquo;Mhm&rdquo;, &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;,&hellip;), but
they may also be merely implied by the hearer&rsquo;s response, and in
the absence of overt clues acceptance and/or sharing are often taken
for granted. Note that, as defined here, acceptance is something
completely different from its Stalnakerian namesake
 (<a href="#BuilBlocCommGrou">&sect;3.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Given that commitment is a normative relation, it is not surprising
that at least some of the logical principles that are plausible for
reasons to believe
 (<a href="#ReasBeli">&sect;4.1</a>)
 are plausible for commitments, too: </p>

<dl class="indent">
<dt class="italic">Closure under entailment</dt>
<dd>If \(p\) entails \(q\) and \(Cxy(p)\), then \(Cxy(q)\).</dd>
<dt class="italic">Stacking</dt>
<dd>If \(Cxy(p)\) then \(Cxy(Cxy(p))\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I&rsquo;m claiming plausibility for these principles mainly to
highlight the contrast between normative notions like commitment and
reason to believe, on the one hand, and mentalist notions like
knowledge, belief, and Stalnakerian acceptance, on the other. Only
Stacking will play a role in the following, and a minor one at
that.</p>

<p>
Principles like the above establish logical connections between
commitments of the form \(Cxy(\ldots)\), i.e., \(x\)&rsquo;s
commitments to \(y\). Are there any logical principles that plausibly
connect \(x\)&rsquo;s commitments to \(y\) with \(y\)&rsquo;s
commitments to \(x\)? I have argued that there is such a principle and
that it is motivated by our practices of commitment making (Geurts
2019). The proposed principle is that \(x\) cannot have a commitment
to \(y\) unless \(y\) accepts that \(x\) is so committed: </p>

<dl class="indent" id="acceptance">
<dt class="italic">Acceptance</dt>
<dd>If \(Cxy(p)\) then \(Cyx(Cxy(p))\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To motivate this principle, let&rsquo;s begin with Gilbert&rsquo;s
(2014) remarks on promising and promises. According to Gilbert, if one
person makes a promise to another, then </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>both are active in the process of constructing the promise</em>.
More precisely, the promisee must do something of an accepting rather
than a rejecting. (2014:&nbsp;318, emphasis in the original) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To return to an earlier example, suppose that, in an attempt at making
a promise, Fred tells Wilma: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mow the lawn&rdquo;.
Then his attempt will fall flat, and no promise will have been made,
if Wilma turns him down, for instance, by saying: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,
you&rsquo;re joking, you never mowed the lawn and you have no
intention of doing so&rdquo;. Now it may seem that Fred still made a
promise in some sense, but even if he did, it didn&rsquo;t result in a
commitment that Wilma can hold him to. For that requires
&ldquo;something of an accepting&rdquo;, as Gilbert puts it.</p>

<p>
Gilbert&rsquo;s discussion of acceptance is rather terse, but she does
say that acceptance doesn&rsquo;t require a verbal response and that
mere acknowledgement is not enough: if Wilma responds with &ldquo;I
hear you&rdquo;, then Fred still doesn&rsquo;t have a commitment to
her. However, Gilbert&rsquo;s remarks accord with ample evidence
showing that, quite generally, people are active contributors to the
discourse even when it isn&rsquo;t their turn to speak (Clark 1996;
Bavelas, Coates, &amp; Johnson 2000; Enfield 2017). Hearers&rsquo;
real-time responses come in many forms, including various kinds of
affirmative signals (&ldquo;okay&rdquo;, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;,
&ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;yeah&rdquo;, &ldquo;mhm&rdquo;) and body
language (nodding, shrugging, eye gaze, facial expressions). They may
express a variety of states, ranging from understanding and interest
to emotions like empathy, horror, or disgust. But their principal
function is to express acceptance and agreement.</p>

<p>
The Acceptance principle is in line with these facts. It generalises
Gilbert&rsquo;s observations about promissive commitments to
commitments in general, by explicating acceptance in terms of
commitment. It isn&rsquo;t hard to see that this creates infinite
cascades of commitments, and in fact we obtain the same recursive
structures that define mutual belief and mutual reasons to believe. To
show how, we define <span class="nobr">commitment\(_{\langle
n\rangle}\)</span> in the by now usual way: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em><span class="nobr">Commitment\(_{\langle n\rangle}\)</span></em>
</p>

<ul>

<li>\(C_{\langle 1\rangle}xy(p)\) iff \(Cxy(p)\) and \(Cyx(p)\).</li>

<li> \(C_{\langle n+1\rangle}xy(p)\) iff \(C_{\langle
1\rangle}xy(C_{\langle n\rangle}xy(p))\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Now, if mutual commitment is defined as \(C_{\langle n\rangle}xy(p)\),
for all \(n\), the following theorems are derivable without much ado:
</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt id="theorem1">Theorem 1:</dt>
<dd>\(Cxy(p)\) and \(Cyx(p)\) iff \(x\) and \(y\) are mutually
committed to \(p\).</dd>
<dt id="theorem2">Theorem 2:</dt>
<dd>\(Cxy(p)\) iff \(x\) and \(y\) are mutually committed to
\(Cxy(p)\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#theorem1">Theorem 1</a>
 follows from the Acceptance principle alone and it says that shared
and mutual commitment coincide.
 <a href="#theorem2">Theorem 2</a>
 follows from Stacking and Acceptance; it says that \(x\) cannot have
a commitment to \(y\) unless \(x\) and \(y\) are mutually committed to
\(x\) having that commitment. In both cases, it is the Acceptance
principle that drives the recursion. Like its Lewisian cousin,
unbounded mutual commitment is immune to the issues that trouble its
mentalist counterparts
 (<a href="#UnboCommGrou">&sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
If common ground is defined in terms of individual attributes like
belief or reason to believe, then having such an attribute
doesn&rsquo;t entail that it is common ground that you have it, nor
does sharing the belief or a reason to believe that \(p\) entail that
\(p\) is common ground. The upshot of theorems 1 and 2 is that, when
defined as mutual commitment, common ground takes on an entirely
different aspect, owing to the fact that commitment is a relation
between individuals rather than an attribute of individuals.
Commitment sharing and common ground are the same thing; we just
cannot have commitments to one another without it being common ground
between us that we have
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Hence, in this framework, common ground and its constituents are much
closer connected than on other views. Common ground consists of
commitments and at the same time every commitment implies common
ground.</p>

<h3 id="Conc_1">4.3 Conclusion</h3>

<p>
In this section, we discussed two very different normative theories,
both of which contrast with mentalist theories in two related ways.
First, logical principles whose validity is questionable in a
mentalist setting are prima facie plausible in normative settings, and
second, normative theories allow common ground to be infinite, which
is problematic in a mentalist setting. The second difference may not
be such a big deal in itself, but both differences highlight the
contrast between mentalist and normative conceptions of pragmatics and
common ground.</p>

<p>
That said, mentalist and normative views are not necessarily at odds
with one another; in fact, as early as 1969, Lewis combined the two in
an integrated account of reasons to believe and belief formation,
thereby bringing together two modes of mutuality. In the upcoming
section, we will follow up on Lewis&rsquo;s pioneering work by
exploring the interconnections between commitments and beliefs.</p>

<h2 id="InclView">5. An Inclusive View</h2>

<p>
There are markedly different views on the nature of common ground.
According to some theories, common ground consists of mental states,
whereas others hold that its constitutive elements are normative
states. In the spirit of Lewis, I argue that these various accounts
are best viewed as being complementary rather than contrary. But to
say that they are complementary is much easier than saying how they
complement one another. Lewis proposed a partial answer to this
question by showing how (bounded) mutual beliefs may track (unbounded)
mutual reasons to believe
 (<a href="#ReasBeli">&sect;4.1</a>).
 The nexus between reasons to believe and beliefs is a matter of
individual rationality: if I have reason to believe that \(p\) and it
is relevant for me to decide whether or not to believe \(p\), then my
rational choice is to believe that \(p\). The nexus between
commitments and beliefs is more complex, because the normativity of
commitments is fundamentally different from that of reasons to
believe; most importantly, commitments are social relations rather
than individual attributes. A further complication is that, in
philosophy, the concept of belief has acquired a strong
epistemological bias, which it doesn&rsquo;t always have in everyday
life. It is the everyday notion of belief that we need, so we&rsquo;ll
start with that.</p>

<p>
Consider four statements that some people might be willing to endorse:
</p>

<ol id="statements">

<li id="state1">Mont Blanc is the tallest mountain of Western
Europe.</li>

<li id="state2">Sally&rsquo;s doll is in the basket.</li>

<li id="state3">Rembrandt was a great painter.</li>

<li id="state4">Dancing is a sin.</li>
</ol>

<p>
According to many philosophers, especially those with epistemological
agendas, these statements fall into two disjoint categories: whereas
 <a href="#state1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#state2">(2)</a>
 are made true or false by &ldquo;the facts&rdquo;,
 <a href="#state3">(3)</a>
 and
 <a href="#state4">(4)</a>
 merely express opinions. Those of us who cherish that distinction
will be inclined to hold that real beliefs are about facts, and
qualitatively different from opinions; reasons to believe will then be
treated accordingly. However, everyday usage is less discriminative:
<em>all</em> of
 <a href="#statements">(1-4)</a>
 are commonly said to be true or false and are equally accepted as
expressing the kind of things that people believe.</p>

<p>
Hence, our everyday notion of belief is broader than its philosophical
offshoot. In this respect, commitments agree with the former rather
than the latter. If construed as social relations that are meant to be
shared, commitments are not necessarily concerned with facts (though
of course they may serve in our pursuits of truth to the facts).
Therefore, all of
 <a href="#statements">(1-4)</a>
 express the kind of things that people may believe and may be
committed to. On this understanding of commitments and beliefs, let us
now consider how the two are connected. </p>

<ul>

<li> Obviously, belief doesn&rsquo;t imply commitment. All of us take
many things to be true without being committed to their truth to
anyone.</li>

<li> Shared belief doesn&rsquo;t imply shared commitment. Both of us
may believe \(p\) without being committed to \(p\) to one
another.</li>

<li> Mutual belief doesn&rsquo;t entail mutual commitment, but seems
to imply it by default. The case of the suggested bribe
 (<a href="#BuilBlocCommGrou">&sect;3.2</a>)
 is an exception. In this scenario the driver is patently suggesting a
bribe, but without being upfront about it, and it seems plausible that
this is an instance of mutual belief without mutual commitment.
However, cases like this are truly exceptional, and therefore they are
consistent with the idea that mutual belief implies mutual commitment
by default.</li>

<li> At first, it might seem that being committed to the truth of
\(p\) doesn&rsquo;t imply belief that \(p\), because people lie, and
lying is a familiar case of commitment without belief. However, this
too might be an exception that proves the rule. A more serious concern
is the following. If my commitments are closed under such logical
relations as entailment, stacking, and acceptance, then I have
infinitely many commitments. Unless I can have infinitely many
beliefs, which seems unlikely
 (<a href="#CaseAgaiUnboCommGrou">&sect;3.3.3</a>),
 I can form matching beliefs for a fraction of my commitments, at
best, and therefore it can&rsquo;t be true that commitment implies
belief by default. Note that the same objection could have been raised
against reasons to believe
 (<a href="#ReasBeli">&sect;4.1</a>).
 There the issue was quietly pre-empted by supposing that we try to
track with our beliefs only those reasons to believe that are of
practical relevance to us. If a similar proviso holds for commitments,
it is plausible that commitment implies belief by default.</li>

<li> With the same proviso, it may be argued that mutual commitment
implies mutual belief by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Admittedly, these arguments stand in need of further development, but
to the extent that they are sound, they invite the hypothesis that,
within certain practical limits, mutual belief and mutual commitment
tend to be concordant by default, notwithstanding the fact that
beliefs and commitments are fundamentally different things.</p>

<p>
Having discussed some of the ways different views on common ground may
hang together, let us now ask which one(s) are actually needed. The
short answer to that question is that only time will tell. I have a
longer answer, too, but it is more tentative. It starts with the
observation that, broadly speaking, there are two major approaches to
pragmatics, one mentalist, the other normative. These approaches are
associated with distinct views on common ground, and as several of
these views seem to be viable, we were led to surmise that some or all
of them are complementary. Now, it seems highly likely that mentalist
and normative approaches to pragmatics are complementary, too. To see
why, consider Fred&rsquo;s promise to Wilma one last time:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mow the lawn&rdquo;. It is agreed on all hands that,
in the normal run of things, Fred thereby conveys his intention to mow
the lawn <em>and</em> that he thereby commits himself to mowing the
lawn. Neither observation is controversial, but whereas mentalist
theories focus their attention on the former at the expense of the
latter, normative theories do the opposite. Clearly, some sort of
synthesis is called for, and once we have a unified framework, we will
also know which views on common ground matter most for pragmatics.</p>

<p>
To conclude this section, we return to the question raised at the
outset: what is common ground, and in particular, what distinguishes
it from mere information sharing? Despite the fact that there is no
consensus on what common ground is and several accounts seem viable,
all these accounts agree that mutuality is key. For they all define
common ground as &ldquo;mutual&#8198;&#8198;&hellip;&rdquo;, while
disagreeing on how the dots should be filled in. This agreement across
a range of otherwise very different accounts may seem remarkable, but
considering the kind of creatures that humans are, it shouldn&rsquo;t
be too surprising. We are an intensely social species with exceptional
cogitative powers, which enable us to relate to each other in complex
ways, including ways that are responsive to ways we relate to one
another. Recursive patterns are to be expected, and it shouldn&rsquo;t
come as a surprise that some special form of recursion has come to be
associated with various forms of sharing.</p>

<p>
However, even if mutuality is a feature of all modes of common ground,
it isn&rsquo;t restricted to common ground. For example, we can be
mutually happy that such-and-such is the case, where mutual happiness
is defined in the same way as bounded mutual belief: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(x\) and \(y\) are mutually happy that \(p\) iff \(x\) and \(y\) are
<span class="nobr">happy\(_{\langle n\rangle}\)</span> that \(p\), for
some small&nbsp;\(n\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Mutual happiness has the same logical structure as mutual belief, and
although it may be rarer, it can hardly be doubted that we are capable
of being mutually happy. But surely that doesn&rsquo;t make it a form
of common ground. Apparently, mutuality is a more general feature of
the human condition and not restricted to common ground.</p>

<h2 id="OutsFaceFaceSett">6. Outside Face-to-Face Settings</h2>

<p>
Even though language is used in myriad ways, it is widely agreed that
face-to-face discourse is the primal and predominant form of language
use (Clark 1996; Seyfarth &amp; Cheney 2018; Bavelas 2022). This
consensus is supported by several observations: face-to-face discourse
is a common practice in all human societies, it doesn&rsquo;t require
any special skills, and it is the setting in which children acquire
their first language (Clark 1996: 8&ndash;11). Moreover, face-to-face
communication is attested in many non-human species, which indicates
that it has deep evolutionary roots (Seyfarth &amp; Cheney 2018;
Geurts 2022).</p>

<p>
The paradigm of face-to-face discourse is a dyad who know each other
before the exchange starts, or at least are acquainted in the sense
that they are physically close during the exchange. Face-to-face
interlocutors share the same physical environment, can see and hear
each other without effort, and perceive each other&rsquo;s actions
instantaneously. As a rule, this is the kind of setting that pragmatic
theories are primarily concerned with, and it obviously excludes many
forms of language use: telephone calls, public speeches, classroom
teaching, email, newspaper articles, textbooks, novels, and so on. In
general, discussions of common ground are similarly restricted.</p>

<p>
According to Fillmore, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the language of face-to-face conversation is the basic and primary use
of language, all others being best described in terms of their manner
of deviation from that base. (1981: 152; cf. Clark 1996; Bavelas,
Hutchinson, Kenwood, &amp; Matheson 1997; Bavelas 2022) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Taking our lead from Fillmore, we will briefly touch on a number of
ways in which forms of language use deviate from the face-to-face
base, considering potential issues related to common ground as we
proceed. Since we are entering mostly uncharted territory, this
section is not about well-established problems and worked-out
solutions. Rather, it merely explores some issues that emerge when
language is used outside face-to-face settings.</p>

<p>
One of the leitmotifs in the following is acquaintance. Acquaintance
is a relation, or family of relations, between individuals, which has
qualitative as well as quantitative aspects. For example, Fred and
Barney know each other as middle-aged men, speakers of English,
neighbours, friends, colleagues, and football fans, and some of these
modes of acquaintance give them more to agree about than others.
Informally, the idea is that common ground co-varies with the ways in
which participants are acquainted with one another, both qualitatively
and quantitatively.</p>

<p>
More formally, acquaintance figures prominently in Semeijn&rsquo;s
(2021) discussion of various conceptions of common ground, which
hinges on the distinction between <em>de re</em> and <em>de dicto</em>
beliefs. Betty&rsquo;s belief that one of her colleagues is a thief is
<em>de re</em> if she has a particular colleague in mind whom she
believes to be a thief; it is <em>de dicto</em> if she merely believes
that there is a thief amongst her colleagues. With the help of this
distinction, Semeijn defines several notions of mutual belief,
adopting Kaplan&rsquo;s (1969) proposal that <em>de re</em> belief is
a special case of <em>de dicto</em> belief, which crucially involves
acquaintance: \(x\) has a <em>de re</em> belief about \(y\) if \(x\)
is acquainted with \(y\) as &ldquo;the <i>A</i>&rdquo;, for some
<i>A</i>, and \(x\) has a <em>de dicto</em> belief of the form
&ldquo;The <i>A</i> is such that&#8198;&hellip;&rdquo; Since the
<em>de re</em>/<em>de dicto</em> distinction is not confined to
beliefs, Semeijn&rsquo;s discussion carries over to mutual knowledge,
mutual acceptance, and mutual commitment.</p>

<p>
Physically speaking, face-to-face discourse consists of bursts of
sound and gesture which leave no material trace unless they are
recorded. Writing is a durable medium, which in evolutionary terms is
a recent technology that started to evolve a mere 5.000 years ago;
other durable media, like voice recordings, film, and video, are
significantly younger still. Durable media, but especially writing,
are a potent factor in enabling non-face-to-face exchanges, as several
of the following points will illustrate.</p>

<h3 id="BiggAudi">6.1 Bigger audiences</h3>

<p>
Size matters. Whereas the primal face-to-face setting involves two
participants, though a few more may be allowed for, a public
announcement in a football stadium may be heard by thousands of people
at once, and radio and television broadcasts reach even larger
audiences. In these settings, the sheer size of the audience makes it
a practical certainty that most members are unacquainted with most
others. As a consequence, there is bound to be less common ground than
in face-to-face discourse, and it is much harder for broadcasters and
their audiences to decide what can safely be taken to be common
ground. Indeed, the very notions of &ldquo;audience&rdquo; and
&ldquo;addressee&rdquo; become problematic. There may be a sense in
which a TV newsreader is speaking <em>to me</em>, provided I listen to
her and understand what she is saying; but clearly, this is a diluted
form of addressing compared to the <em>bona fide</em>, face-to-face
form.</p>

<h3 id="Anon">6.2 Anonymity</h3>

<p>
In face-to-face settings it is common ground who are the parties to
the exchange; if this is not a given, some parties are anonymous to
others, and common ground will be <em>de dicto</em> rather than <em>de
re</em>; for example, to the readers of an anonymous pamphlet the
author may be just &ldquo;whoever wrote this&rdquo; and his audience
may be just &ldquo;whoever reads this&rdquo;. While anonymity is
primarily associated with larger audiences, it is a feature of some
smaller settings, too. Semeijn (2021) discusses several cases, one of
which is anonymous fan mail. While the addressee of an anonymous fan
letter is known to the sender (though seldom personally), the sender
is anonymous. Compare this with a TV news report read by a famous
anchorperson, where it is the other way round. Other examples
discussed by Semeijn are double-blind reviews and messages in bottles.
In all these cases, at least one of the parties to the exchange is
unknown to at least some of the others, which not only makes it harder
to decide what is common ground between whom, but also prompts the
question in what sense there is common ground at all. For further
discussion of anonymity, see Goldberg (2013) and Marsili
(forthcoming).</p>

<h3 id="Asyn">6.3 Asynchrony</h3>

<p>
Although there will always elapse some time between speaking and
understanding, such delays are negligible in face-to-face discourse,
and are duly ignored by theories of common ground. However, outside
face-to-face settings, transmission latencies can become significantly
longer, and when they do they create hairy issues, both practical and
theoretical. For example, what (if anything) is the common ground
between myself and Darwin when I&rsquo;m reading his <em>Origin of
species</em>? Since Darwin doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, there cannot
be common ground between two extant individuals. However, since I can
believe in the present what Darwin believed in 1859, perhaps we can
have mutual beliefs across time. If so, my share of our mutual belief
might be <em>de re</em> (assuming that I&rsquo;m properly acquainted
with Darwin), while Darwin&rsquo;s would have to be <em>de dicto</em>.
Technically, it seems feasible to develop an asynchronous notion of
common ground in terms of mutual belief, though it remains to be seen
whether such a notion makes conceptual sense. Commitment is another
matter, for, even if it is obviously possible to have temporally
restricted commitments, it seems doubtful that Darwin in his time can
share commitments with me in mine, if commitment sharing is understood
as in
 <a href="#NormPragCommGrou">&sect;4.2</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="ReduInte">6.4 Reduced interactivity</h3>

<p>
According to the traditional picture of discourse, the hearer is a
more or less passive receptacle for information dispensed by the
speaker, which means that the communicative effort falls mainly on the
speaker; all the hearer has to do is understand what the speaker is
trying to say. However, this picture has been losing ground for quite
some time, and it is now widely, though by no means universally,
appreciated that face-to-face discourse is highly interactive (Clark
1996; Bavelas, Coates, &amp; Johnson 2000; Enfield 2017). Clark and
Wilkes-Gibbs (1986: 6) report the following exchange: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag15em indent">
<dt>A:</dt>
<dd>That tree has, uh, uh,&#8198;&hellip;</dd>
<dt>B:</dt>
<dd>tentworms.</dd>
<dt>A:</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>
<dt>B:</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Somewhat paradoxically (on the traditional view, that is), B&rsquo;s
first contribution is to help A making his statement. Then A says
&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; to acknowledge that he accepts B&rsquo;s help, and
only then does B respond. This case is not exceptional; as discussed
in
 <a href="#NormPragCommGrou">&sect;4.2</a>,
 addressees actively contribute to the discourse even as they
don&rsquo;t have the floor. This interactivity is essential, and it is
impaired and even lost entirely outside face-to-face dialogue. As a
consequence, the reader of a letter, for example, has a highly reduced
repertoire of responses to signal her understanding or lack thereof,
her agreement or disagreement, and so on. Moreover, her feedback will
necessarily arrive with a significant delay, if she is able and
willing to respond in the first place. In short, outside face-to-face
discourse, the basic mechanisms for establishing common ground are
curtailed to a large extent.</p>

<h3 id="LimiCommGrou">6.5 Limits of common ground</h3>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s sum up. First, even if an exact measure is not in the
offing, it seems safe to say that there is more common ground in some
situations than in others, and that, generally speaking, there is more
common ground within face-to-face contexts than without. Secondly,
outside face-to-face contexts there will often be more uncertainty
about what is common ground and what is not, and thirdly, in some such
contexts it may be doubtful that there is any common ground at all.
The last point may be less obvious than the first two, so let&rsquo;s
develop it a bit.</p>

<p>
All viable accounts of common ground reviewed in this entry rely on
the same form of mutuality, and I conjecture that, outside
face-to-face settings, this form isn&rsquo;t always achievable. To
support this conjecture, I propose to revisit the mentalist view on
common ground, and consider how an assertion may change the
interlocutors&rsquo; mutual beliefs, as discussed in
 <a href="#MentPragCommGrou">&sect;3.1</a>,
 but now in a scenario involving an anonymous pamphlet. Since, as we
defined it, the notion of mutual belief is atemporal, it needs to be
amended so as to accommodate the delay between the writing and reading
of a text. Let&rsquo;s agree that this can be done somehow and not
fret about the details.</p>

<p>
Suppose that \(y\) picks up a pamphlet which claims that \(p\), and
suppose furthermore that, unbeknown to \(y\), the pamphlet was written
by \(x\) at time \(t\), which was two years before it is read by \(y\)
at \(t'\). Then, in order for \(p\) to become mutual belief between
\(x\) at \(t\) and \(y\) at \(t'\), the following must be mutual
belief between \(x\) at \(t\) and \(y\) at \(t'\): </p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) believed \(p\) at \(t\) (i.e., it is mutual belief that
\(x\)&rsquo;s claim was sincere).</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>\(y\) believes \(p\) at \(t'\) (i.e., it is mutual belief that
\(y\) trusts \(x\)&rsquo;s claim to be true).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this case, a double-blind version of mutual belief is called for,
which allows two individuals to have beliefs about the other&rsquo;s
beliefs without having any idea who that other might be. How might
\(x\) and \(y\) be related to another in a way that enables each to
have beliefs about the other&rsquo;s beliefs? Does the mere fact that
one reads a text written by the other suffice as a basis for mutual
belief between the two? Wouldn&rsquo;t that make it too easy to have
mutual beliefs? Wouldn&rsquo;t it stretch the concept too far? It is
significantly less than obvious that the notion of double-blind mutual
belief is a viable one.</p>

<p>
Setting this general concern aside, let&rsquo;s ask ourselves what are
the odds that, at \(t'\), \(y\) believes that \(x\) believed \(p\) at
\(t\). Clearly, it depends on the details of the case. All that \(y\)
has to go by is the pamphlet. If its general content and \(p\) in
particular seem reasonable <em>by <i>y</i>&rsquo;s own lights</em>,
then she might come to believe that \(x\) believed \(p\) at \(t\); but
if \(y\) finds \(p\) dubious, she might be reluctant to believe that
\(x\) believed \(p\) at \(t\). Turning to \(x\), what are the odds
that, at \(t\), \(x\) believes that \(y\) will believe at \(t'\) that
\(x\) believed \(p\) at \(t\)? That depends on \(x\)&rsquo;s estimate
of how reasonable his pamphlet and \(p\) in particular are by
\(y\)&rsquo;s lights. But what could that estimate be based on, given
that \(x\) has no pertinent knowledge about \(y\)? So, even if we are
prepared to grant that double-blind mutual belief is viable, condition
(1) doesn&rsquo;t seem to be met; for similar reasons, the same holds
for condition (2). Therefore, while there seems to be some sense in
which \(x\) managed to communicate to \(y\) that \(p\), it is doubtful
that this feat involved mutual belief.</p>

<p>
The same kind of reasoning applies to other forms of mutuality, and in
each case the conclusion is the same: there are scenarios in which
linguistic communication seems to be possible without common ground.
This conclusion is not too surprising. After all, language is used in
such multifarious ways that it would be highly surprising if pragmatic
processes turned out to be the same throughout. In the foregoing, we
have been contrasting two quite disparate forms of communication:
real-time, face-to-face discourse versus a protracted sequence of
events to which the term &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; is marginally
applicable, at best. Small wonder that the recursive structures
associated with the former are not found with the latter.</p>

<p>
However, if correct, this conclusion provides food for a lot of
thought. Pragmatic theorising has come a long way using made-up
examples like this: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Pedro owns a donkey. He beats it.</p>
</div>

<p>
Even if it is unclear who Pedro might be, this fragment is
intelligible, and it <em>is</em> clear, for example, that the pronouns
&ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rdquo; likely refer to Pedro and his
donkey, respectively. How do we achieve sensible interpretations in
such cases without being able to rely on common ground in any of the
senses discussed in the foregoing? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m
sure that the issue concerns not only common ground, but pragmatics in
general.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
