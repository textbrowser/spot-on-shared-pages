<h1>Non-monotonic Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Dec 11, 2001; substantive revision Sat Nov 23, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
<em>Non-monotonic logic</em> (<em>NML</em>) is a family of formal
logics designed to model and better understand <em>defeasible
reasoning</em>. Reasoners draw conclusions in a defeasible manner when
they retain the right to retract these inferences upon the acquisition
of further information. Numerous instances can be found, ranging from
inductive generalizations to reasoning based on the best explanation,
as well as inferences grounded on expert opinion. Defeasible
inferences are prevalent in everyday reasoning, expert reasoning such
as medical diagnosis, and scientific reasoning. </p>

<p>

 <a href="../reasoning-defeasible/">Defeasible reasoning</a>
 can follow complex patterns, patterns that elude classical logic
(CL), intuitionistic logic (IL), or other monotonic logics that
characterize deductive reasoning. Monotonic logics are not designed
for and therefore do not allow for a retraction of inferences. A prime
objective within the domain of NML is to model defeasible reasoning
with a degree of formal precision and a normative grip, comparable to
what CL or IL furnish for mathematical reasoning. Alternatively, some
work in NML aims at providing descriptively adequate models of
defeasible inference. Formal precision is achieved by adopting formal
methods, such as proof-theoretic and semantic ones. In the context of
monotonic logics, the principle of truth-preservation, according to
which true premises lead to true conclusions, provides a normative
standard. Due to the possibility of the retraction, this standard is
violated in NMLs. Instead, NML aims at obtaining conclusions that, in
view of some premises, hold plausibly, likely, probably, or
stereotypically. Defeasible inference may follow different reasoning
styles, some of which are, for instance, more risk-taking than others.
Depending on the reasoning style, different principles for grounding a
normative framework for NMLs have been proposed in the literature.

<h2 id="DealDynaDefeReas">1. Dealing with the dynamics of defeasible reasoning</h2>

<p>
Defeasible reasoning is dynamic in that it allows for a retraction of
inferences. Take, for instance, reasoning on the basis of normality or
typicality assumptions. Although we infer that Tweety flies on the
basis of the information that Tweety is a bird and the background
knowledge that birds usually fly, we have good reasons to retract this
inference when learning that Tweety is a penguin or a kiwi. </p>

<p>
Another example is abductive reasoning
 (<a href="#Aliseda:2017">Aliseda 2017</a>).
 Given the observation that the streets are wet, we may infer the
explanation that it has been raining recently. However, recalling that
today the streets are cleaned and that the roof tops are dry, we will
retract this inference. </p>

<p>
As a last example, take probabilistic reasoning where we infer
&lsquo;<em>X</em> is a <em>B</em>&rsquo; from &lsquo;<em>X</em> is an
<em>A</em> and most <em>A</em>s are <em>B</em>s&rsquo;. Clearly, we
may learn that <em>X</em> is an exceptional <em>A</em> with respect to
being a <em>B</em>, and in view of this we retract our previous
inference. </p>

<p>
Our previous examples are instances of <em>ampliative</em> reasoning.
It is based on inferences for which the truth of the premises does not
guarantee or necessitate the truth of the conclusion, as in deductive
reasoning. Instead, the premises support the conclusion defeasibly,
e.g., the conclusion may hold in most/typical/etc. cases in which the
premises hold. </p>

<p>
Reasoning may also turn defeasible when applied to an inconsistent
stock of information, possibly obtained via different sources.
Classical logic is not a viable option in such situations, since it
allows us to derive any consequence. A more cautious approach is to
consider maximal consistent subsets (with respect to set inclusion) of
the given information
 (<a href="#Rescher:Manor:1970">Rescher and Manor 1970</a>).
 For instance, where \(p\), \(q\), and \(s\) are logical atoms and
\(\Gamma = \{ p \wedge q, \neg p \wedge q, s\}\), maximal consistent
subsets of \(\Gamma\) are \(\Gamma_1 = \{p \wedge q, s\}\) and
\(\Gamma_2 = \{\neg p \wedge q, s\}\). Various consequence relations
have been defined on the basis of consistent subsets. We give two
examples (see
 <a href="#Benferhat:et-al:1997">Benferhat et al. (1997)</a>
 for more). </p>

<p>
Let \(\Sigma\) be a possibly inconsistent set of formulas and let
\(\mathrm{MCS}(\Sigma)\) be the set of maximal consistent subsets of
\(\Sigma\). The set \(\mathrm{Free}(\Sigma)\) of <em>innocent
bystanders in \(\Sigma\)</em> is obtained by intersecting all members
of \(\mathrm{MCS}(\Sigma)\). </p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Free consequences</b>. \(\phi\) is a free consequence of
\(\Sigma\), denoted by \(\Sigma \nc_{\mathrm{free}} \phi\), if and
only if it is (classically) entailed by the set of all the innocent
bystanders \(\mathrm{Free}(\Sigma)\). </li>

<li> <b>Inevitable consequence</b>. \(\phi\) is an inevitable
consequence of \(\Sigma\), denoted by \(\Sigma \nc_{\mathrm{ie}}
\phi\), if and only if it is (classically) entailed by each member of
\(\mathrm{MCS}(\Sigma)\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
In our example, the innocent bystander \(s\) is both a free and
inevitable consequence, while \(q\) is merely an inevitable
consequence. In order to highlight the defeasible character of this
type of reasoning, consider the situation in which we obtain
additionally the information \(\neg s\). We now have the additional
two maximal consistent subsets \(\Gamma_{3} = \{p \wedge q, \neg s\}\)
and \(\Gamma_{4} = \{p \wedge \neg q, \neg s\}\) in view of which
\(s\) is neither a free nor an inevitable consequence. E.g., although
\(\Gamma \nc_{\mathrm{free}} s\) we have \(\Gamma \cup \{\neg s\}
\nnc_{\mathrm{free}} s\). </p>

<p>
This kind of dynamics is characteristic for non-monotonic logics, in
fact it is the reason for their name. They violate the Monotony
property, which holds for deductive reasoning, for instance, for the
relation of logical consequence \(\vDash\) of CL (see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-classical/">classical logic</a>
 for details on the relation \(\vDash\)): </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Monotony</b>: If \(\Sigma \nc \phi\) then also \(\Sigma \cup
\Sigma' \nc \phi\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Monotony states that consequence sets are robust under the addition of
information: If \(\phi\) is a consequence of \(\Sigma\) then it is
also a consequence of any set containing \(\Sigma\) as a subset. Most
of scholarly attention has been paid to the type of dynamics
underlying defeasible reasoning that results in violations of Montony
due to the retraction of inferences in view of conflicting new
information. It has been called the <em>synchronic</em>
 (<a href="#Pollock:2008">Pollock 2008</a>)
 or the <em>external dynamics</em>
 (<a href="#Batens:2004">Batens 2004</a>)
 of defeasible reasoning. </p>

<p>
Clearly, most forms of defeasible reasoning are externally dynamic and
hence most logics for defeasible reasoning violate Monotony: they have
non-monotonic consequence relations for which consequences may not
persist when new information is obtained. This feature is so central
that the formal logical study of defeasible reasoning is often taken
to be coextensive with the domain of NML where non-monotonicity is
understood as a property of the consequence relation of a logic. </p>

<p>
In addition to the external dynamic, defeasible reasoning also comes
with <em>diachronic</em>
 (<a href="#Pollock:2008">Pollock 2008</a>)
 or <em>internal</em> dynamics
 (<a href="#Batens:2004">Batens 2004</a>).
 This kind of dynamics occurs when inferences are retracted, not as a
result of obtaining new and defeating information, but if
inconsistencies are detected in the process of analyzing the already
available information. </p>

<p>
Let us return to non-monotonicity as a property of the consequence
relation. Given that Monotony is abandoned in NMLs, we are naturally
led to the question which formal properties are to replace Monotony
and whether some weakened forms of robustness of the consequence set
under the addition of new information is also to be expected in the
realm of defeasible reasoning. We state here two of the most central
properties considered in the literature. </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Cautious Monotony</b>: If \(\Sigma \nc \psi\) and \(\Sigma \nc
\phi\), then also \(\Sigma \cup \{\phi\} \nc \psi\). </li>

<li><b>Rational Monotony</b>: If \(\Sigma \nc \psi\) and \(\Sigma \nnc
\neg \phi\), then also \(\Sigma \cup \{\phi\} \nc \psi\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Both Cautious and Rational Monotony are restricted forms of Monotony.
</p>

<p>
Cautious Monotony is the converse of Cut: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Cut</b>: If \(\Sigma \nc \phi\) and \(\Sigma \cup \{\phi\} \nc
\psi\), then \(\Sigma \nc \psi\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Cautious Montony (resp. Cut) states that adding a consequence \(\phi\)
to the premise set \(\Sigma\) does not lead to any <em>decrease</em>
(resp. <em>increase</em>) in inferential power. Taken together, these
principles express that inference is a cumulative enterprise: we can
keep drawing consequences that can, in turn, be used as additional
premises, without affecting the set of conclusions. In
 <a href="#Gabbay:1985">Gabbay (1985)</a>
 it has been shown that some basic and intuitive assumptions about
non-monotonic derivations give rise to consequence relations which
satisfy Cautious Monotony, Cut and Reflexivity (If \(\phi \in \Sigma\)
then \(\Sigma \nc \phi\)). Consequently, these properties are commonly
taken to be central principles of
 NML.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Rational Monotony states that conclusions of \(\Sigma\) are not lost
when adding formulas \(\phi\) to \(\Sigma\) that are not contradicted
by \(\Sigma\). Rational Monotony is a more controversial property than
Cautious Monotony. For instance,
 <a href="#Stalnaker:1994">Stalnaker (1994)</a>
 gave a counter-example to it (see the
 <a href="suppl1.html">supplementary document</a>)
 in view of which it is clear that not in all application contexts
Rational Monotony is a desirable property of defeasible reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Weaker properties than Rational Monotony have been proposed, such as
Disjunctive Rationality
 (<a href="Makinson:1994">Makinson (1994)</a>).
 It states that \( \psi \) does not follow from \( \Sigma \cup \{
\phi_1 \vee \phi_2 \} \) if it neither follows from \( \Sigma \cup \{
\phi_1 \} \) nor from \( \Sigma \cup \{ \phi_2 \} \). We state the
contraposition formally: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Disjunctive Rationality</b>: If \( \Sigma \cup \{ \phi_1 \vee
\phi_2 \} \nc \psi \) then \( \Sigma \cup \{ \phi_1 \} \nc \psi \) or
\( \Sigma \cup \{ \phi_2 \} \nc \psi \). </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="DealConf">2. Dealing with conflicts</h2>

<p>
An intertwined yet distinct issue from the formal properties of a
non-monotonic consequence relation is handling <em>conflicts</em>
between potential defeasible conclusions. </p>

<p>
There are two types of conflict handling in defeasible reasoning. One
involves conflict resolution principles such as the Specificity
Principle or other measures of argument strength. The other deals with
irresolvable conflicts through Credulous and Skeptical reasoning
types. </p>

<h3 id="ConfReso">2.1 Conflict resolution</h3>

<p>
There are two different kinds of conflict that can arise in the
context of non-monotonic inference: (<em>i</em>) conflicts between
defeasible conclusions and &ldquo;hard facts,&rdquo; some of which are
possibly newly learned; and (<em>ii</em>) conflicts between defeasible
conclusions (many formalisms, for instance, provide some form of
defeasible inference rules, and such rules may have conflicting
conclusions). When a conflict (of either kind) arises, steps must be
taken to preserve or restore consistency. </p>

<p>
Conflicts of type (<em>i</em>) must be resolved in favor of the hard
facts by retracting the conflicting defeasible conclusion. More
interesting are mechanisms to resolve conflicts of type (<em>ii</em>).
In order to analyze these, we will make use of schematic inference
graphs (similar to the ones used in
 <a href="#InheNetwArguBaseAppr">Inheritance Networks</a>,
 see below). For instance, our previous example featuring the bird
Tweety is illustrated as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="tweety.png" alt="tweety.png" width="190" />
</blockquote>

<p>
We use the following conventions: double arrows signify deductive or
strict (i.e., nondefeasible) inferences, single arrows signify
defeasible inferences, and strikethrough arrows signify that the
negation of the pointed formula is implied. So, we can read the
diagram as follows: Penguins are birds (no exceptions); Birds usually
fly; and Penguins usually don&rsquo;t fly. </p>

<p>
We have a conflict between the following two arguments (where the
arguments are sequences of inferences): <em>Penguin</em>
\(\Rightarrow\) <em>Bird</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>flies</em>
(highlighted in blue) and <em>Penguin</em> \(\rightarrow\)
<em>not-flies</em> (highlighted in red). Both arguments include a
final defeasible inference. What is important to note is that a
penguin is a specific type of bird since <em>Penguin</em>
\(\Rightarrow\) <em>Bird</em> (while not <em>Bird</em> \(\Rightarrow\)
<em>Penguin</em>). According to the <em>Specificity Principle</em> an
inference with a more specific antecedent overrides a conflicting
defeasible inference with a less specific antecedent. Concerning the
penguin Tweety, we thus infer that she does not fly on the basis of
<em>Penguin</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>not-flies</em>. We resolve the
conflict in favor of the inference based on the more specific
information. </p>

<p>
Logicians distinguish between <em>strong</em> and <em>weak
specificity</em>: according to strong specificity \(A \not\rightarrow
C\) overrides \(A \Rightarrow B \rightarrow C\); according weak
specificity \(A \not\rightarrow C\) overrides \(A \rightarrow B
\rightarrow C\). Note that the difference concerns the nature of the
link between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>
A preference for one defeasible inference <em>A</em> \(\rightarrow\)
<em>B</em> over another conflicting one <em>C</em> \(\rightarrow\)
<em>D</em> may depend also on other factors. For example, in an
epistemic context we can compare the strengths of <em>A</em>
\(\rightarrow\) <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>D</em>
by appealing to the reliability of the source from which the
respective conditional knowledge originates. In the context of legal
reasoning, we may have the principles <em>lex superior</em> resp.
<em>lex posterior</em>, according to which the higher-ranked,
respectively, the later issued law dominates. </p>

<p>
Given a way to compare the strength of defeasible inference steps
using a preference relation \(\prec\), the question remains of how to
compare the strength of conflicting sequences of inferences (that is,
arguments). We give some examples. For a systematic survey and
classification of preference handling mechanisms in NML the interested
reader is referred to
 <a href="#Delgrande:et-al:2004">Delgrande et al. (2004)</a>
 and to
 <a href="#Beirlaen:et:al:2018">Beirlaen et al. (2018)</a>.
 </p>

<p>
According to the <em>Weakest Link Principle</em>
 (<a href="#Pollock:1991">Pollock 1991</a>)
 an argument is preferred over another conflicting argument if its
weakest defeasible link is stronger than the weakest defeasible link
in the conflicting argument. Take, for example, the situation in the
following figure: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="num-args.png" alt="num-args.png" width="400" />

<p>
On the left we see an inference graph with two conflicting arguments
(highlighted in blue and red). On the right we see the preference
ordering. The argument \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow E\) is stronger
than \(C \rightarrow D \not\rightarrow E\) since for its weakest link
\(D \not\rightarrow E\) we have \(D \not\rightarrow E \prec A
\rightarrow B\) and \(D \not\rightarrow E \prec B \rightarrow E\).
</p>

<p>
Another approach to preferences is procedural and greedy
 (<a href="#Liao:et:al:2018">Liao et al 2018</a>).
 Basically, it instructs to always apply the rule with the highest
priority first. (There may be various such rules with highest
priority, but for the sake of simplicity, we neglect this possibility
in what follows.) Consider the following example that is frequently
discussed in the literature. We have the rules </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="order-puzzle.png" alt="order-puzzle.png" width="100" />
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(A \rightarrow B \prec A \not\rightarrow C \prec B \rightarrow
C\) and we take \(A\) to be given. We can apply the defeasible rules
\(A \rightarrow B\) and \(A \not\rightarrow C\). If we operate in a
&ldquo;greedy&rdquo; way, we may apply \(A \not\rightarrow C\) to
derive \(C\) before applying \(A \rightarrow B\), since \(A
\rightarrow B \prec A \not\rightarrow C\). Now only \(A \rightarrow
B\) is applicable. So we derive \(B\). Although the antecedent of \(B
\rightarrow C\) is already derived, we cannot apply this rule for the
sake of consistency.
 <a href="#Brewka:Eiter:2000">Brewka and Eiter (2000)</a>
 argue against this greedy approach and in favor of deriving \(B\) and
\(C\).
 <a href="#Delgrande:Schaub:2000">Delgrande and Schaub (2000)</a>
 argue that the example presents an incoherent set of rules. This is
put into question in
 <a href="#Horty:2007">Horty (2007)</a>
 where a consistent deontic reading in terms of conditional
imperatives is presented which also challenges the procedural approach
by favoring the conclusions \(B\) and \(C\). </p>

<p>

 <a id="Ford"></a>
 <a href="#Ford:2004">Ford (2004)</a> pointed out that the order of strict and defeasible links
in arguments matters. For instance, she argues that an argument of the
form \(A \rightarrow B \Rightarrow D\) may be stronger than an
argument of the form \(A \Rightarrow C \not\rightarrow D\) (where \(A
\rightarrow B\) reads &ldquo;Most <em>A</em>s are <em>B</em>s&rdquo;
and \(A \Rightarrow C\) reads &ldquo;All <em>A</em>s are
<em>C</em>s.&rdquo;). The reason is that in the former case it is not
possible that no <em>A</em> is a <em>D</em> while in the second case
it is possible that no <em>A</em> is a not-<em>D</em>. This is
illustrated in the following figure:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="ford1.png" alt="ford1.png" width="150" />
<img src="ford2.png" alt="ford2.png" width="150" />
</blockquote>

<p>
The left diagram demonstrates that there are distributions such that
no <em>A</em>s are not-<em>D</em>s although \(A \Rightarrow C\) and
\(C \not\rightarrow D\) hold. The diagram on the right features a
distribution for \(A \rightarrow B \Rightarrow D\). Whenever the
extension of <em>A</em> is non-empty there will be <em>A</em>s that
are <em>D</em>s. </p>

<h3 id="ReasUnreConf">2.2 Reasoning with unresolved conflicts</h3>

<p>
We now discuss questions arising from conflicts that cannot be
resolved by any principle. Inferences can be drawn cautiously
(skeptical) or boldly (credulous). The skeptical and credulous
reasoning styles represent different interpretations of defeasible
knowledge and lead to different warranted conclusions. Both are
concerned with defeasible inferences that are acceptable to a rational
reasoner. While a credulous reasoner considers as consequences those
conclusions of inferences that are permissible for a rational reasoner
to hold, the skeptical reasoner considers those that a rational
reasoner must hold. </p>

<p>
To better understand this distinction, let us have a look at a
well-known example from the literature, the so-called &ldquo;Nixon
diamond,&rdquo;. Suppose that our knowledge base contains (defeasible)
information to the effect that a given individual, Nixon, is both a
Quaker and a Republican. Quakers, by and large, are pacifists, whereas
Republicans, by and large, are not. This is illustrated in the
following figure: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="nixon.png" alt="nixon.png" width="275" />
</blockquote>

<p>
The question is what defeasible conclusions are warranted on the basis
of this body of knowledge, and in particular whether we should infer
that Nixon is a pacifist or that he is not a pacifist. </p>

<p>
Neither the skeptical nor the credulous reasoner have logical grounds
to prefer either conclusion (&ldquo;Nixon is a pacifist&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Nixon is not a pacifist&rdquo;). While the credulous reasoner
accepts both conclusions, the skeptical reasoner refrains from either.
</p>

<p>
Since both conclusions are based on contested inferences, neither must
be accepted by a rational reasoner, which is why a skeptical reasoning
style refrains from both. From the perspective of credulous reasoning,
the conclusion according to which Nixon is a pacifist is acceptable,
since it is permissible for a rational reasoner to hold. It is
permissible since it can be defended from the counterargument based on
Nixon being a republican (highlighted in red). In order to defend it,
a rational reasoner refers to the fact that Nixon is also a Quaker
(the corresponding argument is highlighted in blue). (This is
particularly convincing, for a reasoner who considers being Quaker as
more diagnostic of being a Pacifist than being a Republican is of not
being a pacifist.) For the same reason, the conclusion that Nixon is
not a pacifist is credulously acceptable. </p>

<p>
A rationale behind the credulous reasoning type is to provide an
overview of possible conclusions given the conflicting defeasible
inferences in order to subsequently make a choice among them. This is
especially interesting in practical reasoning contexts in which the
choice determines a course of action and in which extralogical
considerations (based on preferences, values, etc.) further narrow
down the choice. </p>

<p>
In contrast, the rationale behind the skeptical reasoning type is to
determine uncontested defeasible conclusions. The purpose may be of a
more epistemological nature such as the updating of the agent&rsquo;s
belief or knowledge base with the chosen conclusions. </p>

<h3 id="SomeAdvaIssuForSkepReas">2.3 Some advanced issues for skeptical reasoning</h3>

<p>
We now discuss some further issues that arise in the context of
conflicting arguments. The first issue is illustrated in the following
figure: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="tweety-drowner.png" alt="tweety-drowner.png" width="200" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider the argument <em>Penguin</em> \(\Rightarrow\) <em>Bird</em>
\(\rightarrow\) <em>has wings</em> (highlighted in blue). Since
penguins do not fly, we know that penguins are exceptional birds, at
least with respect to the property of flying. A very cautious reasoner
may take this to be a reason to be skeptical about attributing other
typical properties of birds to penguins. NMLs that do not allow to
derive <em>has wings</em> are said to suffer from the <em>Drowning
Problem</em>
 <a id="drowning"></a>
 (<a href="#Benferhat:et:al:1993">Benferhat et al., 1993</a>). </p>

<p>
The question whether the exceptional status of <em>Penguin</em>
relative to <em>flies</em> should spread also to other typical
properties of <em>Bird</em> may depend on relevance relations among
these properties. For instance,
 <a href="#Koons:2017">Koons (2017)</a>
 proposes that causal relations play a role: whereas <em>has strong
forlimb muscles</em> is causally related to <em>flies</em> and hence
should not be attributed to penguins, the situation is different with
<em>is cold-blooded</em>. Similarly,
 <a href="#Pelletier:Elio:1994">Pelletier and Elio (1994)</a>
 argue that explanatory relations play a significant role in the way
in which reasoners treat exceptional information in non-monotonic
inference. </p>

<p>
Another much discussed issue (e.g.,
 <a href="#Ginsberg:1994">Ginsberg 1994</a>,
 <a href="#Makinson:Schlechta:1991">Makinson and Schlechta 1991</a>,
 <a href="#Horty:2002">Horty 2002</a>)
 concerns the question whether a conclusion that is derivable via
multiple conflicting arguments should be derived. Such conclusions are
called <em>Floating Conclusions</em>. The following figure illustrates
this with an extended version of the Nixon Diamond. </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="nixon-floating.png" alt="nixon-floating.png" width="275"/>
</blockquote>

<p>
The floating conclusion in question concerns <em>is political</em>. It
is derivable via the arguments <em>Nixon</em> \(\Rightarrow\)
<em>Quaker</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>Dove</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>is
political</em> (highlighted in blue) and via <em>Nixon</em>
\(\Rightarrow\) <em>Republican</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>Hawk</em>
\(\rightarrow\) <em>is political</em> (highlighted in red). Both
arguments are super-arguments of the conflicting <em>Nixon</em>
\(\Rightarrow\) <em>Quaker</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>Dove</em> and
<em>Nixon</em> \(\Rightarrow\) <em>Republican</em> \(\rightarrow\)
 <em>Hawk</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup><a href="#Horty:1994">Horty (1994)</a>
 argues that floating conclusions are acceptable in reasoning contexts
in which &ldquo;the value of drawing conclusions is high relative to
the costs involved if some of those conclusions turn out not to be
correct&rdquo; while they should be avoided &ldquo;when the cost of
error rises&rdquo; (p. 123). </p>

<p>
We conclude our discussion with so-called <em>Zombie-Arguments</em>
 (<a href="#Makinson:Schlechta:1991">Makinson and Schlechta 1991</a>,
 <a href="#Touretzky:et-al:1991">Touretzky et al. 1991</a>). Recall that a skeptical reasoner does not commit to a
conflicting argument.
 <a href="#Makinson:Schlechta:1991">Makinson and Schlechta (1991)</a>
 argue that super-arguments of such conflicted arguments
&mdash;although not acceptable&mdash; nevertheless still have the
power to undermine the commitment of a reasoner to an otherwise
unconflicted argument. We see an example in the following figure: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="zombie.png" alt="zombie.png" width="150"/>
</blockquote>

<p>
We observe two conflicting arguments concerning \(D\): \(A \rightarrow
B \rightarrow D\) and \(A \rightarrow C \not\rightarrow D\). Thus, we
have <em>ambiguous</em> information concerning \(D\). We observe
further, that \(F\) is a consequence of the (unconflicted) argument
\(A \rightarrow C \rightarrow E \rightarrow F\). It conflicts with the
zombie-argument \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \not\rightarrow F\)
(highlighted in red), which is a super-argument of the conflicted \(A
\rightarrow B \rightarrow D\). The name refers to undead beings since
an argument such as \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \not\rightarrow
F\) to which we have no commitment may still have the power to
influence our commitment to an otherwise unconflicted argument such as
\(A \rightarrow C \rightarrow E \rightarrow F\). In the literature we
can distinguish two approaches to such scenarios. In
<em>ambiguitiy-propagating</em> formalisms the ambiguity in \(D\)
propagates to \(F\), while in <em>ambiguity-blocking</em> formalisms
it does not and so \(F\) is considered a consequence in view of the
uncontested argument \(A \rightarrow C \rightarrow E \rightarrow F\)
 (<a href="#Stein:1992">Stein 1992</a>).
 </p>

<h2 id="NonMonoForm">3. Some Non-monotonic logics</h2>

<p>
Pioneering work in the field of NML began with the realization that CL
is inadequte to give a mathematically precise characterization of
defeasible reasoning. This insight was accompanied by the effort to
reproduce the success of CL in the representation of mathematical, or
formal, reasoning. Among the pioneers of the field in the late 1970s
were J. McCarthy, D. McDermott &amp; J. Doyle, and R. Reiter (see
 <a href="#Ginsberg:1987">Ginsberg (1987)</a>
 for a collection of early papers in the field and
 <a href="#Gabbay:et-al:1994">Gabbay et al. (1994)</a>
 for a collection of excellent survey papers). In 1980, the
<em>Artificial Intelligence Journal</em> published an issue (vol. 13,
1980) dedicated to these new formalisms, an event that has come to be
regarded as the &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; of NML. </p>

<p>
In this section an overview will be provided on some important systems
of NML. Since the evolutionary tree of NMLs has grown extraordinarily
rich, we will restrict the focus on presenting the basic ideas behind
some of the most influential and well-known approaches. </p>

<h3 id="ClosWorlAssu">3.1 The closed-world assumption</h3>

<p>
Since one of the goals of non-monotonic logic is to provide an
adequate account of defeasible reasoning, it is important to rely on a
rich supply of examples to guide and hone intuitions. Database theory
was one of the earliest sources of such examples, especially as
regards the <em>closed world assumption</em>. Suppose a travel agent
with access to a flight database needs to answer a client&rsquo;s
query about the best way to get from Oshkosh to Minsk. The agent
queries the database, finds not such entry, and responds that there
are no direct flights. How does the travel agent know this? </p>

<p>
Our agent&rsquo;s reasoning is based on the tacit assumption that the
database is <em>complete</em>, and that since the database does not
list any direct flights between the two cities, there are none. A
useful way to think about this process is as a kind of
<em>minimization</em>, i.e., an attempt to minimize the extension of
the predicate (&ldquo;flight-between,&rdquo; in this case). </p>

<p>
The idea of minimizing predicates is at the core of one of the
earliest non-monotonic formalisms, McCarthy&rsquo;s
<em>circumscription</em>
 (<a href="#McCarthy:1980">McCarthy 1980</a>).
 Circumscription makes explicit the intuition that, all other things
being equal, extensions of certain predicates should be
<em>minimal</em>. Consider principles such as &ldquo;all normal birds
fly&rdquo;. Implicit in this principle is the idea that specimens
should not be considered abnormal unless there is positive information
to that effect. McCarthy&rsquo;s idea was to represent this formally
using second-order logic (SOL). In SOL, in contrast to first-order
logic (FOL), it is allowed to explicitly quantify predicates, forming
sentences such as \(\exists P \forall x Px\) (&ldquo;there is a
universal predicate&rdquo;) or \(\forall P (Pa \equiv Pb)\)
(&ldquo;<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are indiscernible&rdquo;). </p>

<p>
In circumscription, given predicates <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>, we
abbreviate \(\forall x(Px \supset Qx)\) as \(P \le Q\); similarly, we
abbreviate \(P \le Q \wedge \neg(Q \le P)\) as \(P &lt; Q\). If
\(A(P)\) is a formula containing occurrences of a predicate
<em>P</em>, then the circumscription of <em>P</em> in <em>A</em> is
the second-order sentence \(A^{\star}(P)\): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(A(P) \wedge \neg\exists Q[A(Q) \wedge Q &lt; P]\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
\(A^{\star}(P)\) expresses that <em>P</em> satisfies <em>A</em>, and
that no smaller predicate does. Let \(Px\) be the predicate
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is abnormal,&rdquo; and let \(A(P)\) be the sentence
&ldquo;All birds that are not abnormal fly.&rdquo; Then the sentence
&ldquo;Tweety is a bird,&rdquo; together with \(A^{\star}(P)\) implies
&ldquo;Tweety flies,&rdquo; for the circumscription axiom forces the
extension of <em>P</em> to be empty, so that &ldquo;Tweety is
normal&rdquo; is automatically true. </p>

<p>
In terms of consequence relations, circumscription allows us to
define, for each predicate <em>P</em>, a non-monotonic relation \(A(P)
\nc \phi\) that holds precisely when \(A^{\star}(P) \vDash \phi\).
(This basic form of circumscription has been generalized to minimize a
predicate&rsquo;s extension while allowing others to vary.) From an
application perspective, circumscription presents a significant
computational limitation, inherent to the nature of the second-order
language (SOL) in which it is formulated (see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-higher-order/">Second-order and Higher-order Logic</a>
 for details). The issue with SOL, as opposed to first-order logic
(FOL), is the absence of a complete inference procedure: the cost of
the enhanced expressive capacity of SOL is the lack of complete
axiomatizations available in FOL. Consequently, it is impossible to
effectively enumerate all the validities of SOL, rendering the
determination of \(A(P) \nc \phi\) infeasible. </p>

<p>
Another influential mechanism realizing the closed world assumption is
<em>Negation as Failure</em>
 <a id="negation-as-failure"></a>
 (or <em>Default Negation</em>). It can nicely be explained if we take
a look at <em>Logic Programming</em>. A logic program consists of a
list of rules such as: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\tau ~~ \leftarrow ~~ \phi_1, \dotsc, \phi_n, \mathit{not}~ \psi_1,
\dotsc, \mathit{not}~ \psi_m\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In basic logic programs \(\tau\) is a logical atom and \(\phi_1,
\dotsc, \phi_n, \psi_1, \dotsc, \psi_m\) are logical literals (i.e.,
atoms or negated atoms). The logical form or rules in such programs
have been generalized in various ways (e.g.,
 <a href="#Alferes:et-al:1995">Alferes et al. 1995</a>)
 and many ways of interpreting rules have been proposed. To understand
the meaning of the default negation <em>not</em> we consider a
concrete example of a rule, namely: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>flies</em> \(~~\leftarrow~~\) <em>bird</em>, <em>not</em>
<em>penguin</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such rules read as expected, but with a small twist. As usual, the
rule licenses its conclusion if the formulas in the antecedent
(right-hand side) hold. The twist is that the falsity of (default)
negated formulas such as <em>penguin</em> need not be positively
established: Their falsity is assumed in the absence of a proof of the
opposite. In our example, if <em>penguin</em> cannot be proved then
<em>not penguin</em> is considered to hold (&ldquo;by default&rdquo;).
A logic program for our Tweety example may consist of the rule above
and </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>not-flies</em> \(~~\leftarrow~~\) <em>penguin</em>
<br />
<em>bird</em> \(~~\leftarrow~~\) <em>penguin</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose first all we know is <em>bird</em>. The latter two rules will
not be triggered. The first rule will be applicable: <em>bird</em>
is the case and we have no proof of <em>penguin</em> whence <em>not
penguin</em> is assumed. This allows us to infer <em>flies</em>. Now
suppose we know <em>penguin</em>. In this case, the first rule is not
applicable since the default negation of <em>penguin</em> is false,
but the latter two rules are triggered and we derive <em>bird</em> and
<em>not-flies</em>. </p>

<h3 id="InheNetwArguBaseAppr">3.2 Inheritance networks</h3>

<p>
In the context of a taxonomically organized body of knowledge, it is
natural to assume that subclasses inherit properties from their
superclasses: dogs have lungs because they are mammals and mammals
have lungs. However, there may be exceptions. For example, mammals, by
and large, do not fly; Since bats are mammals, in the absence of any
information to the contrary, we are justified in inferring that bats
do not fly. But if we learn that bats are exceptional mammals in that
they do fly, the conclusion that they do not fly is retracted, and the
conclusion that they fly is drawn instead. There are more complicated
scenarios. For example, baby bats are exceptional bats in that they do
not fly. Our example gives rise to potentially conflicting inferences.
When we infer that Stellaluna, being a baby bat, does not fly, we are
resolving all these potential conflicts based on the Specificity
Principle. </p>

<p>
<em>Non-monotonic inheritance networks</em> were developed for the
purpose of capturing taxonomic examples such as the one above. Such
networks are collections of nodes and directed
(&lsquo;<em>is-a</em>&rsquo;) links that represent taxonomic
information. When exceptions are allowed, the network is interpreted
<em>defeasibly</em>. The following figure gives a network representing
this state of affairs: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="inheritance.png" alt="inheritance.png" width="350"/>
</blockquote>

<p>
In such a network, links of the form \(A \rightarrow B\) represent the
fact that, typically and for the most part, <em>A</em>s are
<em>B</em>s, and therefore the information about <em>A</em>s is more
specific than the information about <em>B</em>s. More specific
information overrides more generic information. Research on
non-monotonic inheritance focuses on the different ways in which one
can make this idea precise. </p>

<p>
The main issue in defeasible inheritance is to characterize the set of
assertions that are supported by a given network. It is of course not
enough to devise a representational formalism; one also needs to
specify how the formalism is to be interpreted. This characterization
is accomplished through the notion of an <em>extension</em> of a given
network. There are two competing characterizations of extension, one
that follows the credulous strategy and one that follows the skeptical
one. Both utilize the notion of the <em>degree</em> of a path through
the network, defined as the length of the longest sequence of links
connecting its endpoints. Extensions are then constructed by
considering paths in ascending order of their degrees. The specifics
will not be detailed here, as many analogous issues are addressed in
the context of
 <a href="#DefaLogi">Default Logic</a>
 (discussed subsequently), with
 <a href="#Horty:1994">Horty (1994)</a>
 offering a comprehensive survey. It is also noteworthy that the
notion of degree is applicable solely to acyclic networks, thus posing
particular challenges when networks contain cycles (refer to
 <a href="#Antonelli:1997">Antonelli (1997)</a>
 for an analysis of inheritance in cyclic networks). </p>

<p>
Although the language of non-monotonic networks is limited by design
(in that only links of the form &lsquo;<em>is-a</em>&rsquo; &mdash;
and their negations &mdash; can be represented), such networks provide
a remarkably useful setting in which to test and refine one&rsquo;s
intuitions and methods for handling defeasible information. Such
intuitions and methods are then applied to more expressive formalisms.
</p>

<h3 id="ArgSec">3.3 Argument-based approaches</h3>

<p>
In <em>argument-based approaches</em> to defeasible reasoning the
notion of a path through an inheritance network is generalized to the
notion of an argument. Abstracting from the specifics and subtleties
of formalisms proposed in the
 literature<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>,
 an <em>argument</em> can be thought of in the following way. Given a
language \(\mathcal{L}\), a set of \(\mathcal{L}\)-formulas
\(\Gamma\), a set of strict rules <em>SRules</em> of the form
\(\phi_1, \dotsc, \phi_n \Rightarrow \psi\) (where \(\phi_i\) and
\(\psi\) are \(\mathcal{L}\)-formulas) and a set of defeasible rules
<em>DRules</em> of the form \(\phi_1, \dotsc, \phi_n \rightarrow
\psi\) (where \(\phi_i\) and \(\psi\) are \(\mathcal{L}\)-formulas) an
<em>argument</em> \((\Theta, \theta)\) <em>for</em> \(\tau\) is a
proof of \(\tau\) from some \(\Theta \subseteq \Gamma\) using the
rules in <em>SRules</em> and <em>DRules</em>. </p>

<p>
A central notion in argument-based approaches is an <em>argumentative
attack</em>. We can, for instance, distinguish between rebuts and
undercuts. A <em>rebut</em> of an argument \((\Theta, \tau)\) is an
argument that establishes that \(\tau\) is not the case. An
<em>undercut</em> of \((\Theta, \tau)\) establishes that \(\Theta\)
does not support \(\tau\). For instance, the argument that concludes
that an object is red from the fact that it looks red is undercut by
means of the observation that that object is illuminated by red light
 (<a href="#Pollock:1995">Pollock 1995</a>).
 Note that in order to undercut an argument for \(\tau\) one need not
establish that \(\tau\) does not hold. </p>

<p>
Argument-based approaches are based on the idea of argument
<em>acceptability</em>. In
 <a href="#Dung:1995">Dung (1995)</a>,
 an argument is acceptable if it can be defended against argumentative
attacks. This means that acceptability can be decided purely on the
basis of the attack relations between arguments, abstracting away from
the specific structure of the arguments themselves. It gives rise to a
two-phase methodology in which arguments and attacks are first
generated on the basis of a knowledge base, and then acceptability is
determined on the basis of the attack relation between arguments.
Given that <em>Args</em> represents the set of arguments generated
from \(\Gamma\) by the rules in <em>SRules</em> and <em>DRules</em>,
we define an attack relation \({\leadsto} \subseteq \mathit{Args}
\times \mathit{Args}\) as follows: \(a \leadsto b\) if and only if
\(a\) attacks (e.g., rebuts or undercuts) \(b\). This leads to the
formulation of a directed graph, termed the <em>argumentation
framework</em>, where the arguments are depicted as nodes, and the
arrows denote the attack relations. (Note that, at the graph level,
arguments are treated abstractly and their concrete structures are not
represented within the graph.) </p>

<p>
Various <em>argumentation semantics</em> have been proposed for
argumentation frameworks, specifying criteria for selecting sets of
arguments that represent stances of rational agents. Clearly, a
selected set of arguments \(S \subseteq \mathit{Args}\) should satisfy
the following requirements: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>\(S\) should be <em>conflict-free</em>, i.e., for all \(a, b \in
\mathit{Args}\), \(a\) does not attack \(b\). </li>

<li>\(S\) should be able to defend itself against all attackers. More
precisely, \(S\) is <em>admissible</em> if and only if \(S\) is
conflict-free and for every \(a \in \mathit{Args}\) that attacks some
\(b \in S\) there is a \(c \in S\) that attacks \(a\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
For instance, given the following graph, </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="abcd.png" alt="abcd.png" width="150" />
</blockquote>

<p>
\(\{a\}\) is admissible, while \(\{a,b\}\) is not conflict-free and
\(\{d\}\) is not admissible. </p>

<p>
Given these basic requirements, we can define, for instance, the
following semantics that is frequently adopted in the literature: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>A <em>preferred</em> set of arguments \(S\) is an admissible set
of arguments that is maximal in <em>Args</em> relative to
set-inclusion. </li>
</ul>

<p>
In our example, \(\{a,d\}\) and \(\{b,d\}\) are the two preferred
sets. This shows that the preferred semantics does not determine a
unique selection. In order to define a consequence relation, we can
proceed either according to the credulous rationale or according to
the skeptical rationale. Considering an abstract argumentation
framework based on \(\Gamma\), <em>SRules</em>, and <em>DRules</em>,
we give two examples of how a consequence set can be characterized by
means of the skeptical approach
 (<a href="#Prakken:2010">Prakken 2010</a>):
 </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li> \(\tau\) is a consequence if in each preferred set \(S\) of
arguments there is an argument <em>a</em> for \(\tau\). </li>

<li> \(\tau\) is a consequence if there is an argument <em>a</em> for
\(\tau\) that is in every preferred set of arguments \(S\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The second approach is more cautious. Intuitively, it demands that
there is a specific argument for \(\tau\) contained in each rational
stance that a reasoner can take given \(\Gamma\), <em>DRules</em>, and
<em>SRules</em>. The first option does not bind the acceptability of
\(\tau\) to a specific argument: it is sufficient if according to each
rational stance there is some argument for \(\tau\). </p>

<p>
Argumentation-based approaches have been considered a promising
unifying framework in NML
 (<a href="#Dung:1995">Dung 1995</a>).
 Many other systems of NML have been translated into logical
argumentation, such as approaches based on consistent subsets (see
 <a href="#Arieli:2019"> Arieli et al. 2019</a>
 for an overview) and approaches based on default logic
 (<a href="#Berkel:2024">van Berkel et al. 2024</a>)
 and its prioritized variants

<h3 id="DefaLogi">3.4 Default logic</h3>

<p>
In <em>Default Logic</em>, the main representational tool is that of a
<em>default rule</em>, or simply a <em>default</em>. A default is a
defeasible inference rule of the form </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\gamma: \theta) / \tau\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\gamma, \theta\), and \(\tau\) are sentences in a given
language, respectively called the <em>pre-requisite</em>, the
<em>justification</em> and the <em>conclusion</em> of the default. The
interpretation of the default is that if \(\gamma\) is known and there
is no evidence that \(\theta\) is false, then \(\tau\) can be
inferred. </p>

<p>
The application of a default rule should not result in inconsistency
with pre-existing beliefs. The complexity in satisfying this
consistency requirement arises from interactions among rules.
Specifically, the application of a certain rule may lead to the
failure of the consistency condition for another, possibly the same,
rule. For example, if \(\theta\) equals \(\neg\tau\), then applying
the rule could be considered self-defeating, as the application of the
rule itself leads to the failure of the consistency condition. </p>

<p>
Reiter&rsquo;s default logic
 (<a href="#Reiter:1980">Reiter 1980</a>)
 uses the notion of an <em>extension</em> to make precise the idea
that the consistency condition must be met both before and after the
rule is applied. Given a set \(\Delta\) of defaults, an extension for
\(\Delta\) represents a set of inferences that can be drawn
<em>reasonably</em> and <em>consistently</em> using defaults from
\(\Delta\). </p>

<p>
An extension is defined relative to a <em>default theory</em>. The
latter is a pair \((\Gamma, \Delta)\), where \(\Delta\) is a (finite)
set of defaults, and \(\Gamma\) is a set of sentences (a world
description). The idea is that \(\Gamma\) represents the strict or
background information, while \(\Delta\) specifies the available
defeasible information. We say that \(\Xi\) is an <em>extension</em>
for a default theory \((\Gamma, \Delta)\) if and only if </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Xi = \Xi_0 \cup \Xi_1 \cup \ldots \cup \Xi_n \cup \ldots\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\Xi_0 = \Gamma\), and </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Xi_{i+1} = \mathrm{Cn}(\Xi_i) \cup \bigl\{\tau \mid (\gamma :
\theta) / \tau \in \Delta \text{ where } \neg\theta \notin \Xi \text{
and } \gamma \in \Xi_i \bigr\}\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\mathrm{Cn}(\cdot)\) is the consequence relation of CL. It is
important to notice the occurrence of the limit \(\Xi\) in the
definition of \(\Xi_{i+1}\): the condition above is not a recursive
definition of the garden-variety, but a truly circular
characterization of extensions. </p>

<p>
This circularity can be made explicit by giving an equivalent
definition of extension as solution of fixed-point equations. Given a
default theory \((\Gamma, \Delta)\), let \(\mathsf{S}\) be an operator
defined on sets of sentences such that for any such set \(\Phi\),
\(\mathsf{S}(\Phi)\) is the smallest set that satisfies the following
three requirements: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>it contains \(\Gamma\) (\(\Gamma \subseteq \mathsf{S}(\Phi)\)),
</li>

<li>it is deductively closed (that is, if \(\mathsf{S}(\Phi) \vDash
\phi\) then \(\phi \in \mathsf{S}(\Phi)\)), </li>

<li>and it is closed under the default rules in \(\Delta\): whenever
for a default \((\gamma : \theta) / \tau \in \Delta\) both \(\gamma
\in \mathsf{S}(\Phi)\) and \(\neg\theta \notin \Phi\), then \(\tau \in
\mathsf{S}(\Phi)\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
It can be shown that \(\Xi\) is an extension of \((\Gamma,\Delta)\) if
and only if \(\Theta\) is a fixed-point of \(\mathsf{S}\), that is, if
\(\mathsf{S}(\Xi) = \Xi\). </p>

<p>
Neither one of the two characterizations of extension for default
logic (i.e. the fixpoint definition and the pseudo-iterative one)
provides a way to &ldquo;construct&rdquo; extensions by means of an
iterative process. Essentially, one has to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; a set
of sentences \(\Xi\), and then verify that it satisfies the definition
of an extension. </p>

<p>
For any given default theory, extensions need not exist, and even when
they exist, they need not be unique. We start with an example of the
former situation. Let \(\Gamma = \emptyset\) and let \(\Delta\)
comprise the single
 default<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\top : \theta) / \neg \theta\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If \(\Xi\) were an extension, then the justification \(\theta\) of the
default above would be consistent with \(\Xi\) or not, and either case
is impossible. For if \(\theta\) were consistent with \(\Xi\), then
the default would be applied to derive \(\neg\theta\) in contradiction
the consistency of \(\Xi\) with \(\theta\). Similarly, if \(\Xi\) were
inconsistent with \(\theta\) then \(\Xi \vDash \neg \theta\) and
hence, by deductive closure, \(\neg\theta \in \Theta\). Our default
would not be applicable, in which case \(\Xi = \Xi_1 =
\mathrm{Cn}(\emptyset)\). But then \(\neg\theta \notin \Xi\),&mdash;a
contradiction. </p>

<p>
For normal default theories that only consist of <em>normal
defaults</em>, that is, defaults of the form \((\gamma : \theta) /
\theta\), extensions always exist. </p>

<p>

 <a href="#Lukaszewicz:1988">Lukaszewicz (1988)</a>
 presents a modified definition of extension that avoids the previous
two problems: it is defined in an iterative way and it warrants the
existence of an extension. In a nutshell, the idea is to keep track of
the justifications used in the procedure. A default is applied in case
its precondition is implied by the current beliefs and its conclusion
is consistent with the given beliefs, its own justification, and each
of the justifications of previously applied defaults. Additionally,
for normal theories, Lukaszewicz&rsquo;s definition of extensions is
equivalent to the definitions from above. </p>

<p>
Let us now consider an example of a default theory with multiple
extensions. Let \(\Gamma = \emptyset\), and suppose that \(\Delta\)
comprises the following two defaults </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\top : \theta) / \neg\tau\) and \((\top: \tau)/\neg\theta\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This theory has exactly two extensions, one in which the first default
is applied and one in which the second one is applied. It is easy to
see that at least one default has to be applied in any extension and
that both defaults cannot be applied in the same extension. </p>

<p>
The fact that default theories can have zero, one, or multiple
extensions raises the issue of what inferences one is justified in
drawing from a given default theory. The problem can be presented as
follows: Given a default theory \((\Gamma, \Delta)\), what sentences
can be regarded as <em>defeasible consequences</em> of the theory?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it may be useful to map out all the consequences that can be
drawn from <em>all</em> the extensions, for instance, in order to
identify extensions that give rise to undesired consequences (in view
of extralogical considerations). The credulous approach does just
that: \((\Gamma, \Delta) \nc \phi\) if and only if \(\phi\) belongs to
<em>any</em> extension of the theory. Note that, in case of multiple
extensions the credulous consequence set will not be closed under CL
and it may be inconsistent. </p>

<p>
Alternatively, one can adopt the skeptical strategy according to which
\((\Gamma, \Delta) \nc \phi\) if and only if \(\phi\) is contained in
<em>every</em> extension of \((\Gamma, \Delta)\). </p>

<p>
Skeptical consequence, as based on Reiter&rsquo;s notion of extension,
fails to be cautiously monotonic
 (<a href="#Makinson:1994">Makinson 1994</a>).
 To see this, consider the default theory \((\emptyset, \Delta)\),
where \(\Delta\) comprises the following two defaults: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\top: \theta)/\theta\) and \((\theta \vee \gamma : \neg \theta) /
\neg \theta\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This theory has only one extension, coinciding with the deductive
closure of \(\{\theta\}\). Hence, according to skeptical consequence
we have \((\emptyset, \Delta) \nc \theta\), as well as \((\emptyset,
\Delta) \nc \theta \vee \gamma\) (by the deductive closure of
extensions). </p>

<p>
Now consider the theory \((\{\theta \vee \gamma\}, \Delta)\). It has
two extensions: one is the same as before, but also another one
coinciding with the deductive closure of \(\{\neg\theta\}\), and hence
not containing \(\theta\). It follows that the intersection of the
extensions no longer contains \(\theta\), so that \((\{\theta \vee
\gamma\}, \Delta) \nc \theta\) <em>fails</em>, against Cautious
Monotony. (Notice that the same example establishes a counter-example
for Cut for the credulous strategy: for this we consider the extension
of \((\{\theta \vee \gamma\}, \Delta)\) that contains \(\neg\theta\).)
</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#Antonelli:1999">Antonelli (1999)</a>
 a notion of <em>general extension</em> for default logic is
introduced, showing that this notion yields a well-behaved relation of
defeasible consequence \(\nc\) that satisfies Supraclassicality (if
\(\Gamma \vDash \phi\) then \(\Gamma \nc \phi\)) and the three central
requirements for NMLs Reflexivity, Cut, and Cautious Monotony from
 <a href="#Gabbay:1985">Gabbay (1985)</a>.
 The idea behind general extensions can be explained in a particularly
simple way in the case of <em>pre-requisite free</em> default theories
(called &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; in <em>Antonelli (1999)</em>). A
general extension for such a default theory is a <em>pair</em>
\((\Gamma^+, \Gamma^-)\) of sets of defaults (or conclusions thereof)
that simultaneously satisfies <em>two</em> fixed-point equations. The
set \(\Gamma^+\) comprises (conclusions of) defaults that are
explicitly triggered, and the set \(\Gamma^-\) comprises (conclusions
of) defaults that are explicitly ruled out. The intuition is that
defaults that are not ruled out can still prevent other defaults from
being triggered (although they might not be triggered themselves). We
thus obtain a &ldquo;3-valued&rdquo; approach (not unlike that of
Kripke&rsquo;s theory of truth
 (<a href="#Kripke:1975">Kripke 1975</a>)),
 in virtue of which general extensions are now endowed with a
non-trivial (i.e., not &ldquo;flat&rdquo;) algebraic structure. It is
then possible to pick out, in a principled way, a particular general
extension (for instance, the unique least one, which is always
guaranteed to exist) on which to base a notion of defeasible
consequence. </p>

<p>
A different set of issues arises in connection with the behavior of
default logic from the point of view of computation. For a given
semi-decidable set \(\Phi\) of sentences, the set of all \(\phi\) that
are a consequence of \(\Phi\) in FOL is itself semi-decidable (see the
entry on
 <a href="../computability/">computability and complexity</a>).
 In the case of default logic, to formulate the corresponding problem
one extends (in the obvious way) the notion of (semi-)decidability to
sets of defaults. The problem, then, is to decide, given a default
theory \((\Gamma,\Delta)\) and a sentence &phi; whether
\((\Gamma,\Delta) \nc \phi\), where \(\nc\) is defined, say,
skeptically. Such a problem is not even semi-decidable, since, in
order to determine whether a default is triggered by a pair of sets of
sentences, one has to perform a consistency check, and such checks are
not computable. </p>

<p>
Default logic as defined above does not prioritize among defaults. In
 <a href="#Poole:1985">Poole (1985)</a>
 we find an approach in which the Specificity Principle is considered.
In
 <a href="#Horty:2007">Horty (2007)</a>
 defaults are ordered by a strict partial order \(\prec\) where
\((\gamma : \theta)/\tau \prec (\gamma' : \theta') / \tau'\) means
that \((\gamma' : \theta') / \tau'\) has priority over \((\gamma :
\theta) / \tau\). The ordering \(\prec\) may express &mdash;depending
on the application&mdash; specificity relations, the comparative
reliability of the conditional knowledge expressed by defaults, etc.
An <em>ordered default theory</em> is then a triple \((\Gamma, \Delta,
\prec)\) where \((\Gamma, \Delta)\) is a default theory. We give an
example, but omit a more technical explanation. Take \(\Gamma\) =
{<em>bird</em>, <em>penguin</em>}, \(\Delta\) = {<em>bird</em>
\(\rightarrow\) <em>flies</em>, <em>penguin</em> \(\rightarrow\)
&not;<em>flies</em>} and <em>bird</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>flies</em>
\(\prec\) <em>penguin</em> \(\rightarrow\) &not;<em>flies</em>, where
\(\phi \rightarrow \psi\) represents the normal default \((\phi: \psi)
/ \psi\). We have two extensions of \((\Gamma,\Delta)\), one in which
<em>bird</em> \(\rightarrow\) <em>flies</em> is applied and one in
which <em>penguin</em> \(\rightarrow\) &not;<em>flies</em> is applied.
Since the latter default is \(\prec\)-preferred over the former, only
the latter extension is an extension of \((\Gamma,\Delta,\prec)\).
</p>

<h3 id="AutoLogi">3.5 Autoepistemic logic</h3>

<p>
An NML closely related to default logic is Moore&rsquo;s
<em>Autoepistemic Logic</em>
 (<a href="#Moore:1985">Moore 1985</a>).
 It models the reasoning of an ideal agent reflecting on her own
beliefs. For instance, sometimes the absence of a belief in \(\phi\)
may give an agent a reason to infer \(\neg\phi\). Moore gives the
following example: If I had an older brother, I would know about it.
Since I do not, I believe not to have an older brother. </p>

<p>
An autoepistemic theory consists of the beliefs of an agent including
her reflective beliefs about her beliefs. For the latter an
autoepistemic belief operator \(\mathsf{B}\) is used. In our example
such a theory may contain \(\neg \mathsf{B} \mathit{brother} \supset
\neg \mathit{brother}\). Autoepistemic logic specifies ideal
properties of such theories. Following
 <a href="#Stalnaker:1993">Stalnaker (1993)</a>,
 an autoepistemic theory \(\Gamma\) should be <em>stable</em>: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>\(\Gamma\) should be closed under classical logic: if \(\Gamma
\vDash \phi\) then \(\phi \in \Gamma\); </li>

<li>\(\Gamma\) should be introspectively adequate:

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>if \(\phi \in \Gamma\) then \(\mathsf{B}\phi \in \Gamma\); </li>

<li>if \(\phi \notin \Gamma\) then \(\neg \mathsf{B} \phi \in
\Gamma\). </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>

<p>
If \(\Gamma\) is consistent, stability implies that </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li> \(\phi \in \Gamma\) if and only if \(\mathsf{B} \phi \in
\Gamma\), and </li>

<li> \(\phi \notin \Gamma\) if and only if \(\neg \mathsf{B} \phi \in
\Gamma\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Let us, for instance, consider the two types of consistent stable sets
that extend \(\Xi_1 = \{ \neg \mathsf{B} \mathit{brother} \supset \neg
\mathit{brother} \}\): </p>

<ol class="org-ol">

<li> \(\Gamma_1\) for which \(\mathit{brother} \in \Gamma_1\) and also
by introspection \(\mathsf{B} \mathit{brother} \in \Gamma_1\). </li>

<li> \(\Gamma_2\) for which \(\mathit{brother} \notin \Gamma_2\).
Hence, \(\neg \mathsf{B} \mathit{brother} \in \Gamma_2\) and by
closure, \(\neg \mathit{brother} \in \Gamma_2\). Thus, by
introspection also \(\mathsf{B}\neg \mathit{brother} \in \Gamma_2\).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second option seems more intuitive since given only \(\neg
\mathsf{B} \mathit{brother} \supset \neg \mathit{brother}\) the belief
in \(\mathit{brother}\) seems intuitively speaking ungrounded in the
context of \(\Xi_1\). To make this formally precise, Moore defines
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li> \(\Gamma\) is <em>grounded in a set of assumptions \(\Xi\)</em>
if for each \(\psi \in \Gamma\), \(\Xi \cup \{ \mathsf{B}\phi \mid
\phi \in \Gamma\} \cup \{\neg \mathsf{B}\phi \mid \phi \notin \Gamma\}
\vDash \psi\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Stable theories that are grounded in a set of assumptions \(\Xi\) are
called <em>stable expansions of \(\Xi\)</em> or <em>autoepistemic
extensions of \(\Xi\)</em>. Stable expansions \(\Gamma\) of \(\Xi\)
can equivalently be characterized as fixed points: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Gamma = \mathrm{Cn}\bigl( \Xi \cup \{ \mathsf{B}\phi \mid \phi \in
\Gamma\} \cup \{\neg \mathsf{B} \phi \mid \phi \notin \Gamma\}\bigr)\)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\mathrm{Cn}(\cdot)\) is the consequence function of CL. </p>

<p>
There is no stable theory that is grounded in \(\Xi_1\) and that
contains \(\mathit{brother}\) and / or \(\mathsf{B} \mathit{brother}\)
like our \(\Gamma_1\) above. The reason is that we fail to derive
\(\mathit{brother}\) from \(\Xi_1 \cup \{\mathsf{B} \psi \mid \psi \in
\Gamma_1\} \cup \{\neg \mathsf{B} \psi \mid \psi \notin \Gamma_1\}\).
The only stable extension of \(\Xi_1\) contains \(\neg \mathsf{B}
\mathit{brother}\) and \(\neg \mathit{brother}\). </p>

<p>
Just as in default logic, in autoepistemic logic some sets of
assumptions have no stable extensions while some have multiple stable
extensions. We demonstrate the former case with \(\Xi_2 = \{\neg
\mathsf{B} \phi \supset \phi\}\). Suppose there is a stable extension
\(\Gamma\) of \(\Xi_2\). First note that there is no way to ground
\(\phi\) in view of \(\Xi_2\). Hence \(\phi \notin \Gamma\) which
means that \(\neg \mathsf{B} \phi \in \Gamma\). But then \(\phi \in
\Gamma\) by modus ponens which is a contradiction. </p>

<p>
A potentially problematic property of Moore&rsquo;s notion of
groundedness is that it allows for a type of epistemic bootstrapping.
Take \(\Xi_3 = \{\mathsf{B}\phi \supset \phi\}\). Suppose that an
agent adopts the belief that she believes \(\phi\), i.e.
\(\mathsf{B}\phi\). Now she can use \(\mathsf{B}\phi \supset \phi\) to
derive \(\phi\). Hence, on the basis of \(\Xi_3\) she can ground her
belief in \(\phi\) on her belief that she believes \(\phi\). In fact,
there is a stable extension of \(\Xi_3\) that contains \(\phi\) and
\(\mathsf{B} \phi\). In view of this, weaker forms of groundedness
have been proposed in
 <a href="#Konolige:1988">Konolige (1988)</a>
 that do not allow for this form of bootstrapping and according to
which we only have the extension of \(\Xi_3\) that contains neither
\(\phi\) nor \(\mathsf{B}\phi\). </p>

<p>
The centrality of autoepistemic logic in NML is emphasized by the fact
that several tight links to other seminal NMLs have been established.
Let us mention three such links. </p>

<p>
First, there are close connections between autoepistemic logic and
logic programming. For instance, Gelfond&rsquo;s and Lifschitz&rsquo;s
stable model semantics for logic programming with
 <a href="#negation-as-failure">negation as failure</a>
 which serves as the foundation for the answer set programming
paradigm in computer science has been equivalently expressed by means
of autoepistemic logic
 (<a href="#Gelfond:Lifschitz:1988">Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988</a>).
 The result is achieved by translating clauses in logic programming
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\phi ~~ \leftarrow ~~ \phi_1, \dotsc, \phi_n, \mathit{not}~\psi_1,
\dotsc, \mathit{not}~\psi_m\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
in such a way that negation as failure (\(\mathit{not}~\psi\)) gets
the meaning &ldquo;it is not believed that \(\psi\)&rdquo; (\(\neg
\mathsf{B}\psi\)): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\phi_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \phi_{n} \wedge \neg \mathsf{B} \psi_1
\wedge \ldots \wedge \neg \mathsf{B} \psi_m) \supset \psi\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A second link has been established in
 <a href="#Konolige:1988">Konolige (1988)</a>
 with default logic which has been shown translatable to and
equi-expressive with Konolige&rsquo;s strongly grounded variant of
autoepistemic logic. Default rules \((\gamma : \theta) / \tau\) are
translated by interpreting consistency conditions \(\theta\) by \(\neg
\mathsf{B} \neg \theta\) which can be read as &ldquo;\(\theta\) is
consistent with the given beliefs&rdquo;: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\mathsf{B} \gamma \wedge \neg \mathsf{B} \neg \theta) \supset
\tau\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Especially the latter link is rather remarkable since the subject
matter of the given formalisms is quite different. While default logic
deals with defeasible rules, i.e. rules that allow for exceptions
(such as &lsquo;Birds fly&rsquo;), the non-monotonicity of
autoepistemic logic is rooted in the indexicality of its autoepistemic
belief operator
 (<a href="#Moore:1984">Moore 1984</a>,
 <a href="#Konolige:1988">Konolige 1988</a>): it refers to the autoepistemic theory into which it is
embeded, and hence its meaning may change when we add beliefs to the
theory. </p>

<p>
Various modal semantics have been proposed for autoepistemic logic
(see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>
 for more background on modal logics). For instance,
 <a href="#Moore:1984">Moore (1984)</a>
 proposes an S5-based Kripkean possible world semantics and
 <a href="#Lin:Shoham:1990">Lin and Shoham (1990)</a>
 propose bi-modal preferential semantics (see Section
 <a href="#SeleSema">Selection semantics</a>
 below) for both autoepistemic logic and default logic. In
 <a href="#Konolige:1988">Konolige (1988)</a>
 it has been observed that the fixed point characterization of stable
expansions can be alternatively phrased only on the basis of the set
of formulas \(\Gamma_0\) in \(\Gamma\) that do not contain occurrences
of the modal operator \(\mathsf{B}\): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\( \Gamma = \mathrm{Cn}_{\mathsf{K45}}\bigl( \Xi \cup \{
\mathsf{B}\phi \mid \phi \in \Gamma_0\} \cup \{\neg \mathsf{B}\phi
\mid \phi \notin \Gamma_0\}\bigr)\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\mathrm{Cn}_{\mathsf{K45}}(\cdot)\) is the consequence
function of the modal logic \(\mathsf{K45}\). </p>

<h3 id="SeleSema">3.6 Selection semantics</h3>

<p>
In CL a formula \(\phi\) is entailed by \(\Gamma\) (in signs \(\Gamma
\vDash \phi\)) if and only if \(\phi\) is valid in all classical
models of \(\Gamma\). An influential idea in NML is to define
non-monotonic entailment not in terms of <em>all</em> classical models
of \(\Gamma\), but rather in terms of a <em>selection</em> of these
models
 (<a href="#Shoham:1987">Shoham 1987</a>).
 Intuitively, the idea is to read </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Gamma \nc \phi\) as &ldquo;\(\phi\) holds in the most
normal/natural/etc. models of \(\Gamma\).&rdquo; </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>3.6.1 The core properties</h4>

<p>
In the seminal paper
 <a href="#Kraus:et-al:1990">Kraus et al. (1990)</a>
 this idea is investigated systematically. The authors introduce
various semantic structures, among them preferential ones. A
<em>preferential structure</em> \(S\) consists of </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>a set \(\Omega\) of states </li>

<li>and an irreflexive and transitive relation \(\prec\) on
\(\Omega\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the context of preferential structures one may think of states in
terms of labelled models \(M_s\) of classical propositional logic,
where each label \(s\) is attached to a unique model \(M\) but a model
may occur under various labels in
 \(\Omega\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 For the ease of demonstration we will henceforth just talk about
&lsquo;models in \(\Omega\)&rsquo; and not anymore refer to states or
labelled models. </p>

<p>
Intuitively, \(M \prec M'\) if \(M\) is more normal than \(M'\). The
relation \(\prec\) can be employed to formally realize the idea of
defining a consequence relation in view of the most normal models,
namely by focusing on \(\prec\)-minimal models. Formally, where
\([\psi]\) is the set of all models of \(\psi\) in \(\Omega\),
\(\nc^S\), is defined as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\psi \nc^S \phi\) if and only if \(\phi\) holds in all
\(\prec\)-minimal models in \([\psi]\). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In order to warrant that there are such minimal states, \(\prec\) is
considered to be <em>smooth</em> (also sometimes called
<em>stuttered</em>), i.e., for each \(M\) either \(M\) is
\(\prec\)-minimal or there is a \(\prec\)-minimal \(M'\) such that
\(M' \prec M\). </p>

<p>
Preferential structures enjoy a central role in NML since they
characterize <em>preferential consequence relations</em>, i.e.,
non-monotonic consequence relations \(\nc\) that fulfill the following
central properties, also referred to as the <em>core properties</em>
or the <em>conservative core</em> of non-monotonic reasoning systems
or as the <em>KLM-properties</em> (in reference to the authors of
 <a href="#Kraus:et-al:1990">Kraus, Lehmann, Magidor 1990</a>):
 </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Reflexivity</b>: \(\phi \nc \phi\). </li>

<li><b>Cut</b>: If \(\phi \wedge \psi \nc \tau\) and \(\phi \nc
\psi\), then \(\phi \nc \tau\). </li>

<li><b>Cautious Monotony</b>: If \(\phi \nc \psi\) and \(\phi \nc
\tau\) then \(\phi \wedge \psi \nc \tau\). </li>

<li><b>Left Logical Equivalence</b>: If \(\vDash \phi \equiv \psi\)
and \(\phi \nc \tau\), then \(\psi \nc \tau\). </li>

<li><b>Right Weakening</b>: If \(\vDash \phi \supset \psi\) and \(\tau
\nc \phi\), then \(\tau\nc \psi\). </li>

<li><b>OR</b>: If \(\phi \nc \psi\) and \(\tau \nc \psi\), then \(\phi
\vee \tau \nc \psi\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The former three properties are those we have already seen above.
According to Left Logical Equivalence, classically equivalent formulas
have the same non-monotonic consequences. Where \(\psi\) is
classically entailed by \(\phi\), Right Weakening expresses that
whenever \(\phi\) is a non-monotonic consequence of \(\tau\) then so
is \(\psi\). </p>

<p>
Without further commentary we state two important derived rules: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>AND</b>: If \(\phi \nc \psi\) and \(\phi \nc \tau\) then \(\phi
\nc \psi \wedge \tau\). </li>

<li><b>S</b>: If \(\phi \wedge \psi \nc \tau\) then \(\phi \nc \psi
\supset \tau\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
In
 <a href="#Kraus:et-al:1990">Kraus et al. (1990)</a>
 it is shown that a consequence relation \(\nc\) is preferential if
and only if \(\nc = \nc^S\) for some preferential structure \(S\).
</p>

<p>
Given a set of conditional assertions \(\mathbf{K}\) of the type
\(\phi \nc \psi\) one may be interested in investigating what other
conditional assertions follow. The following two strategems lead to
the same results. The first option is to intersect all preferential
consequence relations \(\nc\) that extend \(\mathbf{K}\) (in the sense
that the conditional assertions in \(\mathbf{K}\) hold for \(\nc\))
obtaining the <em>Preferential Closure</em> \(\nc^{\mathrm{P}}\) of
\(\mathbf{K}\). The second option is to use the five defining
properties of preferential consequence relations as deduction rules
for syntactic units of the form \(\phi \nc \psi\). This way we obtain
the deductive <em>system P</em> with its consequence relation
\(\vdash^{\mathrm{P}}\) for which: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\mathbf{K} \vdash^{\mathrm{P}} \phi \nc \psi\) if and only if \(\phi
\nc^{\mathrm{P}} \psi\). </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>3.6.2 Various semantics</h4>

<p>
One of the most remarkable facts in the study of NMLs is that various
other semantics have been proposed &mdash;often independently and
based on very different considerations&mdash; that also adequately
characterize preferential consequence relations. This underlines the
central status of the core properties in the formal study of
defeasible reasoning. </p>

<p>
Many of these approaches use structures \(S = (\Omega, \Pi)\) where
\(\Omega\) is again a set of classical models and \(\Pi\) is a mapping
with the domain \(\wp(\Omega)\) (the set of subsets of \(\Omega\)) and
an ordered co-domain \((D, &lt;)\). The exact nature of \((D, &lt;)\)
depends on the given approach and we give some examples below. The
basic common idea is to let \(\phi \nc^S \psi\) in case \(\Pi([\phi
\wedge \psi])\) is preferable to \(\Pi([\phi \wedge \neg \psi])\) in
view of \(&lt;\). The following table lists some proposals which we
discuss some more below: </p>

  <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Possibility measures assign real numbers in the interval [0,1] to
propositions to measure their possibility, where 0 corresponds to
impossible states and 1 to necessary states
 (<a href="#Dubois:Prade:1990">Dubois and Prade 1990</a>).
 Ordinal ranking functions rank propositions via natural numbers
closed with &infin;
 (<a href="#Goldszmidt:Pearl:1992">Goldszmidt and Pearl 1992</a>,
 <a href="#Spohn:1988">Spohn 1988</a>). We may think of \(\kappa([\phi])\) as the level of
surprise that we would face if \(\phi\) holds, where &infin;
represents maximal surprise. Finally, plausibility measures
 (<a href="#Friedman:Halpern:1996">Friedman and Halpern 1996</a>,
 <a href="#Rott:2013">Rott 2013</a>) associate propositions with elements in a partially
ordered domain with the bottom element \(\bot\) and the top element
\(\top\) in order to compare their plausibilities. Given some simple
constraints on \(\mathrm{Pl}\) (such as: If \(\mathrm{Pl}(X) =
\mathrm{Pl}(Y) = \bot\) then \(\mathrm{Pl}(X \cup Y) = \bot\)) we
speak of <em>qualitative plausibility structures</em>. The following
statements are all equivalent, which emphasizes the centrality of the
core properties in the study of NMLs: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li> \(\mathbf{K} \vdash^P \psi\)</li>

<li> \(\phi \nc^S \psi\) for all preferential structures \(S\) for
which \(\nc^S\) extends \(\mathbf{K}\) </li>

<li> \(\phi \nc^S \psi\) for all possibilistic structures \(S\) for
which \(\nc^S\) extends \(\mathbf{K}\) </li>

<li> \(\phi \nc^S \psi\) for all ordinal ranking structures \(S\) for
which \(\nc^S\) extends \(\mathbf{K}\) </li>

<li> \(\phi \nc^S \psi\) for all qualitative plausibility structures
\(S\) for which \(\nc^S\) extends \(\mathbf{K}\) </li>
</ul>

<p>
Yet another well-known semantics that characterizes preferential
consequence relations makes use of <em>conditional probabilities</em>.
The idea is that \(\phi \nc \psi\) holds in a structure if the
conditional probability \(P(\psi \mid \phi)\) is closer to 1 than an
arbitrary \(\epsilon\), whence the name
\(\epsilon\)-<em>semantics</em>
 (<a href="#Adams:1975">Adams 1975</a>,
 <a href="#Pearl:1989">Pearl 1989</a>). </p>

<p>
The following example demonstrates that the intuitive idea of using a
threshold value such as &frac12; instead of infinitesimals and to
interpret \(\phi \nc \psi\) as \(P(\psi \mid \phi)\) &gt; &frac12;
does not work in a straightforward way. Let \(\alpha\) abbreviate
&ldquo;being a vegan&rdquo;, \(\beta\) abbreviate &ldquo;being an
environmentalist&rdquo;, and \(\gamma\) abbreviate &ldquo;avoiding the
use of palm oil&rdquo;. Further, let our knowledge base comprise the
statements &ldquo;&alpha;s are usually &beta;s,&rdquo;
&ldquo;\((\alpha \wedge \beta)\)s are usually &gamma;s&rdquo;. The
following Euler diagram illustrates the conditional probabilities in a
possible probability distribution for the given statements. </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="venn.png" alt="venn.png" width="200" />
</blockquote>

<p>
We have for instance: \(P(\beta \mid \alpha)\) = &frac34;, \(P(\gamma
\mid \alpha \wedge \beta)\) = &#8532; and \(P(\gamma \mid \alpha)\) =
&frac12;. Hence, under the proposed reading of \(\nc\), we get
\(\alpha \nc \beta\) and \(\alpha \wedge \beta \nc \gamma\) while we
do not have \(\alpha \nc \gamma\). This means that Cut is violated.
Similarly, it can be shown that other properties such as Or are
violated under this reading (e.g.,
 <a href="#Pearl:1988">Pearl 1988</a>).
 </p>

<p>
In view of these difficulties it is remarkable that there is a
probabilistic account according to which \(\phi \nc \psi\) is
interpreted as \(P(\psi \mid \phi)\) &gt; &frac12; and that
nevertheless characterizes preferential consequence relations
 (<a href="#Benferhat:et-al:1999">Benferhat et al. 1999</a>).
 The idea is to restrict the focus to structures \(S= (\Omega, P,
\prec)\) that have specific probability distributions known as
<em>atomic bound systems</em> or <em>big-stepped probabilities</em>.
First, a linear order \(\prec\) is imposed on the set of classical
models in \(\Omega\) over which the probability measure \(P\) is
defined. Second, \(P\) is required to respect this order by
&ldquo;taking big steps&rdquo;, i.e., in such a way that for any \(M
\in \Omega\), \(P(\{M\}) &gt; \sum\{P(\{M'\}) \mid M' \prec M\}\).
This warrants that \(\phi \nc \psi\) holds if and only if the unique
\(\prec\)-maximal model in \([\phi]\) validates \(\psi\) (in signs,
\(\max[\phi] \models
 \psi\)).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Here is how this helps us with the problematic example above:
\(\alpha \nc \beta\) means that \(\max[\alpha] \models \beta\) and
hence that \(\max[\alpha] = \max[\alpha \wedge \beta]\). \(\alpha
\wedge \beta \nc \gamma\) means that \(\max[\alpha \wedge \beta]
\models \gamma\) and hence \(\max[\alpha] \models \gamma\) which
implies \(\alpha \nc \gamma\). </p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#Gilio:2002">Gilio (2002)</a>
 an approach, is presented in which conditionals \(\alpha \nc \beta\)
are characterized by <em>imprecise conditional probabilities</em> \(0
\le \tau_1 \le P(\beta \mid \alpha) \le \tau_2 \le 1\) with a lower
bound \(\tau_1\) and an upper bound \(\tau_2\) on the conditional
probabilities. In this approach it is possible to determine how the
probability bounds degrade in view of applications of specific
inference rules. In
 <a href="#Ford:2004">Ford (2004)</a>
 this is used to distinguish argument strengths (see
 <a href="#Ford">above</a>).
 </p>

<h4>3.6.3 Beyond the core properties</h4>

<p>
Preferential consequence relations do not in general validate </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><b>Rational Monotony</b>: If \(\phi \nc \tau\) and \(\phi \nnc
\neg \psi\), then \(\phi \wedge \psi \nc \tau\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
A preferential consequence relation \(\nc\) that satisfies Rational
Monotony is called a <em>rational consequence relation</em>. These are
characterized by <em>ranked structures</em> which are preferential
structures \(S = (\Omega, \prec)\) for which \(\prec\) is
<em>modular</em>, that is, for all \(M, M', M'' \in \Omega\), if \(M
\prec M'\) then \(M'' \prec M'\) or \(M \prec M''\). One can picture
this as follows: models in \(\Omega\) are arranged in linearly ordered
levels, and the level of a model reflects its degree of normality (its
rank). </p>

<p>
The seminal
 <a href="#Kraus:et-al:1990">Kraus et al. (1990)</a>
 inspired a huge variety of subsequent work. We briefly highlight some
contributions. </p>

<p>
While in
 <a href="#Kraus:et-al:1990">Kraus et al. (1990)</a>
 the standard of deduction was classical propositional logic, in
 <a href="#Arieli:Avron:2000">Arieli and Avron (2000)</a>
 also nonclassical monotonic core logics and variants with multiple
conclusions are considered. Various publications investigate the
preferential and rational consequence relations in a first-order
language (e.g.,
 <a href="#Lehmann:Magidor:1990">Lehmann and Magidor 1990</a>,
 <a href="#Delgrande:1998">Delgrande 1998</a>,
 <a href="#Friedman:et-al:2000">Friedman et al. 2000</a>).
 Given the problematic status of Rational Monotony (see our discussion
in Section
 <a href="#DealDynaDefeReas">1</a>),
 alternative semantics have been investigated that validate weaker
properties such as Disjunctive Rationality (if \(\phi_1 \vee \phi_2
\nc \psi\) then \(\phi_1\nc\psi\) or \(\phi_2\nc\psi\)) (e.g., in
 <a href="#Freund:1993">Freund 1993</a>,
 <a href="#Rott:2014">Rott 2014</a>,
 <a href="#Booth:2021">Booth and Varzinczak 2021</a>)
 </p>

<p>
As we have seen, the properties of preferential or rational
consequence relations may also serve as deductive rules for syntactic
units of the form \(\phi \nc \psi\) under the usual readings such as
&ldquo;If \(\phi\) then usually \(\psi\).&rdquo; This approach can be
generalized to gain <em>conditional logics</em> by allowing for
formulas where a conditional assertion \(\phi \nc \psi\) is within the
scope of classical connectives such as \(\wedge, \vee, \neg\), etc.
(see e.g.,
 <a href="#Delgrande:1987">Delgrande 1987</a>,
 <a href="#Asher:Morreau:1991">Asher and Morreau 1991</a>,
 <a href="#Friedman:Halpern:1996">Friedman and Halpern 1996</a>,
 <a href="#Giordano:et-al:2009">Giordano et al. 2009</a>,
 <a href="#Egre:et-al:forthcoming">Egre et al. forthcoming</a>,
 and
 <a href="#Parent:2021">Parent 2021</a>
 for an overview on conditional deontic logics). </p>

<p>
We state one remarkable result obtained in
 <a href="#Boutilier:1990">Boutilier (1990)</a>
 that closely links the study of NMLs to the study of modal logics in
the Kripkean tradition. Suppose we translate the deduction rules of
system P into Hilbert-style axiom schemes such that, for instance,
Cautious Monotony becomes </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\vdash \bigl( ( \phi \nc \psi) \wedge (\phi \nc \tau) \bigr) \supset
\bigl( ( \phi \wedge \psi) \nc \tau \bigr)\) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Conditional assertions are shown to be expressible in standard
Kripkean modal frames in such a way that system P (under this
translation) corresponds to a fragment of the well-known modal logic
S4. An analogous result is obtained for the modal logic S4.3 and the
system that results from the strengthening system P with an axiom
scheme for Rational Monotony. </p>

<p>
Various contributions are specifically devoted to problems related to
relevance. Consider some of the conditional assertions in the Nixon
Diamond: \(\mathbf{K}\) = {<em>Quaker</em> \(\nc\) <em>Pacifist</em>,
<em>Republican</em> \(\nc\) &not;<em>Pacifist</em>}. It seems
desirable to derive e.g. <em>Quaker</em> \(\wedge\) <em>worker</em>
\(\nc\) <em>Pacifist</em> since in view of \(\mathbf{K}\), being a
worker is <em>irrelevant</em> to the assertion <em>Quaker</em> \(\nc\)
<em>Pacifist</em>. Intuitively speaking, <em>Quaker</em> \(\nc\)
&not;<em>worker</em> should fail in which case Rational Monotony
yields <em>Quaker</em> \(\wedge\) <em>worker</em> \(\nc\)
<em>Pacifist</em> in view of <em>Quaker</em> \(\nc\)
<em>Pacifist</em>. Hence, prima facie we may want to proceed as
follows: let \(\nc^{R}\) be the result of intersecting all rational
consequence relations \(\nc\) that extend \(\mathbf{K}\) (in the sense
that the conditional assertions in \(\mathbf{K}\) hold for \(\nc\)).
Unfortunately it is <em>not</em> the case that <em>Quaker</em>
\(\wedge\) <em>worker</em> \(\nc^{R}\) <em>Pacifist</em>. The reason
is simply that there are rational consequence relations for which
<em>Quaker</em> \(\nc\) &not;<em>worker</em> and whence Rational
Monotony does not yield the desired <em>Quaker</em> \(\wedge\)
<em>worker</em> \(\nc\) <em>Pacifist</em>. Moreover, it has been shown
that \(\nc^R\) is identical to the preferential closure \(\nc^P\).
</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#Lehmann:Magidor:1992">Lehmann and Magidor (1992)</a>
 a <em>Rational Closure</em> for conditional knowledge bases such as
\(\mathbf{K}\) is proposed that yields the desired consequences. We
omit the technical details. The basic idea is to assign natural
numbers, so-called ranks, to formulas that indicate how exceptional
they are relative to the given knowledge base \(\mathbf{K}\). Then the
ranks of formulas are minimized, which means that each formula is
interpreted as normally as possible. A conditional assertion \(\phi
\nc \psi\) is in the Rational Closure of \(\mathbf{K}\) if the rank of
\(\phi \wedge \psi\) is strictly less than the rank of \(\phi \wedge
\neg \psi\) (or \(\phi\) has no rank). The rank of a formula
\(\alpha\) is calculated iteratively. Let \(m(\mathbf{K}') = \{ \phi
\supset \psi \mid \phi \nc \psi \in \mathbf{K}'\}\) denote the
material counterpart of a given set of conditional assertions
\(\mathbf{K}'\). Let \(\mathbf{K}_0 = \mathbf{K}\). \(\alpha\) has
rank 0 if it is consistent with \(m(\mathbf{K}_0)\). Let
\(\mathbf{K}_{i+1}\) be the set of all members \(\phi \nc \psi\) of
\(\mathbf{K}_i\) for which the rank of \(\phi\) is not less or equal
to \(i\). \(\alpha\) has rank \(i+1\) if it doesn&rsquo;t have a rank
smaller or equal to \(i\) and it is consistent with
\(m(\mathbf{K}_{i+1})\). </p>

<p>
In our example <em>Quaker \(\wedge\) worker</em> has rank 0, just like
<em>Quaker</em>. This is strictly less than rank 1 of <em>Quaker
\(\wedge\) &not;Pacifist</em> and <em>Quaker \(\wedge\) worker
\(\wedge\) &not;Pacifist</em>. This means that the desired
<em>Quaker</em> \(\wedge\) <em>worker</em> \(\nc\) <em>Pacifist</em>
is in the Rational Closure of our \(\mathbf{K}\). </p>

<p>
A system equivalent to Rational Closure has been independently
proposed under the name <em>system <b>Z</b></em> based on
\(\epsilon\)-semantics in
 <a href="#Pearl:1990">Pearl (1990)</a>.
 A weaker version of Rational Closure has been proposed in
 <a href="#Booth:2021">Booth and Varzinczak (2021)</a>:
 it invalidates Rational Monotony, but validates Disjunctive
Rationality. </p>

<p>
One may consider it a drawback of Rational Closure that it suffers
from the Drowning Problem (see
 <a href="#drowning">above</a>).
 To see this, consider the following conditional knowledge base
<b>KL</b>: </p>

<blockquote>
<img src="logic-course.png" alt="logic-course.png" width="250" />
</blockquote>

<p>
We have the following ranks: </p>

<table class="cellpad-med vert-top hrules avoid-break centered">
<tr>
  <td>formula</td>
  <td>\(l\)</td>
  <td>\(c\)</td>
  <td>\(r\)</td>
  <td>\(f\)</td>
  <td>\(l \wedge f\)</td>
  <td>\(l \wedge \neg f\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>rank</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>1</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Since the ranks of \(l \wedge f\) and \(l \wedge \neg f\) are equal,
\(l\nc f\) is not in the rational closure of \(\mathbf{KL}\). </p>

<p>
This problem has been tackled in
 <a href="#Lehmann:1995">Lehmann (1995)</a>
 with the formalism <em>Lexicographic Closure</em>. Rougly the idea is
to compare models by measuring the severity of violations of
assertions in the given conditional knowledge base to which they give
rise. \(\phi \nc \psi\) is entailed by \(\mathbf{K}\) if the best
models of \(\phi \wedge \psi\) are better than the best models of
\(\phi \wedge \neg \psi\). A model \(M\) violates a conditional
assertion \(\phi \nc \psi\) if it validates \(\phi\) but not \(\psi\).
The severity of a violation is proportional to the rank of \(\phi\).
For instance, in our example we have the following models of \(l
\wedge f\) resp. of \(l \wedge \neg f\): </p>

<table class="cellpad-med vert-top hrules avoid-break centered">
<tr>
  <td>\(l\)</td>

</table>

<p>
The best model of \(l \wedge f\) is \(M_3\) since it does not violate
any conditional assertion of rank higher than 0, while all other
models of \(l \wedge f\) do. For the same reason \(M_7\) is the best
model of \(l \wedge \neg f\). Moreover, \(M_3\) violates less
conditional assertions of rank 0 than \(M_7\) and is thus the
preferred interpretation. Hence, \(l \nc f\) is in the Lexicographic
Closure. Altogether, what avoids the drowning problem in
Lehmann&rsquo;s approach is a combination between specificity handling
and a <em>quantitative rationale</em> according to which
interpretations are preferred that violate less conditionals. </p>

<p>
To highlight the latter, consider a knowledge base \(\mathbf{K}\)
consisting of </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><em>Party</em> \(\nc\) <em>Anne</em>,</li>

<li><em>Party</em> \(\nc\) <em>Phil</em>, and </li>

<li><em>Party</em> \(\nc\) <em>Frank</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We expect from each, Anne, Phil, and Frank to come to the party.
Suppose, moreover, we know that <em>Party</em> \(\wedge\) ((&not;
<em>Anne</em> \(\wedge\) &not; <em>Phil</em>) \(\vee\) &not;
<em>Frank</em>). In view of this fact, not all three assertions are
valid. At best, either the former two hold or the latter. If we try to
validate as many conditional assertions as possible, we will prefer
the situation in which only the latter is violated. This occurs in the
Lexicographic Closure of \(\mathbf{K}\) which contains </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><em>Party</em> \(\wedge\) ((&not; <em>Anne</em> \(\wedge\) &not;
<em>Phil</em>) \(\vee\) &not; <em>Frank</em>) \(\nc\)
&not;<em>Frank</em> and </li>

<li><em>Party</em> \(\wedge\) ((&not; <em>Anne</em> \(\wedge\) &not;
<em>Phil</em>) \(\vee\) &not; <em>Frank</em>) \(\nc\) <em>Anne</em>
\(\wedge\) <em>Phil</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Similar quantitative considerations play a role in the <em>Maximum
Entropy Approach</em> in
 <a href="#Goldzsmidt:et-al:1993">Goldzsmidt et al. (1993)</a>
 which is based on \(\epsilon\)-semantics. The basic idea is similar
to Lexicographic Closure: \(\phi \nc \psi\) is entailed by
\(\mathbf{K}\) if \(\min(\{\kappa(M) \mid M \models \phi \wedge
\psi\}) &lt; \min (\{\kappa(M) \mid M \models \phi \wedge \neg
\psi\})\), where \(\kappa(M)\) outputs a weigthed sum of violations in
\(M\) and where weights are attributed to violations in view of
specificity considerations. Similar to Lexicographic Closure the
violation of more specific conditionals weigh heavier than violations
of more general conditionals. As a consequence, just like in
Lexicographic Closure, \(l \nc f\) is entailed in our example and so
the drowning problem is avoided. A difference to Lexicographic Closure
is, for instance, that \(l \wedge \neg f \nc c\) is not entailed
according to the maximal entropy approach. The reason is that the
violation of several less specific assertions may in sum
counter-balance the violation of a more specific assertion. For
instance, while model \(M_7\) is preferred over model \(M_8\) in the
Lexicographic approach, in the Maximum Entropy both models turn out to
be equally good and the best models of \(l \wedge \neg f\). </p>

<h3 id="AssuBaseAppr">3.7 Assumption-based approaches</h3>

<p>
In a family of approaches, defeasible inferences are encoded as
material inferences with explicit assumptions: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[&dagger;] &emsp;&emsp; \((\phi \wedge \mathsf{as}) \supset \psi\)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
expresses that \(\phi\) defeasibly implies \(\psi\) on the assumption
that \(\mathsf{as}\) holds. The assumptions are interpreted as valid
&ldquo;as much as possible&rdquo;. There are various ways to give a
more precise meaning to this. </p>

<p>
One such approach is offered by <em>Adaptive Logics</em>
 (<a href="#Batens:2007">Batens 2007</a>,
 <a href="#Strasser:2014">Stra&szlig;er 2014</a>). An adaptive logic AL is given by a triple consisting
of </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>a <em>lower limit logic</em> LLL with a consequence relation
\(\vdash\) that is reflexive, monotonic, satisfies Cut, and is compact

LLL defines the deductive core of AL: all LLL-valid inferences are
AL-valid. AL strengthens LLL by allowing for defeasible inferences by
means of the following scheme: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[&Dagger;] &emsp;&emsp; Where \(\mathsf{ab}\) is an abnormal formula
in \(\Omega\): if \(\phi\vdash \psi \vee \mathsf{ab}\) then \(\psi\)
follows defeasibly from \(\phi\) on the assumption that
\(\mathsf{ab}\) is false (or, equivalently, that \(\neg \mathsf{ab}\)
is true). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Where \(\mathsf{as} = \neg \mathsf{ab}\), the antecedent of [&Dagger;]
is equivalent to \(\vdash (\phi \wedge \mathsf{as}) \supset \psi\)
which is [&dagger;] above (under the classical meaning of \(\neg,
\wedge\), and \(\vee\)). </p>

<p>
Examples of concrete classes of adaptive logics are: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li><em>Inconsistency-Adaptive Logics</em>
 (<a href="#Batens:1980">Batens 1980</a>,
 <a href="#Batens:1999">Batens 1999</a>,
 <a href="#Priest:1991">Priest 1991</a>):
 In domains in which contradictions may occur it is useful to work
with a paraconsistent core logic LLL that has a negation \(\sim\) that
is non-explosive (\(p, {\sim} p \nvdash q\)) and for which disjunctive
syllogism doesn&rsquo;t hold (\(\phi \vee \psi, {\sim} \phi \nvdash
\psi\)). Let \(\Omega\) consist of \(\sim\)-contradictions in logical
atoms (\(p \wedge {\sim} p\)). Then we have \(p \vee q, {\sim} p
\vdash q \vee \mathsf{ab}\) where \(\mathsf{ab} = p \wedge {\sim}p\).
This means, disjunctive syllogism can be applied on the assumption
that there is no \(\sim\)-contradiction in \(p\). This way LLL is
significantly strengthened in a non-monotonic way. </li>

<li><em>Adaptive Logics of Inductive Generalizations</em>: Let LLL be
CL and consider a \(\Omega\) that contains, for instance, formulas of
the form \(\exists x P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\). Then we have,
for example, \(P(a) \vdash \forall x P(x) \vee \mathsf{ab}\) where
\(\mathsf{ab} = \exists x P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\). This
means we inductively generalize from \(P(a)\) to \(\forall x P(x)\)
based on the assumption that the abnormality \(\mathsf{ab}\) does not
hold. (This is a simplified account compared to the more subtle logics
presented in
 <a href="#Batens:2011">Batens (2011)</a>.)
 </li>

<li> There are numerous adaptive logics for other defeasible reasoning
forms such as abductive reasoning, normative reasoning, belief
revision, diagnosis, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Adaptive logics implement the idea behind [&Dagger;] syntactically in
terms of a <em>dynamic proof theory</em>. A dynamic proof from the
premise set \(\{P(a), \neg P(b)\}\) for an adaptive logic of inductive
generalizations may look as follows: </p>

<table class="cellpad-small vert-top centered">
<tr>
  <td class="right">1.</td>
  <td>\(P(a)\)</td>
  <td>PREM</td>
  <td>&empty;</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td class="right">&#10003;2.</td>
  <td>\(\forall x P(x)\)</td>
  <td>1; RC</td>
  <td>\(\{\exists x P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\}\)</td> </tr>
<tr>

  <td>1,3; RU</td>
  <td>&empty;</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The last column of each line of the proof contains its condition, that
is, a set of abnormalities \(\mathrm{COND} \subseteq \Omega\) that
encode the assumptions used to derive the formula in the second column
of the line: each \(\mathsf{ab} \in \mathrm{COND}\) is assumed to be
false. The generic rule RU (rule unconditional) represents any
inference that is licensed by LLL. The generic rule RC (rule
conditional) follows scheme [&Dagger;] where \(\mathsf{ab}\) is pushed
to the condition of the line. Sometimes there are good reasons to
consider assumptions violated, in which case the corresponding lines
are &#10003;-<em>marked</em> as retracted. This is clearly the case if
the condition of a line is \(\mathrm{COND}\) while for a
\(\{\mathsf{ab}_1, \dotsc, \mathsf{ab}_n\} \subseteq \mathrm{COND}\),
\(\mathsf{ab}_1 \vee \mathsf{ab}_2 \vee \ldots \vee \mathsf{ab}_n\) is
derived without defeasible steps (i.e., on the condition &empty;).
This means that (at least) one of the formulas in \(\mathrm{COND}\) is
false. Thus, line 2 is marked as retracted when we reach line 4 of the
proof. In view of this behavior, dynamic proofs are internally
dynamic: Even if no new premises are introduced, the addition of new
lines may cause the retraction of previous lines of a proof. </p>

<p>
Not all cases of retraction are of this straightforward kind. Various
<em>adaptive strategies</em> come with marking mechanisms to handle
more complicated cases, such as the one in the following proof: </p>

<table class="cellpad-small vert-top centered">

  <td>&empty;</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The formula \(\forall x P(x) \vee \forall x Q(x)\) is derived at line
4 and 5 on two respective conditions: \(\{\exists x P(x) \wedge \neg
\forall x P(x)\}\) and \(\{\exists x Q(x) \wedge \neg \forall x
Q(x)\}\). Neither \(\exists x P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\) nor
\(\exists x Q(x) \wedge \neg \forall x Q(x)\) is derivable on the
condition &empty;. However, both are part of the (minimal) disjunction
of abnormalities derived at line 6. According to one strategy, the
<em>minimal abnormality strategy</em>, the premises are interpreted in
such a way that as many abnormalities as possible are considered to be
false, which leaves us with two interpretations: one in which
\(\exists x P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\) holds while \(\exists x
Q(x) \wedge \neg \forall x Q(x)\) is false, and another one in which
\(\exists x Q(x) \wedge \neg \forall x Q(x)\) holds while \(\exists x
P(x) \wedge \neg \forall x P(x)\) is false. In both interpretations
either the assumption of line 4 or the assumption of line 5 holds
which means that in either interpretation the defeasible inference to
\(\forall x P(x) \vee \forall x Q(x)\) goes through. Thus, according
to the minimal abnormality strategy neither line 4 nor line 5 is
marked (we omit the technical details). Another strategy, the
<em>reliability strategy</em>, is more cautious. According to it any
line that involves an abnormality in its condition that is part of a
minimal disjunction of abnormalities derived on the condition &empty;
is marked. This means that in our example, lines 4 and 5 are marked.
</p>

<p>
Lines may get marked at specific stages of a proof just to get
unmarked at later stages and vice versa. This mirrors the internal
dynamics of defeasible reasoning. In order to define a consequence
relation, a stable notion of derivability is needed. A formula derived
at an unmarked line <em>l</em> in an adaptive proof from a premise set
\(\Gamma\) is considered a <em>consequence of \(\Gamma\)</em> if any
extension of the proof in which <em>l</em> is marked is further
extendable so that the line is unmarked again. </p>

<p>
Such a consequence relation can equivalently be expressed semantically
in terms of preferential semantics (see Section
 <a href="#SeleSema">Selection semantics</a>).
 Given an LLL-model \(M\) we can identify its <em>abnormal part</em>
\(Ab(M) = \{\mathsf{ab} \in \Omega \mid M \models \mathsf{ab}\}\) to
be the set of all abnormalities that hold in \(M\). The selection
semantics for minimal abnormality can be phrased as follows. We order
the LLL-models by \(M \prec M'\) if and only if \(Ab(M) \subset
Ab(M')\). Then we define that \(\phi\) is a semantic consequence of
\(\Gamma\) if and only if for all \(\prec\)-minimal LLL-models \(M\)
of \(\Gamma\), \(M\models \phi\). (We omit selection semantics for
other strategies.) </p>

<p>
A similar system to adaptive logics makes use of maximally consistent
sets. In
 <a href="#Makinson:2003">Makinson (2003)</a>
 it was developed under the name <em>default assumptions</em>. Given a
set of assumptions \(\Xi\), </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Gamma \nc[\Xi] \phi\) if and only if \(\Xi' \cup \Gamma \vDash
\phi\) for all \(\Xi' \subseteq \Xi\) that are maximally consistent
with \(\Gamma\) (i.e., \(\Xi' \cup \Gamma\) is consistent and there is
no \(\Xi'' \subseteq \Xi\) for which \(\Xi' \subset \Xi''\) and
\(\Xi'' \cup \Gamma\) is consistent). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we take \(\Xi\) to be \(\{\neg \mathsf{ab} \mid \mathsf{ab} \in
\Omega\}\) then we have an equivalent characterization of adaptive
logics with the minimal abnormality strategy and the set of
abnormalities \(\Omega\)
 (<a href="#VanDePutte:2013">Van De Putte 2013</a>).
 </p>

<p>
<em>Conditional Entailment</em> is another assumption-based approach
 (<a href="#Geffner:Pearl:1992">Geffner and Pearl 1992</a>).
 Suppose that we start with a theory \(T = (\Delta, \Gamma, \Lambda)\)
where \(\Delta = \{\phi_i \rightarrow \psi_i \mid i \in I\}\) consists
of default rules, \(\Gamma\) consists of necessary facts, while
\(\Lambda\) consists of contingent facts. It is translated into an
<em>assumption-based theory</em> \(T' = (\Delta', \Gamma', \Lambda)\)
as follows: </p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>For each \(\phi_i \rightarrow \psi_i \in \Delta\) we introduce a
designated assumption constant \(\pi_i\) and encode \(\phi_i
\rightarrow \psi_i\) by \(\phi_i \wedge \pi_i \supset \psi_i\). The
former is just our scheme [&dagger;] while the latter makes sure that
assumptions are &mdash;by default&mdash; considered to hold. </li>

<li>The set of defaults \(\Delta'\) is \(\{\phi_i \rightarrow \pi_i
\mid i \in I\}\) and our background knowledge becomes \(\Gamma' =
\Gamma \cup \{\phi_i \wedge \pi_i \supset \psi_i \mid i \in I\}\).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just as in the adaptive logic approach, models are compared with
respect to their abnormal parts. For a classical model \(M\) of
\(\Gamma' \cup \Lambda\), \(Ab(M)\) is the set of all \(\pi_i\) for
which \(M \models \neg \pi_i\). One important aspect that
distinguishes conditional entailment from adaptive logics and default
assumptions is the fact that it implements the Specificity Principle.
For this, the assumptions are ordered by means of a (smooth) relation
&lt;. The models are then compared as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(M \lessdot M'\) if and only if \(Ab(M) \neq Ab(M')\) and for all
\(\pi_i \in Ab(M)\setminus Ab(M')\) there is a \(\pi_j \in Ab(M')
\setminus Ab(M)\) for which \(\pi_i &lt; \pi_j\). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea is: \(M\) is preferred over \(M'\) if every assumption
\(\pi_i\) that does not hold in \(M\) but that holds in \(M'\) is
&lsquo;compensated for&rsquo; by a more specific assumption \(\pi_j\)
that holds in \(M\) but that does not hold in \(M'\). </p>

<p>
For this to work, &lt; has to include specificity relations among
assumptions. Such orders &lt; are called <em>admissible</em> relative
to the background knowledge \(\Gamma'\) if they satisfy the following
property: for every set of assumptions \(\Pi \subseteq \{\pi_i \mid i
\in I\}\), if \(\Pi\) violates some default \(\phi_j \rightarrow
\pi_j\) in view of the given background knowledge \(\Gamma'\) (in
signs, \(\Pi, \phi_j, \Gamma' \models \neg \pi_j\)) then there is a
\(\pi_k \in \Pi\) for which \(\pi_k &lt; \pi_j\). </p>

<p>
This is best understood when put into action. Take the case with
Tweety the penguin. We have \(\Delta' = \{ p \rightarrow \pi_1, b
\rightarrow \pi_2\}\), \(\Gamma' = \{ p \supset b, p \wedge \pi_1
\supset \neg f, b \wedge \pi_2 \supset f\}\), and \(\Lambda = \{p\}\).
Let \(\Pi = \{\pi_2\}\). Then \(\Pi, \Gamma', p \models \neg \pi_1\)
and thus for &lt; to be admissible, \(\pi_2 &lt; \pi_1\). We have two
types of models of \(\Gamma' \cup \Lambda\): models \(M_1\) for which
\(M_1 \models \pi_1\) and therefore \(M_1 \models \neg f\) and models
\(M_2\) for which \(M_2 \models \pi_2\) and thus \(M_2 \models f\).
Note that \(M_1 \lessdot M_2\) since for the only assumption in
\(Ab(M_1)\) &mdash;namely \(\pi_2\)&mdash; there is \(\pi_1 \in
Ab(M_2) \setminus Ab(M_1)\) and \(\pi_2 &lt; \pi_1\). </p>

<p>
Analogous to adaptive logics with the minimal abnormality strategy,
conditional entailment is defined via \(\lessdot\)-minimal models:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\Delta', \Gamma', \Lambda) \nc \phi\) if and only if for each
admissible &lt; (relative to \(\Gamma'\)) and all \(\lessdot\)-minimal
models \(M\) of \(\Gamma' \cup \Lambda\), \(M \models \phi\). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In our example, \(\neg f\) is a conditionally entailed since all
\(\lessdot\)-minimal models have the same abnormal part as \(M_1\).
</p>

<p>
A consequence of expressing defeasible inferences via material
implication in assumption-based approaches is that defeasible
inferences are <em>contrapositable</em>. Clearly, if \(\phi \wedge \pi
\supset \psi\) then \(\neg \psi \wedge \pi \supset \neg \phi\). As a
consequence, formalisms such as default logic have a more greedy style
of applying default rules. We demonstrate this with conditional
entailment. Consider a theory consisting of the defaults \(p_1
\rightarrow p_2\), \(p_2 \rightarrow p_3\), \(p_3 \rightarrow p_4\)
and the factual information \(\Lambda = \{p_1, \neg p_4\}\) (where
\(p_i\) are logical atoms). In assumption-based approaches such as
conditional entailment the defeasible rules will be encoded as \(p_1
\wedge \pi_1 \supset p_2\), \(p_2 \wedge \pi_2 \supset p_3\), and
\(p_3 \wedge \pi_3 \supset p_4\). It can easily be seen that &lt; =
&empty; is an admissible ordering which means that for instance a
model \(M\) with \(Ab(M) = \{\pi_1\}\) is \(\lessdot\)-minimal. In
such a model we have \(M \models \neg p_3\) and \(M \models \neg p_2\)
by reasoning backwards via contraposition from \(\neg p_4 \wedge
\pi_3\) to \(\neg p_3\) and from \(\neg p_3 \wedge \pi_2\) to \(\neg
p_2\). This means that neither \(p_2\) nor \(p_3\) is conditionally
entailed. </p>

<p>
The situation is different in default logic where both \(p_2\) and
\(p_3\) are derivable. The reasoning follows a greedy policy in
applying default rules: whenever a rule is applicable (that is, its
antecedent holds by the currently held beliefs \(\Xi\) and its
consequent does not contradict with \(\Xi\)) it is applied. There is
disagreement among scholars on whether and when contraposition is a
desirable property for defeasible inferences (e.g.,
 <a href="#Caminada:2008">Caminada 2008</a>,
 <a href="#Prakken:2012">Prakken 2012</a>). </p>

<h2 id="NonMonoLogiHumaReas">4. Non-monotonic logic and human reasoning</h2>

<p>
In view of the fact that test subjects seem to perform very poorly in
various paradigmatic reasoning tests (e.g., Wason&rsquo;s Selection
Task
 (<a href="#Wason:1966">Wason 1966</a>)
 or the Supression Task
 (<a href="#Byrne:1989">Byrne 1989</a>)),
 main streams in the psychology of reasoning have traditionally
ascribed to logic at best a subordinate role in human reasoning. In
recent years this assessment has been criticized as the result of
evaluating performances in tests against the standard of classical
logic, whereas other standards based on probabilistic considerations
or on NMLs have been argued to be more appropriate. </p>

<p>
This resulted in the rise of a new probabilistic paradigm
 (<a href="#Oaksford:Chater:2007">Oaksford and Chater 2007</a>,
 <a href="#Pfeifer:Douven:2014">Pfeifer and Douven 2014</a>) where probability theory provides a calculus for
rational belief update. Although the program is sometimes phrased in
decidedly anti-logicist
 terms,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 logic is here usually understood as monotonic and deductive. The
relation to NML is less clear and it has been argued that there are
close connections especially to probabilistic accounts of NML
 (<a href="#Over:2009">Over 2009</a>,
 <a href="#Pfeifer:Kleiter:2009b">Pfeifer and Kleiter 2009</a>).
 <a href="#Politzer:Bonnefon:2009">Politzer and Bonnefon 2009</a>
 warn against the premature acceptance of the probabilistic paradigm
in view of the rich variety of alternatives such as possibility
measures, plausibility measures, etc.). </p>

<p>
Another argument for the relevance of NML is advocated in
 <a href="#Stenning:Van-Lambalgen:2008">Stenning and Van Lambalgen (2008)</a>
 who distinguish between reasoning <em>to</em> and reasoning
<em>from</em> an interpretation. In the former process, agents
establish a logical form that is relative to both the specific context
in which the reasoning takes place and to the agent&rsquo;s goals.
When establishing a logical form, agents choose&mdash;inter
alia&mdash;a formal language, a semantics (e.g., extensional vs.
intensional), a notion of validity, etc. Once a logical form is
established, agents engage in law-like rule-based inferences which are
based on this form. It is argued that in the majority of cases in
standard reasoning tasks, subjects use non-monontonic logical forms
that are based on closed world assumptions. </p>

<p>
Non-monotonic logicians often state that their motivation stems from
observing the defeasible structure of actual commonsense reasoning.
Empirical studies have been explicitly cited as both inspiration for
working on NMLs and as standards against which to evaluate NMLs.
However, it has also been noted that logicians often rely too much on
their own intuitions without critically assessing them against the
background of empirical studies
 (<a href="#Pelletier:Elio:1997">Pelletier and Elio 1997</a>).
 </p>

<p>
Various studies investigate their test subjects&rsquo; tendency to
reason according to specific inference principles of NMLs. Most
studies support the descriptive adequacy of the rules of system P.
However, there are some open or controversial issues. For instance,
while some studies report results suggestive of the adequacy of
weakened monotony principles such as Cautious Monotony
 (<a href="#Schurz:2005">Schurz 2005</a>,
 <a href="#Neves:et-al:2002">Neves et al. 2002</a>,
 <a href="#Pfeifer:Kleiter:2005c">Pfeifer and Kleiter 2005</a>)
 and Rational Monotony
 (<a href="#Neves:et-al:2002">Neves et al. 2002</a>),
 <a href="#Benferhat:et-al:2005">Benferhat et al. (2005)</a> report mixed results. Specificity considerations play a
role in the reasoning process of test subjects in
 <a href="#Schurz:2005">Schurz (2005)</a>,
 whereas according to
 <a href="#Ford:Billington:2000">Ford and Billington (2000)</a>
 they do not.
 <a href="#Benferhat:et-al:2005">Benferhat et al. (2005)</a>
 are specifically interested in the question whether the responses of
their test subjects corresponded better to Lexicographic Closure or
Rational Closure. Although the results were not fully conclusive, they
still suggest a preference for the former. </p>

<p>

 <a href="#Pelletier:Elio:1994">Pelletier and Elio (1994)</a>
 investigate various relevant factors that influence subjects&rsquo;
reasoning about exceptions of defaults or inheritance relations. Their
study makes use of the benchmark problems for defeasible reasoning
proposed in
 <a href="#Lifschitz:1989">Lifschitz (1989)</a>.
 For example, it is observed that the exceptional status of an object
<em>A</em> with respect to some default is more likely to spread to
other objects if they share properties with <em>A</em> that may play a
role in explaining the exceptional status. For example, when
confronted with a student club that violates the default that student
clubs only allow for student members, subjects are more likely to
ascribe this exceptional status also to another club if they learn
that both clubs have been struggling to maintain minimum membership
requirements. </p>

<p>
The question of the descriptive adequacy of NMLs for human reasoning
is also related to questions concerning the nature and limits of
cognitive modules in view of which agents are capable of logical
reasoning. For instance, the question arises whether such modules
could be realized on a neurological level. Concerning the former
question there are successful representations of NMLs in terms of
neural networks (see
 <a href="#Stenning:Van-Lambalgen:2008">Stenning and Van Lambalgen (2008)</a>,
 <a href="#Garcez-et-al:2009">Garcez et al (2009)</a>,
 <a href="#Hoelldobler-Kalinke:1994">H&ouml;lldobler and Kalinke (1994)</a>
 for
 <a href="#ClosWorlAssu">logic programming</a>
 with closed world assumptions,
 <a href="#Besold-et-al:2017">Besold et al (2017)</a>
 for input/output logic, and
 <a href="#Leitgeb:2001">Leitgeb (2001)</a>
 for NMLs in the tradition of
 <a href="#SeleSema">Selection semantics</a>).
 </p>

<p>
Human reasoning is constrained by limited computational resources,
available information, and time, leading it to rely on heuristic
shortcuts. Some scholars argue that nonmonotonic reasoning serves as
an adaptive evolutionary strategy for humans
 (<a href="#Schurz:2005">Schurz 2005</a>,
 <a href="#Gabbay:2008">Gabbay and Woods 2008</a>). With respect to the limitations of human reasoning
capabilities, the logics discussed here are idealized, often assuming
logical closure, among other things. Recently, research into
resource-bounded models of defeasible inference has been gaining
momentum (e.g.
 <a href="#DAgostino:2018:2">D&rsquo;Agostino and Modgil 2018</a>,
 <a href="#Beierle:2019">Beierle and Kutsch 2019</a>,
 <a href="#Ehab:2021">Ehab and Ismail 2021</a>).
 </p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
There are three main issues connected with the development of logical
frameworks that can adequately represent defeasible reasoning:
(<em>i</em>) material adequacy; (<em>ii</em>) formal properties; and
(<em>iii</em>) complexity. A non-monotonic formalism is materially
adequate to the extent to which it captures examples of defeasible
reasoning and to the extent to which it has intuitive properties. The
question of formal properties has to do with the degree to which the
formalism gives rise to a consequence relation that satisfies
desirable theoretic properties such as the above-mentioned
Reflexivity, Cut, and Cautious Monotony. The third set of issues has
to do with the computational complexity of the most basic questions
concerning the framework. </p>

<p>
There is a potential tension between (<em>i</em>) and (<em>ii</em>):
the desire to capture a broad range of intuitions can lead to <em>ad
hoc</em> solutions that can sometimes undermine the desirable formal
properties of the framework. In general, the development of NMLs and
related formalisms has been driven, since its inception, by
consideration (<em>i</em>) and has relied on a rich and well-chosen
array of examples. Of course, there is some question as to whether any
single framework can aspire to be universal in this respect. </p>

<p>
More recently, researchers have started paying attention to
consideration (<em>ii</em>), looking at the extent to which NMLs have
generated well-behaved relations of logical consequence. As
 <a href="#Makinson:1994">Makinson (1994)</a>
 points out, practitioners of the field have encountered mixed
success. In particular, one abstract property, Cautious Monotony,
appears at the same time to be crucial and elusive for many of the
frameworks to be found in the literature. This is a fact that is
perhaps to be traced back, at least in part, to the above-mentioned
tension between the requirement of material adequacy and the need to
generate a well-behaved consequence relation. </p>

<p>
The complexity issue appears to be the most difficult among the ones
that have been highlighted. NMLs appear to be stubbornly intractable
with respect to the corresponding problem for classical logic. This is
clear in the case of default logic, given the ubiquitous consistency
checks. But in addition to consistency checks, there are other, often
overlooked, sources of complexity that are purely combinatorial. Other
forms of non-monotonic reasoning, besides default logic, are far from
immune from these combinatorial roots of intractability. Although some
important work has been done trying to make various non-monotonic
formalisms more tractable, this is perhaps the problem on which
progress has been slowest in coming. </p>
