<p>
Nominalism is an exclusionary thesis in ontology. It asserts that
there are no entities of certain sorts. Precisely which entities it
excludes depends on the relevant variety of nominalism, but nominalist
theses typically deny the existence of universals or abstract
entities. For those who accept nominalism, a central challenge in
metaphysics is to make sense of phenomena that anti-nominalist
theories explain via universals or abstract entities. For instance,
anti-nominalists often rely upon universals to explain similarity,
propositions to explain linguistic meaning, and numbers to explain
mathematical truth. Nominalists who reject the existence of such
entities must therefore find a credible way to explain how things can
be similar without sharing universals, have linguistic meaning without
expressing propositions, or be truths of mathematics without the
existence of any mathematical entities.</p>

<p>
Since nominalists seek to provide metaphysical theories without
positing universals or abstract entities, the resulting nominalist
theories often require distinctive resources and face significant
competition in the form of rival anti-nominalist theories. It is also
controversial whether the nominalist prohibitions against universals
or abstract entities are justifiable. This entry surveys arguments for
nominalism, opposing anti-nominalist arguments for the existence of
universals or abstract entities, and a variety of nominalist theories
that eschew commitment to such entities.</p>

<p>
Before proceeding, a note on terminology and scope is needed.
Throughout this entry, we use &ldquo;anti-nominalism&rdquo; and its
cognates to denote theories that accept the existence of universals or
abstract entities. The term &ldquo;anti-nominalism&rdquo; avoids the
historical connotations of the commonly used term
&ldquo;platonism.&rdquo; The history of nominalism in metaphysics is
extensive and resists concise summary except to say that the reality
of universals, numbers, propositions, and related entities has long
been controversial. This entry sets aside this lengthy history to
focus on the contemporary metaphysical debates regarding nominalism.
(See the entry on the medieval problem of universals.) Finally,
&ldquo;nominalism about <em>F</em>s&rdquo; is typically understood as
the thesis that <em>F</em>s do not exist, and to deny the existence of
a category of entities is to adopt a metaphysical position regarding
such entities. &lsquo;Nominalism in metaphysics&rsquo; might therefore
seem a redundant title for this entry since any version of nominalism
must be within the realm of metaphysics. Our focus in what follows is,
however, with nominalism as a view that informs metaphysical debates
regarding universals as well as putative abstracta such as properties,
propositions, and types. While we will touch upon certain arguments
from the philosophy of mathematics that have been influential in
shaping the metaphysical debate over nominalism, and while there is no
clear-cut divide between metaphysics and the philosophy of
mathematics, our focus is on the status of nominalism in the former
rather than the latter.</p>

<h2 id="WhaNomMet">What is Nominalism in Metaphysics?</h2>

<p>
Contemporary debates regarding nominalism are troubled by
terminological obstacles. Typically, nominalism is understood as one
of two theses: (1) <em>nominalism about universals</em>, which denies
that such entities exist and holds instead that all entities are
particulars or individuals; (2) <em>nominalism about abstract
entities</em>, which denies that such entities exist and holds instead
that there are only concrete entities. On some views, (2) entails (1)
since universals are properly categorized as abstract rather than
concrete. For example, some views take universals to be eternal,
non-spatiotemporal, necessarily existing entities and therefore
categorize universals as abstract rather than concrete (see Bealer
1993 and Jubien 2001). Others reject this view about the location and
necessity of universals and instead hold universals to be concrete
entities. In light of the resulting complexity, we will, at key points
in what follows, separately examine nominalism about universals and
nominalism about abstract entities since the debate over these
nominalist theses can differ significantly. For instance, a familiar
motivation for nominalism about universals is a metaphysical concern
about the possibility of entities being wholly shareable by distinct
material objects. In contrast, objections against abstract entities
like sets or propositions are unlikely to concern shareability.
Instead, arguments for nominalism about abstract entities are often
motivated by the fact that such entities are alleged to exist outside
space or time and are therefore mysterious or unknowable. Despite
these differences, nominalist opposition to universals or abstract
entities often significantly overlaps.</p>

<p>
Since the rejection of abstract entities and the rejection of
universals are related but separable concerns, we begin by discussing
each of these two strands of nominalism. In each case, we assume that
nominalism is a thesis regarding the <em>existence</em> of entities.
An alternative approach to understanding nominalism holds it to
concern <em>fundamentality</em> rather than existence. On this
alternative way of understanding nominalism, it is the denial that
universals or abstract entities are fundamental entities. Conversely,
anti-nominalism, when so understood, is the thesis that such entities
are fundamental. Although matters of fundamentality and metaphysical
dependence are highly relevant to the debate over nominalism, we
assume here that nominalism is specifically a thesis regarding
existence rather than fundamentality. (On fundamentality and
ontological disagreement, see Cameron 2008, Schaffer 2009, Imaguire
2018, Schulte 2019, and Declos 2021.)</p>

<p>
Alongside the above nominalist theses regarding universals and
abstract entities, an influential thesis labelled as
&ldquo;nominalism&rdquo; is defended by Nelson Goodman and draws upon
preceding work in Leonard and Goodman 1940. Goodman&rsquo;s version of
nominalism asserts that all entities are &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; in
the specific sense of being mereological atoms or constructed via
mereology. As Goodman (1956: 25) notes, this version of nominalism is
potentially compatible with the existence of certain sets or classes,
but rejects any ontology of sets or classes which admits &ldquo;the
composition of more than one entity out of exactly the same entities
by membership.&rdquo; For this reason, Goodman&rsquo;s nominalism is
incompatible with standard versions of set theory which accept the
construction or generation of sets in violation of classical
extensional mereology (e.g., a hierarchy of pure sets constructed from
a single empty or null set). (On this version of nominalism, see
Cohnitz and Rossberg 2006, Oliver 1993, Eberle 1970, and Dummett
1956.) Despite receiving less attention than nominalism regarding
universals or abstract entities, Goodman&rsquo;s nominalism is
comprehensive in its development and historically influential,
receiving attention in Lewis 1991 (38&ndash;41).</p>

<p>
This entry largely leaves aside discussion of views that find fault
with both nominalism and anti-nominalism on metaontological grounds.
For instance, we will not examine the relationship of nominalism with
views like those of Carnap (1950) that reject the standard
interpretation of ontological claims like &ldquo;Numbers exist&rdquo;
or &ldquo;There are no universals&rdquo; assumed by most nominalists
and anti-nominalists. For metaontological challenges to the standard
conception of the debate over nominalism, see Balaguer 1998, Chalmers
2009, and Thomasson 2005.</p>

<h3 id="NomRejUni">1.1 Nominalism as the Rejection of Universals</h3>

<p>
Nominalism about universals is the thesis that there are no universals
(see Armstrong 1978). While this sounds simple enough, the notion of a
universal is complicated. To begin, we can introduce a separate notion
of a <em>qualitative nature</em>, where such natures, if they exist,
are responsible for the world&rsquo;s qualitative variation and
sameness. Consider, for example, a red apple and a green avocado. If
there are qualitative natures, then the apple and the avocado have
distinct color-relevant qualitative natures, one relevant to redness
and one relevant to greenness. They also enjoy distinct
texture-relevant qualitative natures, one relevant to smoothness and
the other to bumpiness. Further examples are easy to generate, and, if
there are qualitative natures, then there is potentially one for every
possible qualitative classification.</p>

<p>
Suppose that there are such entities as qualitative natures. Then the
apple and the avocado each has a color-relevant one. Moreover, the
apple&rsquo;s color-relevant qualitative nature is
<em>numerically</em> distinct from the avocado&rsquo;s. Now consider a
second apple of exactly the same shade of red as the first apple. By
stipulation, the first apple&rsquo;s color-relevant qualitative nature
is <em>qualitatively</em> identical to the second apple&rsquo;s
color-relevant qualitative nature, insofar as both apples resemble
exactly in color. But is the first apple&rsquo;s color-relevant
qualitative nature also <em>numerically</em> identical to that of the
second apple? Or are qualitative natures the kind of entity that
cannot be in more than one spatial location or &ldquo;inhere&rdquo; in
more than one object at the same time?</p>

<p>
This final question is helpful for understanding the debate over
universals: can a single qualitative nature be in more than one
location (or inhere in more than one object or enjoy more than one
instance) at the same time? If one answers affirmatively, then one
likely accepts universals. If one answers negatively, then the
resulting view will likely fall into one of two further camps. First,
if one accepts the presupposition that there <em>are</em> qualitative
natures but denies that they can be in more than one location or
object or instance at a time, one likely rejects universals while
accepting what are usually called <em>tropes</em>. A trope is a
particular (i.e., non-universal) qualitative nature. That is, the
whole qualitative nature is not in multiple places or shared by
multiple disjoint individuals at the same time. For most theorists,
tropes are specific to their location, or even to their bearer
(Williams 1953, Campbell 1990, Maurin 2002, and Fisher 2020; see the
entry on tropes). Others allow wholly multi-located tropes (Ehring
2011), or shared tropes, so long as one of the sharing bearers is a
part of the other, as when an apple and its skin share a redness trope
(Giberman 2022b). Alternatively, if one denies the presupposition that
there are any qualitative natures, one likely rejects both universals
and tropes and instead accepts what we will call <em>strict
nominalism</em> about properties. Strict nominalists deny that any
kind of special metaphysical posits are needed to explain the
world&rsquo;s qualitative variety. Instead, strict nominalism holds
that the phenomenon of qualitative variety is reducible to facts about
entities other than qualitative natures, for example, to material
objects, sets of material objects, mereological sums of material
objects, or linguistic-cognitive facts (see Quine 1948, Sellars 1963,
Lewis 1983, Effingham 2020).</p>

<p>
When nominalism is understood as the rejection of universals, it is
regularly assumed that trope theory (and, of course, strict
nominalism) qualify as nominalist views. Since universals are wholly
shareable entities (the whole universal may be shared by disjoint
bearers), the case for nominalism about universals is often premised
upon this controversial feature. Arguments against nominalism about
universals frequently concern distinctive properties relevant to their
putative shareability that are ascribed to them by competing accounts
of universals&mdash;e.g., their alleged lack of spatiotemporal
location or the alleged possibility of being wholly located in
multiple places at the same time. Nominalists about universals often
seek to avoid these commitments when assigning entities the general
theoretical role of &ldquo;property.&rdquo; Nominalism-friendly
candidates for that role include tropes; sets, pluralities, or fusions
of tropes; and sets, pluralities, or fusions of material objects. Such
entities are compatible with nominalism about universals, since they
avoid commitment to the existence of wholly multiply located or
non-spatial qualitative natures. They are, however, potentially
incompatible with nominalism about abstract entities depending upon
the assumed understanding of &ldquo;abstract entity.&rdquo; For
example, theories that accept nominalism regarding universals in part
by identifying properties with sets of tropes risk violating
nominalism about abstract entities by virtue of accepting the
existence of sets, which are standardly categorized as abstract
entities (see, e.g., Ehring 2011).</p>

<p>
Despite the unwelcome complexity, understanding the debate over
nominalism and universals requires carefully distinguishing universals
from non-universals (or &lsquo;particulars&rsquo;), without
identifying the concept of a universal with the concept of a
qualitative nature. This leaves open the difficult question of what
features distinguish universals from non-universals. Various proposals
have been advanced. Universals have been claimed to be distinctive
insofar as they are <em>predicable</em> (i.e., they can be true or
false of something: Carmichael 2010), <em>multiply located</em> (i.e.,
they can be wholly located in distinct regions of space at the same
time: Armstrong 1978, Lewis 1986: 83, Giberman 2022a), <em>multiply
instantiable</em> (i.e., they can be had by distinct entities: Hoffman
and Rosenkrantz 2003), <em>subject to the principle of the identity of
indiscernibles</em> (Wisdom 1934, Williams 1986, Ehring 2004, 2011),
<em>being the fundamental explanans of qualitative similarity</em>
(Armstrong 1978) or <em>serving as the semantic value of qualitative
predication</em> (van Inwagen 2004). Despite these theoretical options
for distinguishing universals from particulars, there is no consensus
as to which, if any, of the suggested distinguishing criteria of
universality listed above is the correct one. For instance, while some
posit universals and assert that they are multiply located, rival
theories of universals hold that they are <em>ante rem</em> entities
that lack any spatiotemporal location whatsoever. This has led some
philosophers to doubt that there is any such criterion (Ramsey 1925,
MacBride 2005).</p>

<p>
In summary, precisely characterizing nominalism about universals is
controversial, since the precise characterization of universals is
controversial. Clarity can be gained by focusing on the concept of
qualitative nature, when understood as a concept neutral between
theories that accept universals and theories that accept tropes. As we
have also seen, nominalism regarding universals may sometimes be used
in the &ldquo;strict&rdquo; sense above, according to which there are
no such entities as qualitative natures regardless of whether they are
universals, tropes, or various constructions from such entities. There
are many interesting versions of strict nominalism in the literature,
including some that have been newly developed or recently defended.
Section 4 surveys several nominalist strategies for addressing the
metaphysics of qualitative natures.</p>

<h3 id="NomRejAbsEnt">1.2 Nominalism as the Rejection of Abstract Entities</h3>

<p>
In their influential discussion of nominalism, Quine and Goodman
(1947: 105) begin as follows: &ldquo;We do not believe in abstract
entities. No one supposes that abstract entities&mdash;classes,
relations, properties, etc.&mdash;exist in space-time; but we mean
more than this. We renounce them altogether.&rdquo; While the
respective views of Quine and Goodman would subsequently change, this
early discussion helped popularize a conception of nominalism that is
not tied to the rejection of universals but instead to the more
general rejection of <em>abstract entities</em> where this category is
usually taken to include numbers, classes, properties, propositions,
and several other kinds of entities such as linguistic types,
biological kinds, and fictional characters. Although Quine and Goodman
explicitly refuse to provide a positive argument against abstract
entities in their paper, ontological suspicions regarding such
entities are regularly encountered: abstract entities seem markedly
unlike ordinary concrete entities, and, in the case of classes or
numbers, a commitment to their existence is a commitment to infinitely
many imperceptible entities outside space and perhaps outside time.
Overviews of the case for nominalism and metaphysical worries about
abstract entities can be found in Burgess and Rosen 1997 (3&ndash;66),
Szab&oacute; 2003, Cowling 2017, and Liggins 2023. Also see the entry
on abstract objects.</p>

<p>
The abstract-concrete distinction that separates entities and
structures the debate over this version of nominalism is often held to
be an exclusive and exhaustive distinction that partitions all of
reality (see Hale 1988 and Grossman 1992: 7). Mathematical entities
like the number seven or the Pythagorean theorem serve as paradigm
examples of abstract entities and ordinary objects like tables and tap
shoes are paradigm examples of concrete entities. In turn, entities
are often assumed to have their abstract or concrete status
permanently and necessarily (see Melia 2008a: 146, but cf. Williamson
2010 and Linsky and Zalta 1996). Although the concept of an abstract
(or concrete) entity can be adopted as a primitive notion,
philosophers have more usually sought to provide an analysis of what
it is for an entity to be abstract (or concrete). And, given the
assumed exclusiveness and exhaustiveness of the distinction, an
analysis of either the concept <em>abstract entity</em> or
<em>concrete entity</em> would suffice for defining the complementary
concept. (On alleged features of the abstract-concrete distinction,
see Cowling 2017: 70&ndash;74.)</p>

<p>
Lewis (1986: 81&ndash;86) summarizes several approaches for
understanding the abstract-concrete distinction and applies each to
his modal realist theory of possible worlds. His influential
discussion makes evident that there are a considerable variety of
non-equivalent conceptions of the abstract-concrete distinction. Of
these, two have been especially influential and warrant brief
summary.</p>

<p>
According to the <em>spatiotemporal approach</em>, the distinction
between abstract and concrete entities should be understood in terms
of spatial or spatiotemporal location: abstract entities lack
locations, while concrete entities have them. With regard to our
paradigm examples, this approach renders a plausible verdict: numbers
do not seem to be anywhere (even if inscriptions that name them are),
and pieces of furniture surely seem to be located in spacetime. As we
move beyond paradigm cases, tough questions multiply quickly. Are
spacetime regions located at themselves, or are they abstract? Is the
set that has Obama as a member, {Obama}, located where Obama is or
nowhere at all? What of views on which universals are wholly located
where they are instantiated? And, when we turn to more controversial
cases, it is far from clear that this approach offers any useful
guidance. For instance, while Hamlet and <em>Hamlet</em> do not seem
to have spatial locations, they do seem to have come into existence
around 1600. Might they have temporal but not spatial locations? And
what would that fact mean for their status as abstract or concrete
entities? Additional challenges for this approach revolve around the
case of souls or deities that are purported to exist outside space or
time. On most views, such entities are not plausibly included in the
category of abstract entity, especially given relationships they are
thought to bear to concrete reality. (On spatial and spatiotemporal
approaches, see Hale 1988, Lowe 1995, and Hoffman and Rosenkrantz
2003.)</p>

<p>
According to a competing <em>causal approach</em>, the distinction
between abstract and concrete entities should be understood in terms
of causal interaction: abstract entities do not causally interact with
anything, but concrete entities do (or at least can). Tables and
chairs are created, destroyed, reflect photons, and stub toes; numbers
do none of these things. Like the spatiotemporal approach, the causal
approach faces difficult questions when we seek answers regarding the
abstract/concrete status of non-paradigm cases. If musical works and
works of fiction are created by humans, then how could they be
abstract entities given this causal approach? If properties are
abstract entities, then how can properties like <em>being fragile</em>
occupy causal roles in our theories? Could there be what Forrest
(1982) calls an <em>epiphenomenalon</em>, a concrete entity which
essentially stands in no causal relations whatsoever? Some of these
questions clearly require us to provide a fully-fledged theory of
causal interaction, but others seem to suggest that the
abstract-concrete division is not ultimately a causal one. (See entry
on objects.)</p>

<p>
Alternative approaches for analyzing the abstract-concrete distinction
draw upon the above features&mdash;e.g., by taking abstract entities
to be <em>essentially</em> non-spatiotemporal&mdash;or require
altogether different resources&mdash;e.g., by holding abstract
entities to lack certain kinds of qualitative or intrinsic properties
(see Cowling 2017: 74&ndash;92, and Hoffman and Rosenkrantz 2003:
46&ndash;52). There remains no uncontroversial way to draw the
abstract-concrete distinction, but the consequences of nominalism
regarding abstract entities depend directly upon the correct account
of the distinction. For example, if abstract entities are held to be
distinctively non-spatiotemporal, nominalism proves equivalent to the
thesis that reality is entirely spatiotemporal.</p>

<p>
As Quine and Goodman&rsquo;s remark above makes clear, the truth of
nominalism about abstract entities promises to have a significant
impact on a wide range of metaphysical projects. For instance, if
there are no such things as linguistic types and there are only
specific concrete inscriptions, how can we provide general theories of
semantics or syntax? After all, our talk about the word
&ldquo;moose&rdquo; and its meaning appear to be about the type
&ldquo;moose&rdquo;, not any specific token. This worry points toward
difficult questions about what exactly types are and whether they are
abstract rather than concrete. (On types, see Wetzel 2009, Dodd 2000,
and entry on
 <a href="../types-tokens/">types and tokens</a>.)
 If nominalism about abstract entities does require that we do without
types, how can we truthfully speak of the common housecat, the Nanaimo
Bar, or the foxtrot? Similar issues have been raised regarding a broad
variety of entities, each of which have been alleged to be abstract
rather than concrete: numbers, sets, functions, directions,
propositions, meanings, properties, kinds, possibilities, possible
worlds, fictional works, fictional characters, musical works, events,
states of affairs, and many more besides.</p>

<p>
If the just-listed entities are indeed abstract, then nominalism about
abstract entities would seem to be of profound philosophical
significance. Aesthetic theories cannot truly ascribe properties to
fictional or musical works. Ethical theories cannot evaluate the moral
properties of events, states of affairs, or types of events.
Epistemological theories cannot correctly describe our justification
for believing propositions or accurately enumerate possibilities
involving skeptical scenarios. And so on across philosophy. To be
sure, some philosophers are content to assume anti-nominalism and
other philosophers hold the fate of their preferred theories to be
somehow independent of the debate over abstract entities. But most
nominalists take the nonexistence of abstract entities to have
far-reaching implications for the kinds of theories we can reasonably
accept. Precisely which theories are ruled out by nominalism will, as
noted above, depend upon the correct account of the abstract-concrete
distinction.</p>

<p>
Since the abstract-concrete distinction is controversial, nominalists
who rely upon it to formulate their metaphysical theories face an
important challenge. They must provide a principled defense for
drawing the abstract-concrete distinction in the first place. This is
because it is open to metaphysicians to reject the distinction as a
mandatory commitment and deny that it usefully or accurately
categorizes entities. For example, in evaluating the view that
ordinary objects are set-theoretic constructions, Sider (2013: 287)
asserts that the abstract-concrete distinction is not a mandatory
theoretical commitment but is instead eliminable if it proves to be
theoretically useless or unhelpfully obscure. If our balance of
evidence suggests we are best served to dispense with this
distinction, nominalists would seem to be obliged to abandon their
central thesis or instead to reformulate it, perhaps as a series of
specific prohibitions against positing numbers, properties,
propositions, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="ArgForNomMet">2. Arguments for Nominalism in Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Why accept nominalism and thereby reject the existence of universals
or abstract entities? In this section, we consider the case for each
version of nominalism, beginning with the case of nominalism about
abstract entities. According to Goodman and Quine (1943: 105), their
commitment to this form of nominalism &ldquo;is based on a
philosophical intuition that cannot be justified by appeal to anything
more ultimate.&rdquo; Few philosophers have been content to accept
this foundationalist rationale for nominalism about abstract entities.
(Quine and Goodman subsequently revised their increasingly divergent
views on nominalism. See Goodman 1956 and Quine 2008.) In place of a
dogmatic insistence on the truth of nominalism, a range of arguments
have been mounted that either identify significant problems with
anti-nominalism or purport to show that nominalist alternatives are
ultimately preferable.</p>

<h3 id="CauArgForNom">2.1 Causal Arguments for Nominalism</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most influential arguments in defense of nominalism are
those premised upon the allegedly non-causal nature of paradigmatic
abstract entities like numbers and sets. The <em>locus classicus</em>
is Benacerraf 1973, which poses an epistemic challenge for
anti-nominalist theories: to account for justified beliefs about
mathematical entities in the absence of causal interaction between
believers and mathematical entities. This challenge stems from the
apparently non-causal nature of abstract entities and an allegedly
causal dimension of epistemic justification. As Benacerraf remarks,
&ldquo;a typical &lsquo;standard&rsquo; account (at least in the case
of number theory or set theory) will depict truth conditions in terms
of conditions on objects whose nature, as normally conceived, places
them beyond the reach of the better understood means of human
cognition (e.g., sense perception and the like)&rdquo; (p. 668).
Benacerraf&rsquo;s initial presentation of the epistemic argument
remains influential; however, Field (1980, 1989) offers an alternative
formulation and defense of the causal-epistemic argument in support of
nominalism. Field&rsquo;s version of the argument is premised, not
upon a causal constraint on justification, but on an allegedly
insurmountable problem for anti-nominalists: to explain plausibly the
justified mathematical beliefs we take mathematicians and others to
possess in the absence of a causal relationship between epistemic
agents and mathematical reality. (On causal-epistemic arguments, see
Cheyne 1998, Nutting 2020, Liggins 2010, Sj&ouml;lin Wirling
forthcoming.)</p>

<p>
Causal-epistemic arguments hinge upon whether anti-nominalists can
account for our knowledge of abstract entities if such entities are
indeed non-causal and therefore not epistemically accessible through
ordinary means. Subsequent discussions of anti-nominalist epistemology
have sought to provide a credible account of our awareness of abstract
entities and our justified beliefs regarding them (see Chudnoff 2012,
Bengson 2015, Lewis 1986: 108&ndash;115, and Clarke-Doane 2017). As
some have noted, a parallel issue arises if we assume causal
interaction is necessary for <em>semantic relations</em> like
reference between speakers and abstract entities like numbers. This
parallel causal-semantic version of the above argument against
abstract entities is more usually mentioned than defended, however
(see Jubien 1977, Lear 1977, and Davies 2019).</p>

<p>
A different causation-based argument for nominalism relies upon a
metaphysical thesis, sometimes called the Eleatic Principle or
Alexander&rsquo;s Dictum, according to which entities must stand in
causal relations or be causally active in order to exist (see Oddie
1982 and Colyvan 1998). Granted this controversial thesis as well as
the essentially non-causal nature of abstract entities, nominalism
would seem to follow. Versions of anti-nominalism that claim fictional
characters, musical works, types, and other apparently created
entities are abstract are significantly less likely to grant that
abstract entities are essentially non-causal, given the causal
character of creation. Anti-nominalist views about these kinds of
entities are diverse, however, with some asserting they are abstract
yet, unlike mathematical entities, nevertheless able to stand in
causal relations (see Caplan and Matheson 2006, Mag Uidhir 2013, and
Friedell 2020).</p>

<h3 id="OthArgForNom">2.2 Other Arguments for Nominalism</h3>

<p>
Other arguments against abstract entities seek to show that nominalist
theories are stronger, better justified, or otherwise more virtuous
than anti-nominalist competitors. These arguments are dependent upon
the specific content of nominalist and anti-nominalist rivals, but the
most familiar arguments are premised upon ontological
parsimony&mdash;roughly speaking, nominalists believe in fewer
entities than anti-nominalists and hold that, other things being
equal, we ought to prefer simpler theories to less simple
alternatives. This parsimony-driven defense of nominalism assumes that
parsimony is a theoretical virtue, which makes belief in certain
theories better justified (see Parsons 1976, Nolan 1999, and Bricker
2020). For this line of argument to succeed, dispensing with
ontological commitment to abstract entities must not require excessive
theoretical vices like undue complexity in formulation, additional
primitive notions, or other significant theoretical costs.
Additionally, as Melia (2008b) notes, the option of dispensing with
abstract entities is only one way to secure ontological simplicity.
For example, an alternative would be to dispense with concrete
entities and develop a Pythagorean metaphysics of exclusively abstract
entities. This illustrates how the evaluation of theories occurs in a
complex and interconnected way where additional virtues like
conservativeness&mdash;roughly, conformity with extant
commitments&mdash;play an under-recognized role.</p>

<p>
Another family of arguments sometimes held to favor nominalism about
abstract entities stems from worries about indeterminacy or
non-uniqueness that result from positing abstract entities in our
mathematical, semantic, or metaphysical theories. As Benacerraf (1965)
argues, some anti-nominalist accounts of mathematics face a serious
challenge: how to choose from among incompatible yet equally plausible
candidate reductions of arithmetical notions like <em>natural
number</em> to set theory. For example, should we accept the account
that identifies the number two with the set {{0}} in one sequence or
with {0,{0}} in a different yet equally viable sequence? Roughly
speaking, anti-nominalists seem required to either privilege a unique
set-theoretic reduction without principled reasons or instead accept
that certain theoretical notions like <em>natural number</em> are
surprisingly indeterminate in meaning. As subsequent commentators have
noted, a parallel non-uniqueness problem arises when providing a
theory of propositions or properties in terms of set theory.
Additional versions of the problem have been alleged to arise when
anti-nominalists accept ontologically rich conceptions of properties
(see Moore 1999, Caplan and Tillman 2013, Melia 1992). In addition,
Field (1980: ii) suggests that worries about the &ldquo;desirability
of eliminating certain sorts of &lsquo;arbitrariness&rsquo; or
&lsquo;conventional choice&rsquo;&rdquo; are quite general and serve
as important motivations for nominalism. The non-uniqueness problem
has prompted the development of certain structuralist approaches to
the philosophy of mathematics. While some of these are nominalist in
character, other anti-nominalist versions hold structures to be
abstract entities (see Chihara 2004, Shapiro 1997, Resnik 1981,
Hellman 1989, and the entry on structuralism in the philosophy of
mathematics).</p>

<p>
Despite the fact that some philosophers hold our thought and talk
about possibilities to require a commitment to possibilities as
abstract entities, modal considerations have also been used to support
the case for nominalism. For example, Humeans about modality reject
necessary connections between distinct entities, and, for most
anti-nominalists, commitment to properties, propositions, or
mathematical entities specifically require such connections. (On
Humeanism, see Lewis 1986, Wilson 2015, Nolan 1996.) For instance, on
a standard anti-nominalist view, the truth of certain claims about
individuals and properties is analyzed in terms of the instantiation
of properties. For instance, if May is human, then, according to the
proposed anti-nominalist analysis, May must instantiate <em>being
human.</em> Such an analysis, in turn, entails additional claims about
properties&mdash;e.g., that, if May is human, then May instantiates
the property <em>having some property or other</em> and that <em>being
human</em> instantiates the property <em>being a property</em>.
Anti-nominalist analyses of this sort often connect properties with
propositions. So, in our present example, if May is human, then the
proposition <em>that May is human</em> must exist and instantiate the
property <em>being true</em>. Necessary connections among properties
and propositions are standard features of these kinds of metaphysical
analyses and, for this reason, a commitment to Humeanism is in tension
with those theories committed to abstract entities that stand in such
metaphysically necessary relationships.</p>

<p>
Modality-based arguments against anti-nominalist theories have also
been advanced with weaker assumptions and without a dependence upon
Humeanism. For instance, Dorr (2008) notes that anti-nominalists are
obliged to accept a vast number of &ldquo;brute necessities&rdquo; if
abstract entities are to play their required theoretical role. (Unlike
Humeanism, this stricture against brute necessities is potentially
consistent with necessary connections between entities.) A prohibition
against admitting brute necessities into our theories has therefore
been cited as a reason to reject anti-nominalism. Brute necessities
also play a key role in an argument Lewis (1986: 174&ndash;191) offers
against certain anti-nominalist theories of possible
worlds&mdash;views he describes as forms of &ldquo;magical
ersatzism.&rdquo; Whether Lewis&rsquo;s argument against magical
ersatzism can be deployed against some or perhaps all other abstract
entities remains unclear, but van Inwagen (1986) discusses the
application of this modality-driven argument to the case of sets (see
Nolan 2020 and Himelright 2023). An additional modal challenge for
anti-nominalism arises in explaining the distinctive necessary
existence of abstract entities&ndash;e.g., precisely why they are
necessary rather than contingent beings. See Rosen 2002 on whether
anti-nominalism is more plausibly viewed as a contingent or necessary
thesis.</p>

<p>
Immediately after their bold proclamation that the justification of
nominalism requires no further support, Quine and Goodman suggest that
the case for nominalism can be &ldquo;fortified&rdquo; by other
considerations. Specifically, they say that &ldquo;what seems to be
the most natural principle for abstracting classes or properties leads
to paradoxes&rdquo; and &ldquo;[e]scape from these paradoxes can
apparently be effected only by recourse to alternative rules whose
artificiality and arbitrariness arouse suspicion that we are lost in a
world of make-believe&rdquo; (1943: 105). This remark makes salient
the threat of paradox that looms in the development of formal theories
regarding mathematical entities like classes as well as properties,
propositions, and others (see entry on
 <a href="../russell-paradox/">Russell&rsquo;s Paradox</a>).
 Nominalist alternatives to set theory premised upon mereology are
notable responses to such paradoxes (for discussion, see entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lesniewski/#EarMer">Stanis&#322;aw Le&#347;niewski</a>).
 In addition to the worry that specific theories regarding abstract
entities like classes or properties might succumb to paradox, there is
the further worry that the interaction of certain independently
plausible anti-nominalist theories might lead to paradox&mdash;e.g.,
Kaplan&rsquo;s Paradox, which involves set theory and its interaction
with the metaphysics of propositions and possibilities (Kaplan 1995).
While worries about paradox might militate against specific theories
of sets, properties, propositions, and so on, there is little
compelling evidence that it is the abstractness of the relevant
entities that makes them endemically or unavoidably paradoxical. Nor
is the formal character of the relevant theories plausibly thought to
be the unique source of difficulty. For instance, F.H. Bradley&rsquo;s
influential regress argument threatens to show that certain
conceptions of properties, facts, or states of affairs yield vicious,
infinite explanatory regresses, but Bradley-style arguments have been
deployed against anti-nominalist theories that are largely informal in
their presentation and development (see Bradley 1893 and the entry on
Bradley&rsquo;s regress). It seems, then, the allegedly
&ldquo;fortifying&rdquo; considerations mentioned by Quine and Goodman
do little to constitute a general case against the existence of
abstract entities.</p>

<h2 id="ArgAgaNomMet">3. Arguments against Nominalism in Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Arguments for anti-nominalism purport to establish the existence of
abstract entities or universals. In doing so, they raise (at least)
two kinds of questions. The first kind of question concerns
<em>ontological commitments</em>&mdash;roughly, whether numbers,
universals, fictional works, and so on exist. The second kind of
question concerns <em>categoreal</em>
<em>commitments</em>&mdash;roughly, whether or not the relevant
entities are correctly categorized as abstract rather than concrete.
We considered the latter issue in Section One and noted the
controversy about how to distinguish between abstract and concrete
entities. (A parallel issue was also seen to arise for nominalism
regarding universals in distinguishing universals from particulars.)
Since answers to these ontological and categoreal questions are
separable, nominalists can reject anti-nominalist alternatives in
either of two ways: they can deny the <em>ontological</em> component,
which asserts that entities of a certain sort exist, or they can deny
the <em>categoreal</em> component, according to which the relevant
entities are abstract or universal. This section sets aside potential
categoreal disagreements and surveys arguments offered in defense of
the existence of abstract entities and universals.</p>

<p>
There are many ways to partition the field of anti-nominalist
arguments. One way to do so begins by dividing <em>semantic</em>
anti-nominalist arguments, which proceed on the basis of facts about
meaning and reference, from <em>alethic</em> anti-nominalism
arguments, which are premised upon the truth of claims that apparently
involve abstract entities. A direct semantic argument for
anti-nominalism asserts that sentences like &lsquo;Seven is an even
number&rsquo; is meaningful and that terms like &ldquo;the Pythagorean
Theorem&rdquo;, &ldquo;Superman&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<em>Piano Sonata in
B Minor</em>&rdquo; refer to or express abstract entities and, given
these semantic facts, the existence of abstract entities follows as a
consequence. Such arguments have the virtue of not presupposing
specific claims about, say, mathematics, but nevertheless depend upon
the relevant semantic theses about reference or meaning and their
connection to ontology. More frequently, however, anti-nominalists
develop their case for abstract entities on alethic grounds by
observing the acceptability and apparent truth of the following kinds
of claims:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Seven is a prime number.</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>The Pythagorean Theorem is more familiar than its converse.</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>Superman was created after Liszt&rsquo;s <em>Piano Sonata in B
Minor</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Alethic arguments proceed from the truth of sentences like
(1)&ndash;(3) plus an additional principle that links the truth of
these claims to the existence of the abstract entities that are their
apparent subject matter. A variety of principles have been proposed to
play this linking role and thereby support the anti-nominalist
conclusion. We will briefly note three broad approaches to providing
such a principle, which we will group as Fregean, truthmaker-based,
and Quinean.</p>

<p>
The Fregean approach invokes a thesis about the linguistic category of
terms like &ldquo;seven&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Pythagorean Theorem&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;Superman&rdquo; in sentences like (1)&ndash;(3) and notes
that in such cases these expressions function as singular terms. So,
given the truth of such claims, the existence of the number seven, the
Pythagorean Theorem, and Superman is held to follow. This broad
approach, inspired by Frege (1884), takes questions about the
existence of entities to be properly answered by determining whether
they are the referents of singular terms in true sentences. Discussing
the argument for the existence of numbers in Frege 1884, Hale (1996:
438) summarizes this argument schema as follows: &ldquo;statements of
the kind in question&hellip; are to be regarded as involving
expressions&hellip; functioning as singular terms; thus, since the
function of a singular term is precisely to effect reference to an
object, the truth of those statements requires the existence of the
objects to which the expressions refer.&rdquo; The existence of the
number seven is therefore a consequence of the truth of (1) and the
linguistic category of the term &ldquo;seven&rdquo; as it occurs
within (1). Importantly, this approach holds that the notion of object
is conceptually connected with the semantics and syntax of certain
expressions and that truth is a guide to ontological fact. (On Fregean
arguments for abstract entities, see Wright 1983, Rosen 1993, and
MacBride 2003.)</p>

<p>
Truthmaker-based approaches discern the ontological consequences of
sentences like (1)&ndash;(3) by asking what entity (or entities) serve
as their truthmaker(s). On this approach, the truthmaking relation is
a distinctive one that holds between sentences or propositions, on the
one hand, and entities like facts, states of affairs, or objects on
the other. (On truthmaker theory, see Armstrong 2004 and the entry on
 <a href="../truthmakers/">truthmakers</a>.
 On truthmaking and nominalism, see Armstrong 1997: 115, Melia 2005,
and Asay 2020: 175&ndash;197.) The extraction of ontological
commitments via truthmaker theory crucially depends upon the details
of the relevant theory of truthmakers and truthmaking rather than the
semantics or syntax of claims like (1)&ndash;(3). For instance, some
truthmaker theorists hold the sentence &lsquo;Socrates is a
human&rsquo; has as its truthmaker a fact or state of affairs
involving Socrates and the property <em>being human.</em> Contrasting
truthmaker approaches instead hold that neither facts, states of
affairs, or properties are required by the truth of &lsquo;Socrates is
human&rsquo;; it requires instead tropes or perhaps only the existence
of Socrates as he actually is as a truthmaker. Along with differing
general approaches to truthmaking, the precise truthmaker posited for
a sentence is regularly a matter of controversy. The truthmaker
approach for defending anti-nominalism will hold that, without
abstract entities like seven, the Pythagorean Theorem, and Superman,
we cannot plausibly account for the truth of claims like
(1)&ndash;(3). If, however, truthmaker theorists can supply an account
of truthmaking that identifies viable, nominalist-friendly truthmakers
for claims like (1)&ndash;(3), nominalists are in a position to resist
a truthmaker-based argument for anti-nominalism.</p>

<p>
The Quinean approach supplements the truth of claims (1)&ndash;(3)
with a criterion of ontological commitment, which provides a method
for determining what entities must exist if such claims are true.
Roughly speaking, the Quinean criterion takes the ontological
commitments of a sentence to be the values of the variables that fall
within the scope of the quantifiers of the sentence when translated
into first-order logic as part of a theory. Where truthmaker-based
arguments depend upon a background theory of truthmaking, arguments of
this sort hinge upon a distinctive role for quantifiers and variables
as means of discerning the commitments of theories (see Quine 1948 and
the relevant sections of the entry on ontological commitment). For
instance, the sentence &ldquo;Socrates is human&rdquo; would be
translated as &ldquo;&exist;x Socratizes(x) &amp; Is-Human(x)&rdquo;
and thus any theory in which &ldquo;Socrates is human&rdquo; occurs is
ontologically committed to something that is Socrates by virtue of the
variable bound by the existential quantifier ranging over a domain
that includes such an entity. The Quinean criterion for ontological
commitment provides a highly specific answer to questions regarding
the ontological commitments of sentences; however, the Quinean
criterion leaves open which theories to accept as well as the proper
regimentation of theories and their constituent sentences. As we will
see below, some nominalist responses to Quinean arguments proceed by
denying that claims like (1)&ndash;(3) are properly regimented in ways
that require quantification over putatively abstract entities.</p>

<p>
In developing arguments for anti-nominalism, Quine&rsquo;s criterion
of ontological commitment is widely adopted; however, Quine pairs his
deployment of the criterion with a more general commitment to the
thesis of ontological naturalism, according to which our best, mature
scientific theories are the proper arbiters of what sentences we ought
to accept. In turn, these theories are our best guides to what exists.
The conjunction of Quine&rsquo;s criterion and ontological naturalism
along with the apparent indispensability of mathematical entities for
our best physical theories is the basis of what is often-called the
Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for mathematical realism. This
argument has been the subject of intense interest in the philosophy of
mathematics (see Quine 1970, Putnam 1971, Colyvan 2001 and entry on
 <a href="../mathphil-indis/">Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics</a>).
 Many who reject ontological naturalism nevertheless rely upon
Quine&rsquo;s criterion in order to determine what the ontological
commitments of true sentences might be. Quine&rsquo;s criterion is
therefore a premise in various arguments for different kinds of
abstract entities. For instance, Quine&rsquo;s criterion would seem to
suggest that, despite the fact that (3) is not part of any scientific
theory, its truth requires the existence of fictional characters and
musical works provided that one accepts that (3) ought to regimented
in a manner that requires quantification over entities that have the
property of <em>being Superman</em> or <em>being Liszt&rsquo;s Piano
Sonata in B Minor.</em></p>

<p>
The arguments above proceed from the truth of claims that apparently
express or refer to abstract entities. Other anti-nominalist arguments
focus on the explanatory role of abstract entities or universals as
theoretical posits. <em>Explanatory</em> or abductive arguments for
anti-nominalism aim to show that theories committed to the existence
of abstract entities provide the best or perhaps the only viable
explanations of certain phenomena. Generally speaking, anti-nominalist
theories enjoy an advantage in simplicity of formulation even if they
require the existence of abstract entities. In contrast, nominalist
theories often seek to replace or translate claims like (1)&ndash;(3)
into claims that make no reference to (and therefore require no
quantification over) abstract entities. Focus on explanatory
considerations in ontology has brought questions about theoretical
virtues and their correct application to the forefront of metaphysical
debate, while raising broader concerns about the (dis)analogies
between metaphysical posits like properties or propositions and
scientific posits like electrons or genes. (On theoretical virtues,
see Schindler 2018 and Nolan 1999.)</p>

<p>
Explanatory anti-nominalist arguments are wide-ranging. For example,
arguments for the existence of propositions allege that theories
without such entities are incapable of suitably explaining semantic
phenomena like meaning, linguistic practices like translation, or
cognitive phenomena like belief and doubt (see Church 1951). Parallel
arguments for anti-nominalist views about possible worlds hold that we
cannot satisfactorily explain our modal reasoning or the content of
our counterfactual thought and talk without positing such entities.
Additional arguments hold that our best theories of laws of nature
require commitment to universals and relations among universals, which
some hold to be abstract entities (see, e.g., Armstrong 1982 and
Tooley 1977). Other anti-nominalist arguments in the philosophy of art
claim that we cannot account for the phenomena of musical appreciation
or authentic performance without commitment to the existence of
musical works (see Dodd 2000). In advancing an argument for
properties, propositions, and other entities, the remarks of Church
(1951: 104) are representative of explanatory anti-nominalist efforts:
&ldquo;To those who find forbidding the array of abstract entities and
principles concerning them which is here proposed, I would say that
the problems which give rise to [an anti-nominalist theory] are
difficult and a simpler theory is not known to be possible.&rdquo;
Although propositions, properties, and possible worlds are familiar
posits of philosophical theories, the breadth and power of explanatory
anti-nominalist arguments is significantly increased if the pervasive
reference to and theorizing about entities like linguistic types,
biological kinds, and chemical properties like <em>malleability</em>
is best understood as abstract discourse. On such a view, our
commitments to abstract entities are exceptionally broad in scope.
(For a remarkable catalogue of the deployment of types in various
contexts, see Wetzel 2009: 3&ndash;21.)</p>

<h2 id="NomStr">4. Nominalist Strategies</h2>

<p>
Those who accept nominalism about abstract entities and hold that
entities like propositions, fictional entities, and numbers would be
properly categorized as abstract are in the difficult situation of
having to do without them. Nominalists of this kind must therefore
find a way to make sense of the apparent meaningfulness and apparent
truth of our thought and talk as in claims like (1)&ndash;(3) above.
This section provides an overview of what can be seen as the positive
component of nominalist metaphysical theories.</p>

<p>
We divide our survey of nominalist strategies by first considering
<em>general strategies</em>&mdash;roughly, strategies that are
applicable to a variety of domains that apparently concern abstract
entities like mathematical entities, propositions, musical works,
types, or other kinds. We then consider <em>property-theoretic
strategies</em>, which are specifically aimed at accounting for
property-theoretic phenomena like similarity, predication, and other
matters linked to qualitative natures. Although some general
strategies can be applied to the property-theoretic domain, nominalist
approaches within metaphysics have often focused specifically on the
case of properties. For this reason, a variety of distinctive
proposals regarding our thought and talk about properties have been
developed. The aim of the remaining two sections is therefore to
introduce a very broad range of nominalist theories within
metaphysics.</p>

<h3 id="GenNomStr">4.1 General Nominalist Strategies</h3>

<p>
Suppose that we accept nominalism about abstract entities and also
hold that some category of entities, <em>F</em>s, would be properly
categorized as abstract. It follows that, on our view, there are no
<em>F</em>s. How, then, can we make sense of the apparent
meaningfulness, truth, and usefulness of our thought and talk about
<em>F</em>s? As we noted in Section Three, claims such as
(1)&ndash;(3) are often used to motivate a commitment to abstract
entities. So, if nominalism about abstract entities is to prove an
attractive metaphysical position, nominalists are obliged to explain
how these claims might be (or merely appear to be) meaningful, true,
and useful, given the nonexistence of their ostensible subject
matter.</p>

<p>
General nominalist strategies seek to provide an account of what we
will call &ldquo;abstract discourse&rdquo;&mdash;roughly, theories or
claims such as (1)&ndash;(3) that apparently refer to and quantify
over entities like numbers, theorems, properties, fictional
characters, and so on. Given their commitment to abstract entities,
anti-nominalists are well positioned to treat abstract discourse as
meaningful, intended literally, true, as well as ontologically
committal. In contrast, nominalists must reject some component of the
anti-nominalist stance toward abstract discourse. In cataloging
various general nominalist strategies, we will leave aside certain
approaches that eschew abstract entities, but involve even broader
disagreements with anti-nominalists&mdash;e.g., idealism, solipsism,
and certain forms of skepticism. (On anti-nominalism and idealism, see
Hofweber 2016.)</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most radical nominalist view of abstract discourse is
<em>non-cognitivism</em>, according to which claims like (1)&ndash;(3)
are without ordinary semantic content. Such a view enjoys little
plausibility if we focus solely on the commonalities between abstract
discourse and ordinary discourse. This is because (1)&ndash;(3) seem
unexceptional when compared with parallel claims about concrete
entities. There are, however, a range of instrumentalist views
regarding our discourse about unobservable entities within scientific
theories that, if otherwise defensible, would provide a precedent for
accommodating abstract discourse. On these views, claims such as
(1)&ndash;(3) have no descriptive semantic function and serve instead
as &ldquo;instruments&rdquo; for systematizing our descriptive claims
about concrete entities. Instrumentalist views of this kind have been
specifically developed with regard to mathematical discourse and the
avoidance of ontological commitment to mathematical entities (see
Burgess 1983 and Leng 2010).</p>

<p>
For nominalists who accept that abstract discourse has semantic
content yet warrants a kind of non-literal construal, a different
strategy is to deny that claims like (1)&ndash;(3) are typically used
to assert their apparent semantic content and instead communicate
metaphorical or figurative information. Such views acknowledge merely
apparent commitment to numbers or propositions in claims like
(1)&ndash;(3) but recast them as &ldquo;representational aids&rdquo;
rather than entities named by singular terms. The taxonomy of
strategies that rely on this approach is controversial. Moreover,
several views about the content of abstract discourse may turn out to
undermine the possibility of literally denying the existence of
abstract entities, since attempts to assert the thesis of nominalism
would be surreptitiously non-literal. Figuralist and fictionalist
approaches of this sort, which seek to explain the representational
contribution of abstract discourse as broadly metaphorical, remain
actively debated. (For discussion, see Yablo 2002a, 2002b, 2005, and
the entries on fictionalism and fictionalism in the philosophy of
mathematics.)</p>

<p>
For nominalists who grant that abstract discourse is meaningful and
intended literally, a remaining alternative is to deny its truth. This
strategy sets nominalism about abstract entities in apparent conflict
with common sense, since nominalists must plausibly explain away the
robust intuition that at least some claims like (1)&ndash;(3) are
true.</p>

<p>
An influential strategy for nominalists who take abstract discourse to
be meaningful and intended literally is to hold that our alethic
intuitions about claims like (1)&ndash;(3) are best explained in
parallel to our intuitions that Sherlock Holmes is a detective or that
Garfield is a cat. All such claims are false <em>simpliciter</em> yet
true according to familiar and contextually salient fictions. (See,
e.g., Field 1980 on mathematical entities and Rosen 1990 on possible
worlds.) Although it is not true that Sherlock Holmes is a detective,
the following claim is held to be true: according to the Sherlock
Holmes stories, Sherlock Holmes is a detective. Once made explicit,
speakers are inclined to recognize the distinction between these kinds
of claims and the corresponding difference in their truth values.
Moreover, for nominalists who accept this sort of fictionalist
approach, the denial of claims like (1)&ndash;(3) can be paired with
the claim that there are contextually salient &ldquo;fictions&rdquo;
like arithmetic, property theory, or realism about propositions, any
of which can be used to explain our apparent confidence in the truth
of (1)&ndash;(3). Furthermore, the development and adoption of these
fictions is explained by their expedience or value in reasoning about
concrete entities. For instance, the development of a robust fiction
regarding numbers or about a plurality of abstract possible worlds is
of value precisely because it allows us to speak and reason in concise
or powerful ways about a world of exclusively concrete entities.</p>

<p>
In developing general nominalist strategies, efforts to provide
&ldquo;paraphrases&rdquo; of abstract discourse play a significant but
controversial role. For example, some nominalists have proposed that
we ought to reject the following sort of claim as false given its
ontological commitment to the number two:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>Two is the number of solar gas giants.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
At the same time, the nominalist who pursues this paraphrase strategy
holds the following sentence, (5), to be true and lacking the
ontological commitment of (4) to the abstract entity, the number
two:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(5)</dt>
<dd>There is a solar gas giant <em>x</em> and a solar gas giant
<em>y</em> and <em>x</em> is distinct from <em>y</em> and every solar
gas giant is either identical to <em>x</em> or identical to
<em>y</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The final component of this paraphrase strategy holds that our
ontological commitments are determined by nominalist-friendly
sentences like (5) that serve as &ldquo;replacements&rdquo; of claims
like (4). Importantly, if (4) and its replacement (5) are supposed to
be synonymous, it is unclear how only one could be true or why the
nominalist is obliged to accept only the ontological commitments of
(5) rather than (4). If, however, the proffered replacement for (4)
need not be synonymous, the nominalist who pursues this strategy must
explain precisely why it is a satisfactory replacement that obviates
the ontological commitments of (4). For these and other reasons, the
role of paraphrase in ontological debates, especially those regarding
abstract entities, remains a controversial topic in nominalist
metaphysics (see Alston 1958, Keller 2015, von Solodkoff 2014, Melia
2000).</p>

<p>
Burgess and Rosen (1997, 2005) draw an influential distinction among
nominalist strategies which is useful for understanding the structure
and aims of various approaches. They divide <em>hermeneutic
nominalists</em> who hold that &ldquo;nominalist disbelief in numbers
and their ilk is in the fullest sense compatible with belief in
current mathematics and science&rdquo; (p. 7) from <em>revolutionary
nominalists</em> who take as their goal &ldquo;reconstruction or
revision: the production of novel mathematical and scientific theories
to replace current theories&rdquo; (p. 6). (On this distinction, see
Hellman 2001.) This distinction draws out a key question for would-be
nominalists: how can we reconcile the nominalist rejection of abstract
entities with the role abstract discourse plays in our best scientific
theories? Broadly speaking, Burgess and Rosen&rsquo;s revolutionary
nominalist approaches seek to produce &ldquo;novel theories by
assigning novel meanings to the words of current theories&rdquo; in
order to &ldquo;permit the nominalist to speak and write just like
everyone else while doing mathematics or science&rdquo; while, at the
same time, providing a nominalistic reinterpretation of such claims
&ldquo;while doing philosophy&rdquo; (p. 6). In contrast, their
hermeneutic nominalist does not aim to produce anything novel by way
of reconstrual or reinterpretation. Instead, the hermeneutic
nominalist claims that nominalist theories are ultimately &ldquo;an
analysis of what really &lsquo;deep down&rsquo; words of current
theories have meant all along, despite appearances &lsquo;on the
surface&rsquo;.&rdquo; Producing comprehensive and satisfactory
nominalist paraphrases is therefore a way to demonstrate that the
apparent commitment of mathematics and science to abstract entities is
<em>merely</em> apparent. Each stance takes the production of
nominalist theories that avoid ontological commitment to abstract
entities as significant; however, they differ over what the aim of
these &ldquo;nominalistic construals&rdquo; ought to be (Burgess 1998,
Leng 2010, Colyvan 2006).</p>

<p>
Nominalists who accept what is often called Meinongianism aim to
preserve abstract discourse and its truth but reject certain theses
regarding language and ontology (see Routley 1980 [2018]: 14; and
Priest 2005: vii, 134&ndash;155). For those who accept the Quinean
view of ontological commitment, the domains of what there is and of
what exists are coextensive, so, of necessity, there are no objects
that do not exist (see the entry on
 <a href="../ontological-commitment/">ontological commitment</a>).
 In opposition, Meinongians assert that there are objects that do not
exist (see Meinong 1904 and Parsons 1980, and the entry on
 <a href="../nonexistent-objects/">nonexistent objects</a>).
 When implemented by nominalists, the Meinongian approach permits the
positing of nonexistent entities as referents of singular terms and
the values of variables and, in turn, upholds the truth of claims like
(1)&ndash;(3) even while denying that abstract entities actually
exist. The Meinongian tradition has received comparatively limited
discussion as a specific tool for would-be nominalists. This is
perhaps because nonexistent objects are subject to some of the same
metaphysical objections as abstract entities.</p>

<p>
It also remains contentious how to distinguish Meinongian approaches
from other views that reject the Quinean criterion of ontological
commitment. (For discussion, see Lewis 1990.) For example, Azzouni
(2004, 2010) defends a non-Meinongian version of nominalism premised
upon the rejection of Quinean views regarding ontological commitment.
On the resulting view, only concrete objects <em>really</em> exist
despite the apparent truth of claims within mathematics and fiction
and the apparent reference to and quantification over numbers and
fictional characters. In developing this view, Azzouni defends a
distinction between the &ldquo;quantifier commitments&rdquo; and
&ldquo;existential commitments&rdquo; of a theory. While claims like
(1)&ndash;(3) are true and have numbers, theorems, and characters
among their quantifier commitments, it is a further question whether
such entities exist and what, if any, existential commitments and
hence ontological consequences such claims have.</p>

<p>
Related approaches posit distinct meanings of quantifiers and cognate
expressions, only some of which are privileged for the purposes of
ontology. So, if our concerns are metaphysical in kind (e.g., when we
debate the existence of abstract entities), nominalists hold that
claims like (1)&ndash;(3) prove false on this privileged
interpretation. However, in ordinary contexts, claims like
(1)&ndash;(3) are true and this is because of a
non-ontologically-committing meaning associated with the relevant
quantifiers and cognate expressions. Roughly speaking, when
(1)&ndash;(3) are ordinarily used they incur no metaphysical
consequences and are therefore consistent with the truth of
nominalism. But, if asserted in metaphysical contexts and thus
expressing their privileged, ontologically committal meanings, they
are incompatible with nominalism and entail the truth of
anti-nominalism (Hofweber 2005, Sider 2011, Dorr 2008, Korman
2015).</p>

<p>
Our final general nominalist strategy requires no distinctive semantic
machinery and seeks to uphold abstract discourse as meaningful, true,
intended literally, and committed to no abstract entities. It is,
however, the least specific in content and is closer to a promissory
note in theory development or a disposition towards certain
metaphysical options. According to what we will call
<em>concretism</em>, the nominalist simply holds that, on the final
analysis, any of the putatively abstract entities relevant to claims
like (1)&ndash;(3) will turn out to be a concrete entity. Concretism
obviously requires plausibly developing the relevant theories of
numbers, properties, musical works, and so on. Generally speaking,
however, the prospects for these views are likely to depend upon
having a sufficiently expansive ontology of concrete entities or a
sufficiently rich ideology of theoretical concepts. For example, modal
realists like Lewis (1986) have sought to analyze discourse about
possibilities via concrete entities in the form of a vast ontology of
concrete, merely possible worlds. Subsequent efforts have sought to
show that this ontology of concrete entities is sufficient for also
providing a nominalist theory of some mathematical entities in terms
of sums and pluralities of concrete entities and, potentially in turn,
providing an account of properties and propositions (see Nolan 2002:
151&ndash;174). How concretism, when paired with realism about merely
possible entities, ultimately compares to anti-nominalism is an open
question.</p>

<h3 id="NomAccQuaNat">4.2 Nominalist Accounts of Qualitative Natures</h3>

<p>
The preceding section considered how nominalists about abstract
entities might develop theories in the absence of ontological
commitment to numbers, propositions, fictionalia, and other putative
abstracta. As we have noted, nominalists about universals are more
specific in their exclusionary thesis: they reject universals, but
they may nevertheless accept that there are properties and, on some
views, the properties they posit the existence of are also abstract
entities&mdash;e.g., tropes or sets of individuals. The debate between
defenders of universals and competing theorists of qualitative natures
is wide-ranging, but in this section we examine those versions of
nominalism that reject qualitative natures altogether. As noted in
Section One, we take such views to be versions of what we call
&ldquo;strict nominalism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Strict nominalists face an especially broad metaphysical challenge.
The reason why is clear: what we will call &ldquo;property
discourse&rdquo; is immensely wide-ranging. For it is intuitive to
suppose that every object either qualitatively resembles or varies
from every other. Correspondingly, everything seems to be a potential
subject of descriptive classification. By contrast, it is certainly
<em>not</em> intuitive to hold that every object is, say,
mathematical, non-actual, fictional, or musical. Thus, while not
everything is such that our discourse about it prima facie indicates
that there are numbers or (mere) possibilities or creative works,
plausibly <em>everything</em> is such that our discourse about it
indicates that there are qualitative natures.</p>

<p>
The key task for the strict nominalist, which will be the focus of
this section, is to develop a strategy for explaining property
discourse without invoking qualitative natures. The issue at hand
concerns not just first-order predicative discourse like &ldquo;That
apple is red&rdquo;, but also discourse about similarity between
objects (&ldquo;That apple and my house are both red&rdquo;),
explanatory discourse (&ldquo;I bought the apples because
they&rsquo;re red&rdquo;), and higher-order discourse about properties
themselves (&ldquo;Red is a color&rdquo;), which can get increasingly
complicated when descriptive designation and gradient similarity are
invoked (&ldquo;The color of Bob&rsquo;s favorite fruit is more like
the color of my most expensive possession than it is like the color of
yours&rdquo;). The challenge of accounting for such discourse has been
cited by a variety of pro-qualitative-nature theorists as the basis
for assessing the prospects of strict nominalism (see, for example,
Jackson 1977, Armstrong 1978, Campbell 1990, and Yi 2018).</p>

<p>
Of course, the breadth of the challenge does not by itself tell us
whether it can be met, and strict nominalists have generated a rich
variety of proposals for how to do so. Below we introduce several
species of strict nominalism about properties, each of which eschew
commitment to qualitative natures, and then briefly note the
complexity involved in pairing them with the general nominalist
strategies. The objective will be to supply an introductory glimpse of
the issues, rather than an exhaustive guide.</p>

<p>
Strict nominalisms about properties include <em>austere</em>,
<em>class</em>, <em>predicate</em>, <em>concept</em>,
<em>resemblance</em>, <em>metalinguistic</em>, <em>causal</em>,
<em>mereological</em>, <em>reistic</em>, <em>second-order</em>, and
<em>grounding</em> nominalism. The taxonomy of these positions is
complicated, since some occupants of this theoretical space partially
overlap and the relevant literature&rsquo;s terminology is not
uniform. The present survey is organized around the guiding question
of whether the form of nominalism at hand supplies a stock of entities
eligible to populate the extension of predicates like
&ldquo;property&rdquo;, &ldquo;feature&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;attribute&rdquo; although none of these views accept
qualitative natures, understood as sui generis posits required to
explain variety and resemblance (e.g. universals, tropes, or
constructions therefrom).</p>

<p>
We count five strict nominalisms as furnishing candidate members for
the extension of &ldquo;property&rdquo;, while still eschewing
qualitative natures. These are class, mereological, reistic, causal,
and grounding nominalisms, respectively.</p>

<p>
<em>Class nominalism</em> holds that the metaphysical structure of
class membership is necessary and sufficient to explain the
qualitative status of concrete particular objects, like apples and
fire engines. (We assume here that &ldquo;classes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sets&rdquo; can be used interchangeably.) It says that
properties are nothing more than classes of their instances, where
&ldquo;instances&rdquo; of properties are concrete particular objects,
not tropes. For example, the class nominalist holds that there is
redness, but that it just is the class of red objects, or&mdash;on
certain versions of the view&mdash;the class of metaphysically
possible red objects (see Quinton 1957, Lewis 1983).</p>

<p>
Other strict nominalisms focus not on classes of ordinary concrete
particular objects, but on individual non-ordinary objects. According
to <em>mereological nominalism</em>, properties are mereological
fusions of their instances with &ldquo;instances&rdquo; understood as
concrete particular objects, rather than tropes. On such a view,
redness is the fusion of all (or all metaphysically possible (red))
stop signs, ripe strawberries, Santa suits, etc. (Zemach 1982,
Effingham 2020). According to <em>reistic</em> <em>nominalism</em>,
which is based on work by Franz Brentano, qualitative variation is
metaphysically governed by spatially overlapping concrete particular
objects of a much finer qualitatively classifiable grain than ordinary
objects like apples (see Kriegel 2015 and the entry on
 <a href="../reism/">reism</a>).
 For example, the view distinguishes the-apple-qua-red from
the-apple-qua-round, and holds that the existence of the former (but
not the latter) explains that the apple is red.</p>

<p>
<em>Causal nominalism</em> is the thesis that the existence and nature
of properties is determined by particular concrete objects&rsquo;
causal profiles (where causal profiles are not reified in any property
realist sense), as opposed to those causal profiles being somehow
explained by primitive qualitative natures (Whittle 2009; see also
Tugby 2013). Precisely what kind of entity this view takes as the
extension of &ldquo;property&rdquo; is an interesting question. What
is clear is that the identity of an arbitrary property is determined
by particular concrete objects&rsquo; causal profiles.</p>

<p>
<em>Grounding nominalism</em> bases the nominalistic project on
fundamentality rather than existence, contending that properties are
derivative entities grounded in comparatively-more-fundamental
concrete particular individuals (see Imaguire 2018 and Schulte 2019).
Whether (and in what ways) the view thereby differs substantially from
other forms of strict nominalism is an interesting open question. On
one precisification, the relevant grounded entities just are
qualitative natures, albeit non-fundamental ones, but other
conceptually possible versions identify derivative properties with
constructions from concrete particular objects.</p>

<p>
Among those versions of strict nominalism that do not posit entities
that serve as the extension of &ldquo;property&rdquo; and similar
predicates are austere, predicate, concept, and metalinguistic
nominalisms.</p>

<p>
The key idea behind <em>austere nominalism</em>&mdash;sometimes called
&lsquo;ostrich&rsquo; nominalism (originally a pejorative jab by
Armstrong 1978)&mdash;is that no underlying metaphysical structure is
needed in order to explain that individuals are qualitatively
classifiable, for example, that a stop sign or an apple is red, or
that both are (equally) red (see Quine 1948, Devitt 1980, Van Cleve
1994, Parsons 1999, Imaguire 2014). In the standard austere case, this
is in part because no metaphysical explanation whatsoever of
qualitative classification is thought to be needed.</p>

<p>
<em>Predicate</em> and <em>concept nominalism</em> assert that objects
warrant qualitative classification just in case&mdash;and
<em>because</em>&mdash;certain predicates or concepts, respectively,
apply to them, where the relevant application conditions do not invoke
any mind-independent entities that might play the role of a
&ldquo;property&rdquo; (Searle 1969). The chief difference between
these two versions of nominalism is that predicates are linguistic
while concepts are mental. But both versions are typically taken to
treat the metaphysics of properties as a mind-dependent issue, since
predicates and concepts are both mind-dependent. (Note: Searle (1969)
says that there <em>are</em> properties; however, he treats this as
equivalent to holding that predicates have meanings.)</p>

<p>
<em>Metalinguistic nominalism</em> (here following the terminology of
Loux 2002) says that discourse seeming to refer to properties is best
construed metalinguistically, as being about language itself (Carnap
1934, Sellars 1963). Roughly, an utterance of &lsquo;the apple is
red&rsquo; says not that the apple has some non-linguistic qualitative
status, but rather that it (or perhaps the description &lsquo;the
apple&rsquo;) is related in a certain way to the predicate
&lsquo;red.&rsquo; One useful upshot is an interesting paraphrase
scheme for higher-order talk of properties, whereby, for example,
&lsquo;red is a color&rsquo; becomes a claim about &lsquo;red&rsquo;
being a color predicate. Predicate nominalism and metalinguistic
nominalism overlap in certain ways, and the former can potentially be
construed as a species of the latter although versions of these views
(e.g. Searle 1969 and Sellars 1963) differ in significant details.</p>

<p>
Resemblance and second-order nominalism are more complicated with
respect to whether they provide entities as semantic values of
&ldquo;property.&rdquo; Resemblance nominalism says that qualitative
classification is governed by primitive resemblance facts (even if
there is, strictly speaking, no resemblance relation), rather than
resemblance being explanatorily dependent on qualitative natures
(Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002). Thus the view can be developed to allow for
entities that fall under the extension of &ldquo;property&rdquo;,
namely, classes of concrete particular objects that satisfy the
relevant resemblance conditions. Alternatively, since the view makes
no special theoretical appeal to such classes, it can also be
developed to eschew properties and &ldquo;property&rdquo; talk
entirely.</p>

<p>
Finally, second-order nominalism treats predication as its central
concern in the metaphysics of properties and examines it through the
lens of second-order quantification into predicate position (Jones
2018, Trueman 2020). (Note: &ldquo;is&rdquo; takes its predicative use
in locutions like &ldquo;<em>x</em> is F&rdquo; throughout this
paragraph.) Second-order nominalism says that if some first-order
individual <em>x</em> is F (for some predicate &ldquo;F&rdquo;), then
there is something Y, in the second-order sense of &ldquo;there
is&rdquo;, such that: (i) <em>x</em> is Y, and (ii) whenever any first
order individual <em>z</em> is Y, <em>z</em> is F (Jones 2018). The
view is a version of strict nominalism insofar as it eschews
qualitative natures, but it may be considered a kind of
&ldquo;nominalist realism&rdquo;, following Jones 2018, depending on
how one reads the existential commitments of second-order quantifiers.
It may also count as allowing entities eligible to populate the
extensions of some &ldquo;property&rdquo;-like higher-order
predicates. It is a further question whether any such predicate may be
more (or less) metaphysically perspicuous than English predicates like
&ldquo;property&rdquo; and &ldquo;attribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
As the above survey indicates, the emphasis and details of general
nominalist strategies and property-specific versions of nominalism can
vary substantially. Assessing the relationships between these kinds of
views remains an area of significant further study for nominalists. It
is tempting, for instance, to view strict nominalist theories which
offer extensions for &ldquo;property&rdquo; like classes or
mereological sums as well-positioned to pursue the
&ldquo;replacement&rdquo; of discourse apparently about qualitative
natures in ontologically leaner terms. Alternatively, more radical
versions of strict nominalism, according to which there are no
entities within the extension of &ldquo;property&rdquo;, may be easier
to reconcile with general nominalist strategies on which much of our
qualitative discourse is non-literal or figurative in character. We
should be careful not to assume that these positions line up so
conveniently, however. Quine, for example, was certainly not a
fictionalist, figuralist, or non-cognitivist about qualitative
predication, despite being the leading austere nominalist (Quine
1980). Among other things, the prospects for any such views will
depend on the posited connections and affinities between the
theoretical roles claimed for properties and other putative abstracta
like propositions. (On unified conceptions of abstracta, see Zalta
1983 and Fine 1977.)</p>

<p>
On the flipside, we should also exercise caution before simply
assuming that, say, class or mereological nominalists cannot be or
ought not to be, say, fictionalists or figuralists about property
discourse. While to our knowledge actual class and mereological
nominalists <em>do</em> take talk of &ldquo;properties&rdquo;
literally to be about classes or fusions of objects, one could develop
a version of those metaphysical theses that treated classes or
fusions, respectively, rather like fictionalists might treat the
concrete materials constitutive of tokens of novels or films&mdash;the
pages and the celluloid. On this imagined view, property discourse is
fictional, and the pertinent materials we distinctively interact with
in learning and engaging in the fiction are classes (or fusions) of
concrete individual objects.</p>
