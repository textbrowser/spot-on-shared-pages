<h1>Abilities</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jan 26, 2010; substantive revision Tue Apr 22, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In the accounts we give of one another, claims about our
<em>abilities</em> appear to be indispensable. Some abilities are so
widespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the
ability to walk, or to write one&rsquo;s name, or to tell a hawk from
a handsaw. Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the
ability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or
to tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe
such abilities to one another we have the impression that we are
making claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least
sometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards
giving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at
least at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or
outright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to
say what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the
appearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name
&lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; insofar as it gives an account, not of
this or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally.</p>

<p>
This article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,
states a framework for discussing philosophical theories of ability.
Section 1 will say more about the distinction between abilities and
other powers of agents and objects. Section 2 will make some formal
distinctions that are helpful for framing any theory of ability. The
second part, Sections 3 and 4, surveys theories of ability that have
been defended in the philosophical literature. Section 3 concerns the
most prominent kind of theory, on which abilities are to be understood
in terms of a hypothetical relating an agent&rsquo;s actions to her
volitions. Section 4 concerns theories that are not hypothetical in
this way. The third part, Section 5, turns to two significant
applications of a theory of ability. This section considers what role
such a theory can play in the free will debates and in giving an
account of disability. Debates about free will often involve claims
about agents&rsquo; abilities, and many have hoped that getting
clearer on abilities themselves could resolve, or at least shed light
on, such debates. Similarly, some theorists of disability have hoped
that appealing to the notion of ability can help explicate what it
takes to have a disability. The aim of this last section will be to
assess whether these hopes are reasonable ones.</p>

<h2><a id="Tax">1. A taxonomy</a></h2>

<p>
What <em>is</em> an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand
for a <em>theory</em> of ability of the sort described above. On
another reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide
to what <em>sort</em> of things we are speaking of when we speak of
&lsquo;abilities&rsquo;. So understood, this question is not asking
for a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a
theory of ability would be a theory <em>of</em>. This section will
offer an answer to this question on this second, more modest,
reading.</p>

<h3><a id="DisOthPow">1.1 Dispositions and other powers</a></h3>

<p>
It will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to,
but nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.</p>

<p>
Dispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by
predicates like &lsquo;is fragile&rsquo; or &lsquo;is soluble&rsquo;,
or alternatively by sentences of the form &lsquo;<em>x</em> is
disposed to break when struck&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em>x</em> is disposed
to dissolve when placed in water.&rsquo; Dispositions so understood
have figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of science of
the last century (Carnap 1936, 1937; Goodman 1954), and also in
influential accounts of the mind (Ryle 1949). They are like abilities
in many significant respects, in particular in the fact that they are
properties of things that can exist even when not manifested: as a
glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so may a person have
the ability to raise her arm even when she is not raising her arm.</p>

<p>
While dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical
discussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities
inherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are
those that are intimately connected to agency. These include the
susceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways &mdash; such
as the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail &mdash;
that the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances (Gibson, 1979).
These include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of
the kind observed by Thomas Reid: &lsquo;Thus we say, the wind blows,
the sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and
move&rsquo; (Reid 1788/2010, 16; Reid himself regarded these locutions
as &ldquo;misapplications&rdquo; of active verbs, based on erroneous
views of the grounds of powers). Finally, and crucially, these include
the powers of agents themselves.</p>

<p>
In light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a
term that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in
agents. Let us reserve the word &lsquo;power&rsquo; for that general
class. Dispositions, as defined above, are a proper subset of powers
more generally. Affordances, as sketched above, are another one. And
abilities, in a sense still to be defined, are yet another.</p>

<p>
It may yet be that dispositions are especially privileged among the
powers. For instance, they might be more fundamental than the other
powers, in the sense that other powers may be reduced to them. It has
been proposed, for instance, that affordances may be reduced to
dispositions (Scarantino 2003). And we will consider in some detail,
in Section 3.4, the proposal that abilities themselves may be reduced
to dispositions. But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are
simply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has
received a great measure of attention in the philosophical
literature.</p>

<h3><a id="DemAbi">1.2 Demarcating abilities</a></h3>

<p>
Abilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely,
is an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two
additional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an
ability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects.
Abilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not
agents. Objects have dispositions and affordances &mdash; as a glass
is disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid
&mdash; but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is
not, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is
because agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second,
abilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate
agents to <em>actions</em>.</p>

<p>
Some examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some
powers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any
relation to action. Consider the power of understanding language.
Understanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational,
is not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus
the power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present
taxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability,
since it involves a relation to action. (See van Inwagen 1983,
8&ndash;13.)</p>

<p>
So, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that
relates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities,
while serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it
inherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between
actions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain
of action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem
that, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible
that the domain of action will be <em>vague</em>, so that there are
some events that are not definitely actions, but that are not
definitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about
action apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is
right, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in
terms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and
vague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the
theory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For
giving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on
paradigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of
ability.</p>

<p>
Note there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as
distinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active
powers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the
will (Reid 1788/2000). But it is not clear that these distinctions
overlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be
an active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability,
for the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question
of whether willing is itself an action.</p>

<h3><a id="QueKnoHow">1.3 Knowledge how and skill</a></h3>

<p>
Some will expect an account of ability to also be an account of
knowledge how, on the supposition that one knows how to perform a
certain action just in case one has the ability to perform that
action. This supposition, which we may call the Rylean account (since
it is most explicitly defended in Ryle 1949, 25&ndash;61), has been
challenged by intellectualists about know how, notably Stanley and
Williamson (2001). Intellectualists argue that knowing how to perform
an action is a matter of knowing a certain proposition. Stanley and
Williamson&rsquo;s account draws on observations about the standard
treatment of embedded questions (&lsquo;know who&rsquo;, &lsquo;know
where&rsquo;, and so forth; see Karttunen 1977) to defend this idea.
Specifically, they propose that knowing how to <em>A</em> is knowing
that some way is a way for one to <em>A</em>. On this view, then,
knowing how to <em>A</em> is clearly not the same thing as having an
ability to <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>
Authors who reject the Rylean account may nonetheless wish to uphold
one of two weaker Rylean theses. (It bears noting that Stanley and
Williamson reject both.) First, one might defend the Sufficiency
Thesis, which says that ability implies know how. The Sufficiency
thesis is incompatible with the intellectualist claim that know how
requires knowledge of some proposition. Second, one might defend the
Necessity Thesis, according to which know how implies ability. The
Necessity Thesis is compatible with the view that know how requires
(in addition to ability) knowledge of a certain proposition.</p>

<p>
Still, also the Necessity Thesis has been challenged, often by appeal
to cases like the following (adapted from Stanley and Williamson
2001). Imagine a retired ski instructor who is no longer physically
capable of descending the slopes. One might think that it is possible
for the ski instructor to retain their knowledge how to ski even when
they have lost their physical ability. Intuitively, they might still
be able to impart their know how on others. This suggests that know
how does not imply ability.</p>

<p>
A common way for defendants of the Necessity Thesis to respond to
cases like these is to say that whether know how implies ability
depends on our understanding of ability. In particular, if it suffices
for ability that one can perform an act succesfully in some (set of)
relevant circumstances (where these circumstances need not actually
obtain), then there may be a sense in which the ski instructor in the
example retains their ability to ski. It is ability in this sense, the
argument goes, that is implied by knowledge how (for further
discussion see Hawley 2003 and Cath 2019). Another response (developed
in Boylan 2024) is to propose that there are two different readings of
know how claims. On one reading, know how entails ability; on another
it does not. The question then is whether any extant account of know
how can explain both these readings.</p>

<p>
Whatever our view of ability&rsquo;s relation to know how, there is a
further question at the intersection of these topics that bears
consideration: how should we accommodate skills? Skillful action is
often thought to involve a cognitive component. This suggests that
having a skill is closely connected to having propositional knowledge.
In line with this, some authors propose to adopt an intellectualist
account of skill. For instance, Pavese and Beddor (2023) defend the
view that skills are propositional knowledge states. On this view,
knowledge how reduces to knowledge that, and having a skill to
<em>A</em> just is having knowledge how to <em>A</em>. Therefore,
having a skill reduces to having knowledge of some proposition.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, one might suggest that having a skill is best
understood as having an ability that meets certain further conditions.
One oft-mentioned condition that is thought to distinguish skills from
other abilities is that developing and maintaining a skill requires
practice (e.g., McGeer 2018; Robb 2020; Shepherd 2021; Fridland 2021).
Another influential suggestion concerning what sets skills apart is
that their exercise involves &ldquo;strategic control&rdquo; (Fridland
2014, 2021). This is to say that &ldquo;skilled agents are able to
modify, adjust and adapt their practical intentions in ways that are
appropriate, effective, and flexible given their overall goals&rdquo;
(Fridland 2021, p. 5939). This view allows that knowledge of certain
propositions (e.g., &lsquo;it is best to wait with
<em>A</em>&rsquo;ing given my circumstances&rsquo;) plays an important
role in skilled action, without suggesting that skill reduces to
propositional knowledge.</p>

<p>
Ultimately, accurately accounting for the nature of know how, skill,
and their relationship to abilities remains an open and intriguing
problem. For further discussion of the relation between ability and
know how, see the entry on
 <a href="../knowledge-how/">knowledge how</a>.</p>
 
<h2><a id="TwoFunDis">2. Distinctions in ability</a></h2>

<p>
If one wants to give a theory of ability of the sort described at the
outset, it is helpful for that theory to observe some formal
distinctions that have been marked in the literature. This section
canvasses some of the most important distinctions.</p>

<h3><a id="GenSpeAbi">2.1 General and specific ability</a></h3>

<p>
The previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing
abilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be
made within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction
between <em>general</em> and <em>specific</em> abilities
(Honor&eacute; 1964; Mele 2003).</p>

<p>
The distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought
out by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped
with ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it
were, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for
her serving has been met. Such an agent is <em>in a position to</em>
serve, or has serving as an <em>option</em>. Let us say that such an
agent has the <em>specific ability</em> to serve.</p>

<p>
In contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a
racquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is
clearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a
serve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in
the past. Yet such an agent lacks the <em>specific ability</em> to
serve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent
has the <em>general ability</em> to serve.</p>

<p>
The concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense,
and unqualified references to &lsquo;ability&rsquo; should be read in
that way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at
least two reasons.</p>

<p>
The first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant
to the understanding of ability, especially the classical
&lsquo;conditional analysis&rsquo; (discussed in Section 3.1 below),
are naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present
sense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these
proposals within our domain of discussion.</p>

<p>
The second reason is more properly philosophical. If we accept the
distinction between general and specific abilities, then we want for
our account of ability to accommodate both of them, and ultimately to
explain how they are related to each other. For this distinction is
not plausibly diagnosed as mere ambiguity; it rather marks off
something like two modes of a single kind of power. There are at least
two kinds of proposals one may make here. One, arguably implicit in
many of the &lsquo;new dispositionalist&rsquo; approaches to ability
(&sect;3.4), is that general ability is in some sense prior to
specific ability: to have a specific ability is simply to have a
general ability and to meet some further constraint, such as having an
opportunity. Another proposal (suggested in Maier 2015) is that
specific ability is in some sense prior to general ability: to have a
general ability is simply to have a specific ability under a certain
range of circumstances.</p>

<p>
The idea that there is some sort of bipartite distinction to be made
between abilities has been a prominent theme in contemporary work on
ability. It has been endorsed and developed, in different contexts, by
Whittle (2010), Glick (2012) and Vihvelin (2013). However, the
bipartite distinctions introduced by these authors differ from one
another in certain respects. How should we interpret this divergence?
It could be that there exist <em>several</em> bipartite distinctions
and that each proposed view tracks one of these. Alternatively, there
might be a single distinction, so that only one of the classifications
introduced by these (and other) authors tracks a genuine difference
between two modes of ability.</p>

<h3><a id="AbiAbiAsc">2.2 Further distinctions</a></h3>

<p>
Besides the distinction between general and specific abilities,
theorists of ability have proposed several further classifications. In
this section, we discuss three of them. The first, developed by Simon
Kittle (2015) differentiates <em>global</em> and <em>local</em>
abilities. Kittle proposes that abilities can be thought of as
&lsquo;general&rsquo; in two different ways. On the one hand,
abilities can be general in the sense already outlined: these are
abilities that an agent may be said to possess even if she cannot
exercise them given her circumstances. On the other hand, abilities
can be &lsquo;general&rsquo; (we will henceforth use
&lsquo;global&rsquo; to avoid terminological confusion) in the sense
that they can be exercised across a wide range of possible
circumstances. Local abilities, in contrast, can be exercised in only
a narrow range of circumstances.</p>

<p>
Plausibly, the distinction between global and local abilities
isn&rsquo;t binary but indicative of a spectrum: general abilities may
be more or less global. To see this, let us return to the example of
the tennis player who has a general (but not a specific) ability to
serve. Suppose the tennis player is able to hit a serve only in
conditions particularly conducive to playing tennis (e.g., minimal
wind; access to a well-maintained court and racket; no distractions).
The narrow range of conditions in which the agent can exercise her
ability doesn&rsquo;t make that ability specific. After all, the
conditions specified need not actually obtain. But it does make the
ability local.</p>

<p>
Another, arguably more basic distinction is that between
<em>simple</em> and <em>intentional</em> abilities. As Mele (2003)
points out, there is a sense in which agents are able to do whatever
they in fact do. For example, an agent who rolls a six with a fair die
was able (in the simple sense) to do so. Yet there is also another
sense of ability which requires that the agent is, in some relevant
way, in control (though for a recent objection to the view that there
is such a sense of ability see Mandelkern 2024). Mele calls ability in
this more controlled sense an intentional ability. How much control
over one&rsquo;s performance is required to have an intentional
ability is contentious. As in the case of the previous classification,
one might think that the notions of &lsquo;simple&rsquo; and
&lsquo;intentional&rsquo; ability indicate the existence of a gradient
rather than a strict binary distinction: agents may have more or less
control over the performance of an act.</p>

<p>
A third distinction worth mentioning, drawn by Vihvelin (2013), is
that between <em>narrow</em> and <em>wide</em> abilities. Narrow
abilities are abilities that agents possess in virtue of their
internal constitution. Thus, two intrinsic duplicates (governed by the
same laws) have the same narrow abilities. In contrast, wide abilities
are abilities that agents possess in virtue of the combination of
their internal constitution and their surroundings. On first sight,
the narrow/wide distinction might appear to coincide with the
distinction between general and specific abilities. In each case, one
type of ability is possessed only if the agent has the opportunity to
exercise it. However, Vihvelin proposes that an agent who lacks a
narrow ability to <em>A</em> at a given time may nevertheless have a
general ability to <em>A</em>. Such an agent may generally (at most
other times) possess the narrow ability to <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>
While many questions remain about the best way to carve up abilities,
it should be clear that distinctions between different types or senses
of ability are important not just in their own right, but also if we
wish to explicate certain other phenomena by appeal to abilities.
Abilities have been invoked to account for knowledge, concept
possession, free will, disability, and other phenomena. If agents can
possess more than one type of ability, or possess an ability in
various senses, then carefully specifying which type or sense is
relevant will be crucial to appropriately account for these other
phenomena.

 </p>

<h2><a>3. Hypothetical theories of ability</a></h2>

<p>
The bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the
historical and contemporary literature have been what we might call
<em>hypothetical</em> theories. On such views, to have an ability is
for it to be the case that one <em>would</em> act in certain ways if
one were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories
depending on how one understands the volitions in question and how
exactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but
nonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family.
Given their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of
theories of ability with them.</p>

<h3><a id="ConAna">3.1 The conditional analysis</a></h3>

<p>
The most prominent hypothetical theory of ability is what has come to
be called the &lsquo;conditional analysis&rsquo;. In what follows, we
will survey that form of analysis, the problems for it, and
alternatives to it that are supposed to overcome those problems.</p>

<p>
The conditional analysis of ability has at least two aspects. First,
<em>S</em> has an ability to <em>A</em> just in case a certain
conditional is true of her. Second, that conditional has the following
form: <em>S</em> would <em>A</em> if <em>S</em> were to have a certain
volition. The precise form such an analysis will take will depend on,
first, how we interpret this conditional and, second, which volition
figures in the antecedent.</p>

<p>
It has been standard in the literature, when this first question has
been raised, to understand the conditional as a <em>subjunctive</em>
conditional (Ginet 1980), and we will assume in what follows that this
is the best form of the conditional analysis. There has been some
disagreement about whether it is a <em>might</em> or a <em>would</em>
conditional that is relevant (for an account of this distinction, see
Lewis 1973, 21&ndash;24), as well as about which volition is relevant.
In the following, we will take the relevant conditional to be a
<em>would</em> conditional, and the relevant volition to be
<em>trying</em>, though nothing will hang on these selections, and the
points to be raised would apply also to other forms of conditional
analysis, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>.</p>

<p>
We thus arrive at the following form of the conditional analysis:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt>(CA)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> has the ability to <em>A</em> iff <em>S</em> would
<em>A</em> if <em>S</em> tried to <em>A</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If (CA) were true, it would constitute a theory of ability in that it
would say under exactly what conditions some agent has the ability to
perform some action without making reference to the idea of ability
itself.</p>

<p>
The conditional analysis so understood has been subject to a fair
amount of criticism, which will be reviewed in the following section.
It bears noting, however, just how apt an account of ability it seems
at first pass. It satisfies, at least at first approximation, the
extensional constraints: there are many actions with respect to which
a typical agent satisfies the relevant conditional, and also many
actions with respect to which she does not, and these roughly
correspond to her abilities. This imposes a demand even on those who
wish to reject (CA), namely to explain <em>why</em>, if (CA) is simply
false, it so closely approximates to the truth about abilities.</p>

<p>
Its approximate satisfaction of the extensional constraints is also
plausibly a reason why something like (CA) has found so many
thoughtful advocates. It is at least strongly suggested, for example,
by the following remarks from Hume&rsquo;s <em>Enquiry</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
For what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We
cannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives,
inclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a
certain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no
inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For
these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we
can only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the
determinations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,
we may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical
liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a
prisoner and in chains. (8.1; Hume 1748, 72)
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, Hume and many of those who have followed him have been
attempting to do something rather <em>more</em> than to offer a theory
of ability. Hume&rsquo;s intent was to show that disputes over
&lsquo;question of liberty and necessity, the most contentious
question of metaphysics&rsquo; have been &lsquo;merely verbal&rsquo;
(8.1; Hume 1748, 72). Whatever we may think of this striking claim,
however, there is a dialectical gap between it and the alleged truth
of (CA). To anticipate a theme that will be central in what follows,
we must be careful to distinguish between, on the one hand, the
adequacy of various views of ability and, on the other, the more
contentious metaphysical questions about freedom to which they are
doubtlessly related. It is the former that will be our concern in this
section.</p>

<h3><a id="ProForConAna">3.2 Problems for the conditional analysis</a></h3>

<p>
(CA) says that satisfying a certain conditional is both sufficient and
necessary for having a certain ability. There are two kinds of
counterexamples that may be brought against (CA): counterexamples to
its sufficiency, and to its necessity. Let us take these in turn.</p>

<p>
Counterexamples to the <em>sufficiency</em> of (CA) have been most
prominent in the literature. Informally, they are suggested by the
question: &lsquo;but could <em>S</em> try to <em>A</em>?&rsquo; There
are a variety of ways of translating this rhetorical question into a
counterexample. We may distinguish two: global counterexamples,
according to which (CA) might <em>always</em> get the facts about
ability wrong, and local counterexamples, according to which (CA)
might <em>sometimes</em> get the facts about ability wrong.</p>

<p>
Begin with global counterexamples. Let us say that
<em>determinism</em> is true at our world. Familiar arguments purport
to show that, if this is the case, then no one has the ability to do
anything, except perhaps for what she actually does. But if (CA) is
true, then agents would have the ability to perform various actions
that they do not actually perform. This is a counterexample turning on
precisely the kinds of contentious questions about free will and
determinism that, as indicated above, we are for the moment setting
aside. (We will return to the issues purportedly raised by determinism
below in Section 5.1).</p>

<p>
It seems, however, that we can show that (CA) is false even relative
to premises that are shared between various disputants in the free
will debates. This is what is shown by local counterexamples to (CA).
One such example is given by Keith Lehrer:</p>

<blockquote>
Suppose that I am offered a bowl of candy and in the bowl are small
round red sugar balls. I do not choose to take one of the red sugar
balls because I have a pathological aversion to such candy. (Perhaps
they remind me of drops of blood and &hellip; ) It is logically
consistent to suppose that if I had chosen to take the red sugar ball,
I would have taken one, but, not so choosing, I am utterly unable to
touch one. (Lehrer 1968, 32)
</blockquote>

<p>
Such an example shows that (CA) is false without assuming anything
contentious in debates over freedom. It turns rather on a simple
point: that psychological shortcomings, just as much as external
impediments, may undermine abilities. (CA), which does not recognize
this point, is therefore subject to counterexamples where such
psychological shortcomings become relevant. We may, if we like,
distinguish &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; from
&lsquo;non-psychological&rsquo; ability, and claim that (CA) correctly
accounts for the latter (this sort of strategy is suggested, for
example, by Albritton 1985). But our ordinary notion of ability, that
of which we are attempting to give a theory, seems to involve
<em>both</em> psychological and non-psychological requirements. And if
that is correct, then Lehrer&rsquo;s example succeeds as a
counterexample to (CA) as a theory of our ordinary notion of
ability.</p>

<p>
Counterexamples to the <em>necessity</em> of (CA) have been less
frequently discussed (though see Wolf 1990), but they also raise
important issues about ability. Consider a case where a good golfer
misses an easy putt. Given that this golfer tried to make the putt and
failed to, it is false that she would have made the putt if she had
tried to; after all, she <em>did</em> try it and did not make it. But,
as a good golfer, she presumably had the ability to make the putt. So
this seems to be a case where one can have an ability without
satisfying the relevant conditional, and hence a counterexample to the
necessity of (CA).</p>

<p>
Here the defender of (CA) might avail herself of the distinction
between specific and general abilities. (CA), she might say, is an
account of what it is to have a specific ability: that is, to actually
be in a position to perform an action. The golfer <em>does</em> lack
this ability in this case, as (CA) correctly predicts. It is
nonetheless true that the golfer has the <em>general</em> ability to
sink putts like this. But (CA) does not purport to be an analysis of
general ability, and as such is compatible with the golfer having that
sort of ability (an approach very much like this is suggested in Locke
1962). Again, the plausibility of this response will hang on the
viability of the distinction between specific and general abilities.
And, whatever the merits of this response, the objection to the
sufficiency of (CA) remains.</p>

<p>
We appear to be at an impasse. On the one hand, the thought that
abilities are in some sense hypothetical is a deep and persistent
theme in historical and contemporary work on ability. On the other
hand, the simplest development of this thought &mdash; the conditional
analysis (CA) &mdash; appears to face obvious and well-known
counterexamples both to its sufficiency and necessity, even when we
waive the global counterexamples raised by determinism. Which way to
go? We might reject the idea that abilities admit of a conditional
analysis. Or we might give a somewhat more sophisticated conditional
analysis.</p>

<h3><a id="ConAnaSomVar">3.3 Sophisticated conditional accounts</a></h3>

<p>
How might the conditional analysis of ability be made more
sophisticated? Since the conditional analysis is a conditional that
involves a volition, there are at least two ways one might do this.
First, one might be more sophisticated about the nature of the
volition: why do we focus on <em>trying</em>? Second, one might be
more sophisticated about the conditional: what precisely are the
semantics of this conditional?</p>

<p>
Donald Davidson takes the first way, and identifies the choice of
volition in a traditional conditional analysis as the culprit:</p>

<blockquote>
The antecedent of a causal conditional that attempts to analyze
&lsquo;can&rsquo; or &lsquo;could&rsquo; or &lsquo;free to&rsquo; must
not contain, as its dominant verb, a verb of action, or any verb which
makes sense of the question, Can someone do <em>it</em>? (Davidson
1973, 68)
</blockquote>

<p>
Davidson suggests that we may overcome this difficulty at least by
endorsing:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>A</em> can do <em>x</em> intentionally (under the description
<em>d</em>) means that if <em>A</em> has desires and beliefs that
rationalize <em>x</em> (under <em>d</em>), then <em>A</em> does
<em>x</em>. (Davidson 1973, 68)
</blockquote>

<p>
But it is not clear that Davidson&rsquo;s revision in fact answers
objections to the sufficiency of the traditional conditional analysis.
For these objections did not essentially depend on a verb of action
figuring in the antecedent of the analyzing conditional. Consider
Lehrer&rsquo;s case again. It seems true that <em>if</em>
Lehrer&rsquo;s imagined agent has desires and beliefs that
rationalized that action under the description &lsquo;eating a red
candy&rsquo;&mdash;namely, adopting the analysis of Davidson 1963, a
desire for a red candy and a belief that this action is a way of
eating a red candy&mdash;she would eat a red candy. But the trouble is
precisely that, in virtue of her psychological disability, she is
incapable of having this desire, and so cannot perform this action
intentionally. <em>Pace</em> Davidson, the traditional objection to
the conditional analysis seems to turn not on the specific volition
selected but rather on the very idea that ability is to be understood
in terms of a simple conditional dependence of action on the will.</p>

<p>
This brings us to a second way of responding, which is to suggest that
ability instead involves a sophisticated conditional dependence of
action on the will. To begin to develop this kind of approach, we can
ask: what kind of conditional is at issue in CA? Though this point is
not always explicitly recognized, this conditional is a subjunctive or
counterfactual conditional: it concerns what <em>would</em> happen if
an agent <em>were</em> to try. Much of the canonical literature on the
conditional analysis antedates adequate semantics theories of the
counterfactual, notably the Stalnaker-Lewis semantics (Stalnaker,
1968; Lewis 1973). In this way, many of the authors in the tradition
do not even have the formal resources to explore this second way of
responding.</p>

<p>
One recent work that addresses these formal questions is (Mandelkern
et al. 2017). This discussion proposes an &lsquo;act conditional
analysis&rsquo; (ACA) on which an agent <em>S</em> is able to perform
some act <em>A</em> just in case &ldquo;there is some practically
available action such that if <em>S</em> tries to do it, she does
<em>A</em>&rdquo; (Mandelkern et al. 2017, 314). The (ACA) revises the
conditional analysis (CA) by introducing a layer of existential
quantification over modality, and introduces a welcome degree of
formal sophistication into the discussion of ability claims. For
present purposes, however, it bears noting that the authors do not
propose to give a reductive account of what it is for an act to be
&ldquo;practically available&rdquo;, although this is an agentive and
indeed abilitative notion (Mandelkern et al. 2017, 318). In virtue of
what is choosing a candy practically available to me, but not to the
agent described by Lehrer? The authors do not purport to answer the
question, but in this sense their proposal remains incomplete as a
theory of ability.</p>

<p>
Whatever the prospects for this particular proposal, there is a
broader methodological point here that ramifies well beyond (CA), and
indeed beyond the prospects for a conditional analysis of ability more
generally. Any account of abilities owes us, among other things, an
account of ability-ascriptions. This is perhaps true of philosophical
topics generally, but it is true or ability in particular. Even
philosophers who are explicit in their &ldquo;refusal to take language
as a starting point in the analysis of thought and modality&rdquo;
(Lewis 1983, xi) are prone to make explicit appeal to language when
the topic turns to ability, as occurs in (Lewis 1976) or (Taylor
1960). When it comes to ability, it is difficult to even identify the
topic under consideration without using or mentioning certain phrases,
notably &lsquo;can&rsquo; and &lsquo;is able to&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Happily, our understanding of such phrases is steadily improving.
While there has long been considerable philosophical interest in
expressions such as &lsquo;can&rsquo; and &lsquo;is able to&rsquo;,
there is nothing recognizable as a rigorous semantic theory of such
terms prior to the foundational work of Angelika Kratzer, recently
revised and collected in (Kratzer 2012). Kratzer&rsquo;s work has been
central to natural language semantics, and its significance for
philosophical work is still being appreciated. We address the question
of whether Kratzer&rsquo;s semantics might inform a theory of ability
in Section 4, where we consider the modal analysis of ability. Here we
simply note that the question of whether Kratzer&rsquo;s account is
correct as a theory of agentive modals remains an open one. Any
adequate account of ability can be expected to give an account of
ability ascriptions, and therefore needs to attend to this ongoing
debate in the semantics of modal expressions.</p>

<h3><a id="AltHypAcc">3.4 Alternative hypothetical accounts</a></h3>

<p>
If we reject a conditional analysis of ability, we might still give an
account of ability that is broadly &lsquo;hypothetical&rsquo; in
Hume&rsquo;s sense. The guiding idea of hypothetical accounts of
ability is that there is a certain internal relationship between
ability and volition, and that this relationship involves a certain
kind of dependence. The guiding idea, we might say, is that what it is
to have an ability to <em>A</em> is for one&rsquo;s
<em>A</em>&rsquo;ing to depend mostly or entirely on one&rsquo;s
volitions with respect to <em>A</em>. The conditional analysis (CA)
formalizes this insight in a simple way, but it is not the only way in
which this might be done.</p>

<p>
Several authors have revisited the thought that we may give a broadly
hypothetical account of ability, without endorsing the problematic
claim (CA). This is the view of ability that has been defended by
Smith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and Fara (2008). Following Clarke
(2009), we may label this view as the &ldquo;new
dispositionalism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
What unifies the new dispositionalists is that they return to the
conditional analysis of ability in light of two thoughts. The first
thought is one already noted: that there is a variety of power,
dispositions, that is similar in many respects to abilities. The
second thought is that there are well-known problems of giving a
conditional analysis of dispositions, in light of which many authors
have been inclined to reject the long-assumed link between
dispositions and conditionals. Taken together, these thoughts yield a
promising new line on abilities: that though we ought to reject the
conditional analysis of abilities, we may yet defend a dispositional
account of abilities.</p>

<p>
Why ought we reject the conditional analysis of dispositions? Consider
the following analysis of the disposition to break when struck:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt>(CD)</dt>
<dd><em>x</em> is disposed to break when struck iff <em>x</em> would
break if <em>x</em> were struck.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Despite the intuitive appeal of (CD), there appear to be at least two
kinds of counterexamples to it. First, consider a crystal glass that,
if it were about to be struck, would transform into steel. This glass
is disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would
break if struck &mdash; the transformation renders this false. This is
a case of finking, in the language of Martin (1994). Second, consider
a crystal glass stuffed with styrofoam packaging. This glass is
disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would break
if struck &mdash; the packaging prevents this. This is a case of
masking, in the language of Johnston (1992). In light of such cases,
it seems we ought to reject (CD).</p>

<p>
The bearing of these points on our earlier discussion of the
conditional analysis is the following. There appear to be quite
general problems for giving a conditional analysis of powers. So it
may be that the failures of the conditional analysis of ability were
not due to any fact about abilities, but rather to a shortcoming of
conditional analyses generally. One way of overcoming this problem, if
this diagnosis is correct, is to analyze abilities directly in terms
of dispositions.</p>

<p>
Such an analysis is proposed by Fara (2008), who argues:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>S</em> has the ability to <em>A</em> in circumstances <em>C</em>
iff she has the disposition to <em>A</em> when, in circumstances
<em>C</em>, she tries to <em>A</em>. (Fara 2008, 848)
</blockquote>

<p>
The similarity of this analysis to the conditional analysis (CA) is
clear. (Note that other new dispositionalists, notably Vihvelin and
Smith, are sympathetic with the idea that conditionals do in the end
have a central if complicated role to play in the analysis of
dispositions, so their departure from (CA) is in a way less radical
than Fara&rsquo;s.) This raises several immediate questions, such as
whether this analysis can overcome the problem of sufficiency that
plagued those approaches (see Fara 2008, 851&ndash;852 for an
affirmative answer, and Clarke 2009, 334&ndash;336 for some doubts).
But a larger question looms, which is whether the abilities of agents
can indeed be analogized to the dispositions of objects.</p>

<p>
One way of bringing out what is missing is by appeal to the idea that
there seems to be a connection between my abilities, in the sense of
ability that is relevant to free will, and what is up to me. Clarke
claims that this sort of connection fails on the new dispositionalist
view of ability:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although the presence of a fink or mask that would prevent one&rsquo;s
<em>A</em>ing is compatible with having a general capacity (the
unimpaired competence to <em>A</em>), there is an ordinary sense in
which in such circumstances an agent might well be unable to
<em>A</em> &hellip;. If there is something in place that would prevent
me from <em>A</em>ing should I try to <em>A</em>, if it is not up to
me that it would so prevent me, and it it is not up to me that such a
thing is in place, then even if I have a capacity to <em>A</em>, it is
not up to me whether I exercise that capacity. (Clarke 2009, 339)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus the objection is that, while the new dispositionalist has perhaps
offered a theory of something, it is not a theory of ability.</p>

<p>
How should the new dispositionalist respond? One thought is that we
are here again encountering the distinction between general and
specific abilities. The new dispositionalist might contend that, while
the agent described by Clarke lacks the specific ability to do
otherwise, she has the general ability to do otherwise, and that it is
this general ability of which the new dispositionalist is giving an
account.</p>

<p>
Other important recent work has pursued the resources for a broadly
hypothetical account of ability in new ways. Notable here is (Jaster
2020), who defends a &ldquo;success view&rdquo; of abilities, which in
a simplified version holds:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>S</em> has an agentive ability to <em>A</em> if and only if
<em>S</em> <em>A</em>&rsquo;s in a sufficiently high proportion of the
relevant possible situations in which she intends to <em>A</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Jaster&rsquo;s analysis is non-conditional but is nonetheless
hypothetical in the broader sense suggested here. It does not identify
abilities with dispositions, though it shares formal features with
certain treatments of disposition ascriptions, notably, as Jaster
notes, that of (Manley and Wasserman 2008). Along with the other work
cited above, it suggests that the development of some kind of broadly
hypothetical analysis of ability remains a lively and open research
program.</p>

<h2><a id="ModTheAbi">4. Non-hypothetical theories of ability</a></h2>

<p>
A second broad family of theories of ability is
<em>non-hypothetical</em>. Proponents of non-hypothetical accounts
reject the idea that ability is best characterized in terms of a link
between an agent&rsquo;s volitions and actions. The most established
non-hypothetical account, especially within the logic and linguistics
literature, is the <em>modal analysis</em> of ability. According to
the modal analysis, ability claims are possibility claims: claims
about what an agent does in some non-actual state of affairs (or
&lsquo;possible world&rsquo;). We discuss the modal analysis and some
of the challenges it faces in detail below. Besides the modal
analysis, there is a further class of non-hypothetical theories that
has come to receive increasing attention. Theories in this class
differ from the modal analysis in that they do not take ability to be
straightforwardly analysable in terms of what an agent does in some
other possible world. We turn to this new class of non-hypothetical
analyses in &sect;4.4.</p>

<h3><a id="ModAna">4.1 The modal analysis</a></h3>

<p>
Intuitively, claims about ability are tightly connected to claims
about possibility. It is in some sense a truism that someone is able
to perform some act just in case it is possible for her to perform
it.</p>

<p>
To develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for
<em>S</em> to have an ability to <em>A</em> it is necessary, but not
sufficient, that it be possible that <em>S</em> does <em>A</em>. This
claim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of
possibility, such as <em>nomic</em> possibility or <em>practical</em>
possibility. But if we may help ourselves to the idea of possibility
<em>simpliciter</em> (&lsquo;metaphysical possibility&rsquo;), then
this claim appears plausible. (We will survey some challenges to it
below in Section 4.2.) In contrast, it seems implausible that this
sort of possibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of
acts that that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent
might nonetheless not be able to perform.</p>

<p>
This suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability to <em>A</em>
is for it to be possible to <em>A</em> in some <em>restricted</em>
sense of possibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to
the laws of nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative
to what an agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some
independently specifiable set of conditions.</p>

<p>
To render this hypothesis precisely, we may employ the formal
framework of &lsquo;possible worlds,&rsquo; which offers an elegant
and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework, a
proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible
world. We can then say an agent is able to <em>A</em> just in case she
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some
independently specifiable set of conditions.</p>

<p>
We thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt>(MA)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> has the ability to <em>A</em> iff <em>S</em> does
<em>A</em> at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition
<em>C</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a
general family of analyses. Different members of this family will be
distinguished by the different candidates they might propose for
<em>C</em>, as well as whether they quantify over individual worlds or
sets of worlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient
theoretical unity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of
abstraction, as a single approach to the analysis of ability.</p>

<p>
Two points about (MA) bear noting. First, sometimes
&lsquo;modal&rsquo; is used loosely to describe phenomena that are
connected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. The
proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality in a stricter sense: she
proposes that ability may be analyzed in terms of the precise
framework of propositions and possible worlds just adumbrated. The
opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability has something to do
with possibility but denies that any such analysis succeeds.</p>

<p>
Second, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA)
is arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above,
(CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics
for the subjunctive conditional (developed in slightly different ways
in Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973) involve quantification over possible
worlds. Specifically, (on Stalnaker&rsquo;s version) a subjunctive
conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at the world
where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally similar to
the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly equivalent to the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em indent">
<dt>(CA<sub>modal</sub>)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> has the ability to <em>A</em> iff <em>S</em> does
<em>A</em> at a world at which <em>S</em> tries to <em>A</em> that is
otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is patently a version of (MA), with &lsquo;<em>S</em> tries to
<em>A</em> and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual
world&rsquo; serving as condition <em>C</em>.</p>

<p>
If this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis of ability
in the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat
idiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the
program of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations
brought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are
concerned with the general case.</p>

<h3><a id="ModAnaExtAde">4.2 The modal analysis: extensional adequacy</a></h3>

<p>
There are two questions that might be raised for this proposal about
ability. First, does ability indeed admit of some kind of modal
analysis? Second, if it does, how exactly are we to spell out the
details of that analysis &mdash; in particular, how are we to
articulate condition C? Let us begin with the first, more basic,
question.</p>

<p>
According to (MA), performing an act at some possible world (or set of
worlds) is both necessary and sufficient for having the ability to
perform that act. One way of challenging this claim is to deny the
necessity claim: that is, to argue that it is sometimes the case that
an agent is able to perform an act that she does not perform at any
possible world.</p>

<p>
This is an argument that has in fact been made by several authors.
Descartes, for one, appears to have argued that God is such an agent
(Curley 1984). A genuinely omnipotent being, one might argue, should
be able to perform any act whatsoever, even the impossible ones. This
view of omnipotence is contentious, but it is not clear that it should
be ruled out formally, by the very analysis of ability, as (MA) does.
Spencer (2017) argues that even non-omnipotent agents may sometimes
have the ability to perform acts that they do not perform at any
possible world.</p>

<p>
Let us grant, however, that the possibility of performing an act is a
necessary condition for performing that act, and that in this sense an
attribution of ability entails a possibility claim. Another way to
object to (MA) would be to challenge the sufficiency claim.
Specifically, one might question whether there is any specification of
<em>C</em> such that every agent who does <em>A</em> at a world (or
set of worlds) that satisfies <em>C</em> is able to <em>A</em>. Before
addressing this question, let us briefly review some proposed
articulations of <em>C</em>.</p>

<p>
To begin with, one might suggest that what an agent is able to do just
is what is possible for her to do relative to the past and the laws of
nature (van Inwagen 1983), or else what is possible relative to all
agential-level facts (but not all physical-level facts) (List 2014).
In each case, condition <em>C</em> specifies that relevant worlds
share some of their features with the actual world. Note that the
above specifications aim to capture in the first place what it takes
to have a specific ability. General ability would seem to require a
rather different analysis.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, on a seminal account introduced by Lewis (1976) and
refined in Kratzer&rsquo;s treatment of &lsquo;can&rsquo; (1977, 1981,
2012), <em>C</em> is contextually determined. This is to say that
whether a statement of the form &lsquo;<em>S</em> has the ability to
<em>A</em>&rsquo; is true depends on the context in which it is made.
To illustrate this point, consider the following example. Suppose that
it is possible for Jane to ride her bike given various stable facts
about her internal constitution, but not given the fact that her bike
was stolen. On the contextualist specification of (MA), whether these
facts about Jane and her environment suffice to say that she has the
ability to ride her bike depends on the precise fact about Jane the
ability claim is meant to pick out. In some contexts, we are concerned
with what Jane is able to do (almost) precisely as things stand. In
others, we care about what she can do quite generally, independently
of whether she has access to the right resources. Condition <em>C</em>
differs depending on these interests. An advantage of this approach is
that it can be employed to provide truth conditions for general and
specific ability claims alike.</p>

<p>
Regardless of its appeal as a semantics for ability ascriptions, one
might be skeptical of the promise of this contextualist version of
(MA) as an analysis of ability in the material mode. In particular,
while it may seem plausible that ability claims expressed in different
contexts track different features of an agent, one might think it
<em>im</em>plausible that an agent&rsquo;s possession of abilities
associated with those features depends, metaphysically speaking, on
the interests of speakers in some context.</p>

<p>
Returning now to whether (MA) provides a sufficient condition for
ability, some theorists have argued that there is no possible
specification of <em>C</em> such that every agent who
<em>A&rsquo;</em>s at a world that satisfies <em>C</em> is able to
<em>A</em>. For instance, Schwarz (2020, see also Willer 2021)
proposes that no particular specification of <em>C</em> guarantees
that the agent&rsquo;s <em>A</em>ing is, in the right way, under their
control. Put differently, it being possible (relative to some set of
facts) that an agent <em>A</em>&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t seem to ensure
that the agent can actively bring it about that they <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>
Since there are countless possible specifications of <em>C</em>,
showing definitively that (MA) cannot provide a sufficient condition
for ability is a difficult task. Still, the objection points to a
broader concern: <em>even if</em> we can specify <em>C</em> such that
(MA) delivers a sufficient condition for ability, it remains to be
seen whether this can be achieved without appeal to some other
agentive modal notion in the process (for discussion see Maier 2015).
Suppose, for example, that for (MA) to specify a sufficient condition,
the relevant restriction can only be formulated as follows: &lsquo;for
<em>S</em> to be able to <em>A</em> is for it to be possible that
<em>S</em> <em>A</em>&rsquo;s relative to what is within
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s power to do&rsquo;. Since this version of (MA)
appeals to the ability-adjacent notion of what is within an
agent&rsquo;s power to do, it arguably fails to provide a reductive
analysis of ability in terms of <em>S</em>&rsquo;s <em>A</em>ing at
some (set of) possible world(s).</p>

<h3 id="ModAnaLogCon">4.3 The modal analysis: logical considerations</h3>

<p>
A different way to resist the view that ability admits of a modal
analysis is developed in a prescient discussion by Anthony Kenny
(Kenny 1975; the presentation of Kenny here is indebted to the
discussion in Brown 1988). Kenny argues that, if something like (MA)
is indeed true, then ability should obey the principles that govern
the possibility operator in standard modal logics. Kenny claims that
ability fails to satisfy the following two principles:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>\(A \to \Diamond A.\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Informally, (1) expresses the principle that if an agent performs an
action, then she has the ability to perform this action. This is,
Kenny argues, false of ability.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>\(\Diamond(A \lor B) \to (\Diamond A \lor \Diamond B).\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Informally, (2) expresses the principle that if an agent has the
ability to perform one of two actions, then she has the ability to
perform either the first action or the second action. This is, Kenny
argues, false of ability.</p>

<p>
Let us begin with (1). Kenny claims that this principle is false in
light of cases like the following: &lsquo;A hopeless darts player may,
once in a lifetime, hit the bull, but be unable to repeat the
performance because he does not have the ability to hit the
bull&rsquo; (Kenny 1975, 136). This kind of &lsquo;fluky
success&rsquo; has been extensively discussed in the philosophical
literature &mdash; perhaps most famously in Austin (1956) &mdash; in
order to make a variety of points. Kenny&rsquo;s insight is to observe
that these simple cases tell against the modal analysis of ability, as
they violate an axiom of many modal logics, namely any system as
strong as the system <strong>T</strong> (for an introduction to
various systems and their axioms, see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A simple response to this point is to deny that <strong>T</strong> (or
any stronger logic) is the correct logic for ability. To deny this is
still to allow for a treatment of ability within the framework of
possible worlds. Notably, the modal logic <strong>K</strong> is one
that fails to validate (1). A natural response to Kenny&rsquo;s first
point, then, is to say that <strong>K</strong>, rather than
<strong>T</strong> or some stronger system, is the correct modal logic
of ability.</p>

<p>
This response is not available, however, in response to Kenny&rsquo;s
second objection. Recall that objection was that (2) is true of
possibility but not of ability. Here the retreat to weaker modal
logics will not work, since (2) is provable on the weakest standard
modal logic, namely <strong>K</strong>. Yet the parallel claim does
not seem true of ability. Kenny gives the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
Given a pack of cards, I have the ability to pick out on request a
card which is either black or red; but I don&rsquo;t have the ability
to pick out a red card on request nor the ability to pick out a black
card on request. (Kenny 1975, 137)
</blockquote>

<p>
This then appears to be a case where <em>S</em> has the ability to
<em>A</em> or <em>B</em> but lacks the ability to <em>A</em> and lacks
the ability to <em>B</em>. So it appears that (2) is false of ability.
In light of this Kenny concludes that &lsquo;if we regard possible
worlds semantics as making explicit what is involved in being a
possibility, we must say that ability is not any kind of
possibility&rsquo; (Kenny 1975, 140).</p>

<p>
To appreciate Kenny&rsquo;s conclusion, it is instructive to work
through why precisely this is a counterexample to (MA). Consider an
agent <em>S</em> who has the ability to pick a red card or a black
card, but does not have the ability to pick a red card or the ability
to pick a black card. According to (MA), <em>S</em> has the ability to
<em>A</em> iff <em>S</em> does <em>A</em> at some world (or set of
worlds) satisfying condition <em>C</em>. Consider the case where (MA)
appeals to a single world, not a set of worlds. If <em>S</em> has the
ability to pick a red card or pick a black card, then by (MA) there is
a world <em>w</em> satisfying condition <em>C</em> where <em>S</em>
picks a red card or black card. Then either <em>S</em> picks a red
card at <em>w</em> or <em>S</em> picks a black card at <em>w</em>.
Then, applying (MA) now in the other direction, <em>S</em> has the
ability to pick a red card or <em>S</em> has the ability to pick a
black card. But that, by assumption, is not the case. Since (MA) is
the only substantive premise appealed to that argument, (MA) must be
rejected.</p>

<p>
Note that this argument turned essentially on adopting the version of
(MA) which appeals to a single world, rather than a set of worlds. So
one way of responding to this objection is by appealing to sets of
worlds in the modal analysis of ability. Modal accounts that appeal to
sets of worlds are &lsquo;non-normal&rsquo; in the sense that they do
not satisfy the axiom <strong>K</strong>, but they remain true to the
letter of (MA) as well as the spirit of modal analyses generally,
insofar as they avail themselves only of possible worlds and
quantification thereover. This type of view has been proposed by Mark
Brown, who argues that, if we take accessibility relations to hold
between a world and a set of worlds, then we may capture talk of
ability within a possible worlds framework that is broadly in the
spirit of standard views (Brown 1988; for recent proposals along these
lines see Kikkert 2022; Storrs-Fox 2023). Views of this type aim to
capture that not just any instance of <em>S</em>&rsquo;s <em>A</em>ing
entails that <em>S</em> was able to <em>A</em>. Instead, an agent must
succeed reliably enough across certain nearby worlds for their
<em>A</em>ing to count as sufficiently controlled.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we may take this point to militate in favor of a return
to hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least on Lewis&rsquo;s
view of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a disjunction follows
from a counterfactual claim without either of its disjuncts following
from that claim (Lewis 1973, 79&ndash;80).</p>

<h3><a id="AltNonAcc">4.4 Alternative non-hypothetical accounts</a></h3>

<p>
The foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of two
orthodox approaches to ability: the conditional analysis (CA), and the
modal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably just a special case.
This raises the question of what a non-hypothetical and non-modal
account of ability and its attribution might look like.</p>

<p>
Since abilities are a kind of power, one natural idea is to analyze
ability in terms of some better understood power. As we have seen in
Section 3.4, this is the route the new dispositionalist takes when she
proposes to analyze abilities in terms of dispositions. However, where
the new dispositionalist subsequently gives a hypothetical account of
dispositions, proponents of other power-based views characterize the
type of power in terms of which they analyze ability in a
non-hypothetical manner.</p>

<p>
A first non-hypothetical analysis of ability as a kind of power can be
found in the work of Barbara Vetter (2013, 2015). On Vetter&rsquo;s
view, to have an ability is to have a certain kind of
<em>potentiality</em>. Both agents and objects may possess
potentialities, and their possession of these potentialities is more
fundamental, metaphysically speaking, than what goes on at other
possible worlds. Unlike traditional dispositions, which involve a
dyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a
glass is disposed to break when struck), potentialities involve a
monadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the
potential to break). On first sight, this makes potentiality
well-suited to account for ability. Abilities, like potentialities,
appear to involve a monadic relation to an act (e.g., I am able to
<em>play tennis</em>). One challenge for this view is that Vetter
takes potentialities to obey the principles of possibility that caused
trouble for (MA) (see &sect;4.3). This means that an explanation of
why ability violates these principles must be sought outside of its
being a kind of potentiality.</p>

<p>
A different power-based view is suggested by Helen Steward, whose work
emphasizes the traditional notion of a &ldquo;two-way power&rdquo;
(Steward 2012, 2020; see also Alvarez 2013). Steward argues that
actions are exercises of two-way powers&mdash; &ldquo;powers which an
agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior
conditions at that moment fixed&rdquo; (Steward 2020, 345). These are
to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their
manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass that breaks
whenever it is struck. Unlike the new dispositionalists on the one
hand and Vetter on the other, Steward sees a fundamental asymmetry
between agents, who are bearers of two-way powers, and mere objects,
who are bearers only of one-way powers. It is natural then to think
that what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a
certain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an
account of agency in terms of two-way powers.</p>

<p>
Still other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting
also the thought that having an ability is having some other kind of
power &mdash; be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power.
One such account is developed by John Maier (2018, 2022), who argues
that ability is best understood in terms of options. Roughly, options
are those acts that are open to an agent at a given time. Importantly,
what it takes for an action to be open to an agent is not further
analyzable in terms of quantification over possible worlds. To have a
general ability, according to Maier, just is to have a particular
pattern of options. This view thereby runs counter to many other
accounts of ability, including new dispositionalist views and
Vetter&rsquo;s potentiality-based account, which take general
abilities to be fundamental.</p>

<p>
Finally, a fourth type of non-hypothetical account might be gleaned
from Lewis&rsquo; posthumously published compatibilist account of
abilities. Lewis&rsquo; analysis, roughly, is that <em>S</em> has the
ability to perform an action <em>A</em> just in case there is some
basic action, <em>B</em>, such that (i) doing <em>B</em> would
constitute doing <em>A</em>, and (ii) there is no obstacle to
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s doing <em>B</em>. The problem of giving a theory of
ability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles,
something at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning (see
Beebee et al. 2020 for further discussion).</p>

<p>
It is something of an open question whether on this proposal,
ultimately, facts about abilities reduce to facts about what happens
at other possible worlds. What <em>is</em> clear is that this
proposal, if it can be understood as a form of (MA) at all, would
constitute a significantly more complex modal analysis than that
suggested by Lewis in earlier work (1976). Lewis&rsquo; proposal is an
inspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it
indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the
problem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding
project. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches
remain available and the project of giving an analysis of ability may
yet be in its early stages.</p>

<h2><a id="NewAppAbi">5. Applying the theory of ability</a></h2>

<p>
Thus far our questions about abilities have been formal ones: we have
been asking what it is to have an ability, without concerning
ourselves with the substantive work that a theory of ability might
have to do. But abilities are in fact central to a range of
philosophical topics. Let us therefore consider some applications of a
theory of abilitiy.</p>

<h3 id="AbiFreWillDeb">5.1 Ability and the free will debates</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most prominent substantive role for a theory of ability
has been the uses to which accounts of ability have been put in the
free will debates.</p>

<p>
Questions about abilities have figured most prominently in debates
over compatibilism. &lsquo;Compatibilism&rsquo; is used in many ways,
but let us understand it here as the thesis that the ability to
perform actions one does not perform is compossible with the truth of
determinism, which we may take to be the view that the facts about the
past and the laws jointly determine the facts about the present and
all future moments, or what we might call compatibilism about freedom
and determinism. Insofar as compatibilism, so understood, has been
explicitly defended, these defenses have often made appeal to theories
of ability, notably the conditional analysis and its variants.</p>

<p>
In our discussion of the conditional analysis, we distinguished
between global and local counterexamples to hypothetical theories of
ability, where the former appealed to the fact that any such theory
would render ability compatible with determinism which, according to
the objector, it is not. These counterexamples are in a certain way
dialectically ineffective: if someone doubts whether determinism is in
fact incompatible with ability claims, these kinds of counterexamples
will not convince her. But compatibilitsts have often been guilty of
what seems to be the opposite mistake. Namely, they have offered
theories of ability which show abilities to be compatible with
determinism, and have argued from this to the claim that such
abilities are indeed compatible with determinism.</p>

<p>
The shortcomings of this strategy are nicely diagnosed by Peter van
Inwagen. After surveying the local counterexamples that arise for
various hypothetical theories of ability, van Inwagen imagines that we
have arrived at the best possible hypothetical theory of ability,
which he labels &ldquo;the Analysis&rdquo;. van Inwagen then
writes:</p>

<blockquote>
What does the Analysis do for us? How does it affect our understanding
of the Compatibility Problem? It does very little for us, so far as I
can see, unless we have some reason to think it is <em>correct</em>.
Many compatibilists seem to think that they need only present a
conditional analysis of ability, defend it against, or modify it in
the face of, such counter-examples as may arise, and that they have
thereby done what is necessary to defend compatibilism. That is not
how I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist
presents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central
premiss, in fact. And premisses need to be defended. (van Inwagen
1983, 121)
</blockquote>

<p>
van Inwagen&rsquo;s point is that, provided the incompatibilist has
offered <em>arguments</em> for the claim that such abilities are
incompatible with determinism&mdash;as, in van Inwagen&rsquo;s
presentation, the incompatibilist has&mdash;the production of an
analysis is as yet no answer to those arguments. For those arguments
are also arguments, <em>inter alia</em>, against the
compatibilist&rsquo;s favored account of ability.</p>

<p>
There are, then, at least two obstacles for the compatibilist who
wishes to appeal to an account of ability in defense of compatibilism.
First, there is the general difficulty of actually giving an
extensionally adequate theory of ability. Now there is also van
Inwagen&rsquo;s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the
incompatibility of abilities and determinism are, <em>inter alia</em>,
arguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the
compatibilist. Taken together, these points seem to pose a serious
obstacle to any theory of ability that is both compatible with
determinism and in accord with our ordinary judgments about what
ability requires.</p>

<p>
One response is to make a distinction between two kinds of
compatibilist project. (Compare Pryor 2000 on responses to
skepticism). One project is to <em>convince</em> someone moved by the
incompatibilist&rsquo;s arguments to retreat from her position. Call
this <em>ambitious</em> compatibilism. For precisely the reasons van
Inwagen gives, it is doubtful that any theory of ability will suffice
for a defense of ambitious compatibilism. There is another project,
however, that the compatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that,
for some reason or other, she herself is not convinced by the
incompatibilist&rsquo;s argument. She is still left with an
explanatory burden, namely to explain, if only to her <em>own</em>
satisfaction, how it <em>could be</em> that abilities are compatible
with the truth of determinism. Here the compatibilist&rsquo;s aim is
not to convince the incompatibilist of the error of her ways, but
simply to work out a satisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us
call this <em>modest</em> compatibilism. This distinction is not often
made, and it is not always clear which of these projects classical
compatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of
classical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points
while still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses
of compatibilism. For it may be that, though a theory of ability is of
no use to the ambitious compatibilist, it has a crucial role to play
in the defense of modest compatibilism about freedom and
determinism.</p>

<p>
Finally, in addition to bearing on questions about freedom and
determinism, a theory of ability can be expected to have something to
say about another issue central to the free will debates, namely the
metaphysical conditions on moral responsibility. Consider so-called
&lsquo;Frankfurt cases&rsquo;. These are cases due to Frankfurt
(1969), where an agent chooses to and performs some action <em>A</em>
while at the same time there is some other action <em>B</em> such
that, had the agent been about to choose <em>B</em>, an
&lsquo;intervener&rsquo; would have altered the agent&rsquo;s brain so
that the agent would have chosen, and performed, <em>A</em> instead.
One question about such cases is whether the agent, in the actual
sequence of events, had the ability to <em>B</em>. Frankfurt&rsquo;s
intuition, and that of most others, is that she did not. Given the
further claim that the agent is nonetheless morally responsible for
doing <em>A</em>, this case appears to be a counterexample to what
Frankfurt calls the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): an
agent is morally responsible for <em>A</em>ing only if she had the
ability to perform some action other than <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>
In recent years, several philosophers &mdash; notably the new
dispositionalists such as Smith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and
Fara (2008) &mdash; have advocated revisiting our judgments about such
cases in light of the theory of ability. As noted in Section 3.4,
these authors suggest that the ability to do otherwise should be
understood dispositionally, as something that persists even in the
presence of certain counterfactual interveners. When applied to a
Frankfurt case, this view seems to imply that the agent in question
does have the ability to do otherwise after all. We might restate the
question raised by these discussions as follows: should
&lsquo;ability&rsquo; in (PAP) be understood as general ability, or
specific ability? If general ability is what matters, then Frankfurt
cases may indeed not tell against (PAP), for the agent retains the
general ability to do otherwise. If it is specific ability that
matters, however, the challenge to (PAP) stands (see also Whittle
2010). This is a vital question for understanding the purported
connection between ability and questions of moral responsibility,
whichever theory of ability we accept.</p>

<h3 id="AbiDis">5.2 Ability and disability</h3>

<p>
An altogether different yet equally important area in which theories
of ability may be thought to take on an explanatory role is the
philosophy of disability. In particular, some authors propose that to
have a disability just is to lack some ability or set of abilities.
Let us call this the <em>ability-based</em> view of disability. If the
ability-based view is correct, then developing an accurate theory of
abilities should help us gain a better understanding of disability
too. As it turns out, several complex issues arise in trying to make
this view precise.</p>

<p>
To begin with, proponents of ability-based views disagree on the
abilities that matter when it comes to disability. On the one hand,
there are views with a central naturalistic component, which take the
relevant abilities to be determined by a species norm. On these views,
to be disabled is to lack an ability to do things that individuals in
one&rsquo;s reference class (e.g., human adults) are ordinarily able
to do (Buchanan et al. 2000, p. 286; see also Boorse 2010). Thus, a
person who is deaf is disabled on this view because they lack the
ability to hear other people&rsquo;s voices, which is something that
most others in their reference class are able to do. On the other
hand, there are evaluative views, which take the abilities that are
relevant to disability to be determined by some political, ethical, or
social criterion. For example, one might hold that the abilities that
matter when determining whether someone is disabled are those we are
entitled to as a matter of justice (Begon 2023), those that are
important for well-being (Nussbaum 2006), or those we are socially
expected to have (Jenkins and Webster 2021). Whether a deaf person is
disabled depends, on these views, on whether they lack abilities that
are relevant given the view&rsquo;s preferred social or political
criterion.</p>

<p>
It bears emphasizing that the distinction between naturalistic and
evaluative ability-based views is not as neat as the above passage may
seem to suggest. Some authors combine elements of each approach. For
instance, one might hold that only the lack of some subset of
species-normal abilities is relevant to disability. Which subset is
relevant may then be determined by political or social concerns.</p>

<p>
Both naturalistic and evaluative approaches have been challenged.
Here, we will focus on two challenges for ability-based view of
disability more generally. The first challenge, raised by Elizabeth
Barnes (2016), is that there are various conditions that we consider
to be disabilities but that do not clearly result in a lack of
ability. Take, for instance, fibromyalgia, a condition that tends to
manifest as fatigue and chronic pain. On first sight, it is not
obvious which abilities a person with this condition lacks. In
response, some have suggested that there <em>is</em> a clear set of
abilities that a person with this condition lacks if we consider
abilities to perform temporally extended actions. Both fatigue and
chronic pain may interfere with one&rsquo;s ability to work a 40-hour
week, for instance (see Gregory 2020).</p>

<p>
A second challenge arises on the common assumption that having
abilities is valuable. If abilities are valuable, and disability
<em>just is</em> a lack of abilities, this would seem to imply that
disability is a &ldquo;bad difference&rdquo; (Barnes 2016). That claim
conflicts with the judgments of many members of the Disability Pride
Movement, who perceive disability as something to be celebrated rather
than as a negative form of bodily difference or a special type of
disadvantage. There are several ways in which proponents of an
ability-based view might respond to this worry. Firstly, some authors
simply insist that disability is a &lsquo;bad difference&rsquo;. In
fact, they argue, this observation helps justify spending resources on
accommodations for disabled people. Secondly, some proponents of
evaluative views claim that lacking socially expected abilities does
not by definition make one worse off, even if it does put one at risk
of marginalization (Jenkins and Webster 2021). Defining disability as
a lack of socially expected abilities may thus be thought to be
compatible with the Disability Pride Movement&rsquo;s celebration of
bodily difference. Finally, one might accept that having abilities is
valuable, yet reject the idea that having <em>more</em> abilities is
always preferable. If having more abilities isn&rsquo;t always good,
then lacking some abilities isn&rsquo;t always bad.</p>
