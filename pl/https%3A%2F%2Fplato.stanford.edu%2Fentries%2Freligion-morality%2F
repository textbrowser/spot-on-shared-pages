<h1>Religion and Morality in Western Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Sep 27, 2006; substantive revision Wed Sep 25, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
From the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy,
religion and morality have been closely intertwined in Western
thought. This is true whether we go back within Greek philosophy or
within Christianity and Judaism and Islam. This entry proceeds
chronologically, seeking to describe the <em>main</em> options as they
have occurred historically. This will make evident that morality and
religion have been inseparable until very recently, and that our moral
vocabularies are still deeply infused with this history.</p>

<p>
The term &lsquo;morality&rsquo; as used in this entry will not be
distinguished from &lsquo;ethics.&rsquo; Philosophers have drawn
various contrasts between the two at various times (Kant for example,
and Hegel, and more recently R.M. Hare and Bernard Williams). But
etymologically, the term &lsquo;moral&rsquo; comes from the Latin
<em>mos</em>, which means custom or habit, and it is a translation of
the Greek <em>ethos</em>, which means roughly the same thing, and is
the origin of the term &lsquo;ethics&rsquo;. In contemporary
non-technical use, the two terms are more or less interchangeable,
though &lsquo;ethics&rsquo; has slightly more flavor of theory, and
has been associated with the prescribed practice of various
professions (e.g., medical ethics, etc.). In any case, this entry will
assume that morality is a set of customs and habits that shape how we
think about how we should live or about what is a good human life. The
term &lsquo;religion&rsquo; is much disputed. Again, we can learn from
the etymology. The origin of the word is probably the Latin
<em>religare</em>, to bind back. Not all uses of the term involve
reference to a divinity or divinities. But this has generally been the
case in the West, where religion can roughly be understood as a system
of belief and practice that accepts a &lsquo;binding&rsquo; relation
to such a being or beings. Conceptions of divinity and of human
relations with divinity are conceived so variously that no essence of
religion is apparent even within Western thought. The ancient Greeks,
for example, had many intermediate categories between full gods or
goddesses and human beings. There were spirits (in Greek
<em>daimones</em>) and spiritual beings like Socrates&rsquo;s
mysterious voice (<em>daimonion</em>) (<em>Apology</em>, 31d1&ndash;4,
40a2&ndash;c3). There were heroes who were offspring of one divine and
one human parent. There were humans who were deified, like the kings
of Sparta. This is just within the culture of ancient Greece. Probably
it is best to understand &lsquo;religion&rsquo; as a term for a group
of belief/practice amalgams with a family resemblance to each other,
but no set of necessary and sufficient conditions tying them together
(see Wittgenstein, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>,
65&ndash;7).</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="AnciGreePhil">1. Ancient Greek Philosophy</h2>

<p>
We can start with the Greeks, and this means starting with Homer, a
body of texts transmitted first orally and then written down in the
seventh century BCE. The gods and goddesses of the Homeric poems
behave remarkably like the noble humans described in the same poems,
even though the humans are mortal and the gods and goddesses immortal.
Both groups are motivated by the desire for honor and glory. The two
groups are not completely symmetrical because the noble humans have
the same kind of client relation to the divinities as subordinate
humans do to them. There is a complex pattern that we might call
&lsquo;an honor-loop&rsquo; (see Mikalson, <em>Honor Thy Gods</em>).
The divinities have their functions (in Greek, the word is the same as
&lsquo;honors&rsquo;), such as Poseidon&rsquo;s oversight of the sea,
and humans seek their favor with &lsquo;honor&rsquo;, which we might
here translate as &lsquo;worship&rsquo;. This includes, for example,
sanctuaries devoted to them, dedications, hymns, dances, libations,
rituals, prayers, festivals and sacrifices. In all of these the gods
take pleasure, and in return they give &lsquo;honor&rsquo; to mortals
in the form of assistance, especially in the areas of their own
expertise. There is a clear analogy with purely human
client-relations, which are validated in the Homeric narrative, since
the poems were probably originally sung at the courts of the princes
who claimed descent from the heroes whose exploits make up the story.
The gods and goddesses are not, however, completely at liberty. They
too are accountable to fate or justice, as in the scene in the
<em>Iliad</em> in which Zeus wants to save Hector but he cannot
because &lsquo;his doom has long been sealed&rsquo; (<em>Iliad</em>,
22: 179).</p>

<p>
It is sometimes said that the Presocratic philosophers come
<em>out</em> of Homer by rejecting religion in favor of science. There
is a grain of truth in this, for when Thales (who flourished around
580) is reported as saying &lsquo;Water is the origin (or principle)
of all things,&rsquo; this is different from saying, for example, that
Tethys is mother of all the rivers, because it deletes the aspect of
narrative or story (Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>,
983b20&ndash;8). When Anaximenes (around 545) talks of air as the
primary element differing in respect of thinness and thickness, or
Heraclitus explains all change as a pattern in the turnings of fire
igniting in measures and going out in measures, they are not giving
stories with plot-lines involving quasi-human intentions and
frustrations (DK 13, A 5, DK 22, B 30). But it is wrong to say that
they have left religion behind. Heraclitus puts this enigmatically by
saying that the one and only wisdom does and does not consent to be
called Zeus (DK 22, B 14). He is affirming the divinity of this
wisdom, but denying the anthropomorphic character of much Greek
religion. He ties this divine wisdom to the laws of a city, &lsquo;for
all human laws are nourished by the one divine law&rsquo; (DK 22, B
114), though he does not have confidence that &lsquo;the many&rsquo;
are capable of making law well. The sophists, to whom Socrates
responded, rejected this alleged tie between human law and divine law
in part because of their expertise in rhetoric, by which they taught
their students how to manipulate the deliberations of popular
assemblies, and so change the laws to their own advantage. The most
famous case is Protagoras (c. 490&ndash;21), who claimed that &lsquo;A
human being is the measure of all things, of what is that it is, and
of what is not that it is not&rsquo; (Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Theaetetus</em>, 152a). Protagoras is not, however, clearly
skeptical about morality or religion. It is true that he claimed he
was not in a position to know either the <em>manner</em> in which the
gods are or are not (another translation is &lsquo;that they are or
are not&rsquo;) or what they are like in appearance (DK 80, B 4). But
at least as Plato (c. 430&ndash;347) presents him, he told the story
that all humans have been given by the gods the gifts of shame and
justice, so as to make possible the founding of cities; this is
<em>why</em> each human is the measure. Even Thrasymachus, in the
first book of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, thinks of justice as
the same thing amongst gods and humans (<em>Republic</em>, 388c). His
view of what this justice is, namely the interest of the stronger, is
disputed by Plato. But the claim that justice operates at both the
divine and human levels is common ground.</p>

<p>
Socrates (c. 470&ndash;399) in one of the early Platonic dialogues
debates the nature of the holy with Euthyphro, who is a religious
professional. Euthyphro is taking his own father to court for murder,
and though ordinary Greek morality would condemn such an action as
impiety, Euthyphro defends it on the basis that the gods behave in the
same sort of way, according to the traditional stories. Socrates makes
it clear that he does not believe these stories, because they
attribute immorality to the gods. This does not mean, however, that he
does not believe in the gods. He was observant in his religious
practices, and he objects to the charge of not believing in the
city&rsquo;s gods that was one of the bases of the prosecution at his
own trial. He points to the spirit who gives him commands about what
not to do (<em>Apology</em>, 31d), and we learn later that he found it
significant that this voice never told him to stop conducting his
trial in the way that in fact led to his death (<em>Ibid</em>.,
40a-c). Socrates interpreted this as an invitation from the gods to
die, thus refuting the charge that, by conducting his trial in the way
he did, he was guilty of theft &ndash; i.e., depriving the gods of his
life that properly belonged to them (<em>Phaedo</em>, 62b). His life
in particular was a service to god, he thought, because his testing of
the wisdom of others was carrying out Apollo&rsquo;s charge given by
the oracle at Delphi, implicit in the startling pronouncement that he
was the wisest man in Greece (<em>Apology</em>, 21a-d).</p>

<p>
Socrates&rsquo;s problem with the traditional stories about the gods
gives rise to what is sometimes called &lsquo;the Euthyphro
dilemma&rsquo;. If we try to define the holy as what is loved by all
the gods (and goddesses), we will be faced with the question,
&lsquo;Is the holy holy because it is loved by the gods, or do they
love it because it is holy?&rsquo; (<em>Euthyphro</em>, 10a). Socrates
makes it clear that his view is the second, though he does not argue
for this conclusion in addressing this question, and he is probably
relying on the earlier premise, at <em>Euthyphro</em>, 7c10f, that we
love things because of the properties they have. (See Hare,
<em>Plato&rsquo;s Euthyphro</em>, on this passage.) But his view is
not an objection to tying morality and religion together. He hints at
the end of the dialogue (<em>Euthyphro</em>, 13de) that the right way
to link them is to see that when we do good we are serving the gods
well. Plato probably does not intend for us to construe the dialogues
together as a single philosophical system, and we must not erase the
differences between them. But it is significant that in the
<em>Theaetetus</em> (176b), Socrates says again that our goal is to be
as like the god as possible, and since the god is in no way and in no
manner unjust, but as just as it is possible to be, nothing is more
like the god than the one among us who becomes correspondingly as just
as possible. In several dialogues this thought is connected with a
belief in the immortality of the soul; we become like the god by
paying attention to the immortal and best part of ourselves (e.g.,
<em>Symposium</em>, 210A-212B). The doctrine of the immortality of the
soul is also tied to the doctrine of the Forms, whereby things with
characteristics that we experience in this life (e.g., beauty) are
copies or imitations of the Forms (e.g., The Beautiful-Itself) that we
see without the distraction of the body when our souls are separated
at death. The Form of the Good, according to the <em>Republic</em>, is
above all the other Forms and gives them their intelligibility (as, by
analogy, the sun gives visibility), and is (in a pregnant phrase)
&lsquo;on the other side of being&rsquo; (<em>Republic</em>, 509b).
Finally, in the <em>Laws</em> (716b), perhaps Plato&rsquo;s last work,
the character called &lsquo;the Athenian&rsquo; says that the god can
serve for us in the highest degree as a measure of all things, and
much more than any human can, whatever some people say; so people who
are going to be friends with such a god must, as far as their powers
allow, be like the gods themselves.</p>

<p>
This train of thought sees the god or gods as like a magnet, drawing
us to be like them by the power of their goodness or excellence. In
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Ion</em> (533d), the divine is compared to a magnet
to which is attached a chain of rings, through which the attraction is
passed. This conception is also pervasive in Aristotle (384&ndash;22),
Plato&rsquo;s student for twenty years. In the <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em>, for example, the words &lsquo;god&rsquo; and
&lsquo;divine&rsquo; occur roughly twice as often as the words
&lsquo;happiness&rsquo; and &lsquo;happy&rsquo;. This is significant,
given that Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical theory is (like Plato&rsquo;s)
&lsquo;eudaimonist&rsquo; (meaning that eudaimonia, happiness or
flourishing, is our final end, that which all people seek, and seek
for its own sake). Mention of the divine is not merely conventional
for Aristotle, but does important philosophical work. In the
<em>Eudemian Ethics</em> (1249b5&ndash;22) he tells us that the goal
of our lives is service and contemplation of the god. He thinks that
we become like what we contemplate, and so we become most like the god
by contemplating the god. Incidentally, this is why the god does not
contemplate us; for this would mean becoming less than the god, which
is impossible. As in Plato, the well-being of the city takes
precedence over the individual, and this, too, is justified
theologically. It is nobler and more divine to achieve an end for a
city than for an individual (<em>NE</em> 1094b9&ndash;10). Aristotle
draws a distinction between what we honor and what we merely commend
(<em>NE</em>, 1101b10&ndash;35). There are six states for a human
life, on a normative scale from best to worst: divine (which exceeds
the merely human on the one extreme), virtuous (without wrongful
desire), strong-willed (able to overcome wrongful desire), weak-willed
(unable to do so), vicious and bestial (which exceeds the merely human
on the other extreme, and which Aristotle says is mostly found among
barbarians) (<em>NE</em>, 1145a15&ndash;22). The highest form of
happiness, which he calls blessedness, is something we honor as we
honor gods, whereas virtue we merely commend. It would be as wrong to
commend blessedness as it would be to commend gods (<em>NE</em>,
1096a10&ndash;1097a15). Sometimes Aristotle uses the phrase &lsquo;God
or understanding&rsquo; (in Greek, <em>nous</em>) (e.g.,
<em>Politics</em>, 1287a27&ndash;32). The activity of the god, he says
in the <em>Metaphysics</em>, is <em>nous</em> thinking itself
(1074b34). The best human activity is the most god-like, namely
thinking about the god and about things that do not change.
Aristotle&rsquo;s virtue ethics, then, needs to be understood against
the background of these theological premises. He is thinking of the
divine, to use Plato&rsquo;s metaphor, as magnetic, drawing us, by its
attractive power, to live the best kind of life possible for us. (This
gives him a defense against the charge sometimes made against virtue
theories that they simply embed the prevailing social consensus into
an account of human nature.) Yet humans cannot live the life of the
gods. For humans, as for all living things, the best state is its own
activity in accordance with the natural function that is unique to
each species. The human function is the soul&rsquo;s activity in
accordance with reason, and this is the activity of the soul in accord
with the virtues that bring the affective capacities of the soul into
harmony with reason&rsquo;s grasp of the good. Aristotle defines
ethical virtue as lying in a mean between excess and defect, and the
mean is determined by the person of practical wisdom (whom Aristotle
assumed would be male). His starting point is with a conventional
account of the virtues such a person displays (such as courage,
literally manliness, which requires the right amount of fear and
confidence, between cowardice and rashness). But the virtuous person
in each case acts &lsquo;for the sake of the noble (or
beautiful)&rsquo;, and Aristotle continually associates the noble with
the divine (e.g., <em>NE</em>, 1115b12).</p>

<p>
There are tensions in Aristotle&rsquo;s account of virtue and
happiness. It is not clear whether the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> has
a consistent view of the relation between the activity of
contemplation and the other activities of a virtuous life, both of
which are portrayed as the soul&rsquo;s activity in accordance with
reason (see Hare, <em>God and Morality</em>, chapter 1, and Sarah
Broadie, <em>Ethics with Aristotle</em>, chapter 7). But the
connection of the highest human state with the divine is pervasive in
the text. If the god does not care about what is not divine (for this
would be to become <em>like</em> what is not divine), the highest and
most god-like human also does not care about other human beings except
to the degree they contribute to the perfection of his own activity.
This degree is not negligible, since humans are social animals, and
their well-being depends on the well-being of the families and cities
of which they are members. Aristotle is not preaching self-sufficiency
in any sense that implies we could be happy on our own, isolated from
other human beings. But our concern for the well-being of other people
is always, for him, contingent on our special relation to them. Within
the highest kind of friendship &lsquo;a friend is another self&rsquo;,
he says, and within such friendship we care about friends for their
own sake, but if the friend becomes divine and we do not, then the
friendship is over (<em>NE</em>, 1159a7). We therefore do not want our
friends to become gods, even though that would be the best thing for
them.</p>

<p>
The Epicureans and Stoics who followed Aristotle differed with each
other and with him in many ways, but they agreed in tying morality and
religion together. For the Epicureans, the gods do not care about us,
though they are entertained by looking at our tragicomic lives (rather
as we follow celebrities on social media). We can be released from a
good deal of anxiety, the Epicureans thought, by realizing that the
gods are not going to punish us. Our goal should be to be as like the
gods as we can, enjoying ourselves without interruption, but for us
this means limiting our desires to what we can obtain without
frustration. They did not mean that our happiness is self-interested
in any narrow sense, because they held that we can include others in
our happiness by means of our sympathetic pleasures. The Stoics
likewise tied the best kind of human life, for them the life of the
sage, to being like the divine reason immanent in nature. The sage
follows nature in all his desires and actions, and is thus the closest
to the divine. One of the virtues he will have is &lsquo;apathy&rsquo;
(in Greek <em>apatheia</em>), which does not mean listlessness, but
detachment from wanting anything other than what nature, or the god,
is already providing. Like the Epicureans, the Stoics had an argument
against any narrow self-interest, but this time based on their
conception of right reason which is directed by the law common to all,
&lsquo;which pervades everything and is the same as Zeus, lord of the
ordering of all that exists&rsquo; (Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of
the Philosophers</em>, VII 88. For the views of the Epicureans and
Stoics about morality and religion, see Julia Annas, <em>The Morality
of Happiness</em>, chapters 5 and 7.)</p>

<h2 id="HebrBiblNewTest">2. The Hebrew Bible And The New Testament</h2>

<p>
The second line of thought to be traced in this entry starts with the
Hebrew Bible and continues with the Greek scriptures called by
Christians &lsquo;The New Testament&rsquo;. Morality and religion are
connected in the Hebrew Bible primarily by the category of God&rsquo;s
command. God is understood on the model of an Ancient Near Eastern
king, whose power is expressed through command, and who is expected to
care for his people by issuing lifegiving laws, by defending the
innocent, and by caring for the weak. In the first chapter of
<em>Genesis,</em> God creates by commanding, for example, &lsquo;Let
there be light&rsquo; (<em>Gen</em>. 1:3). Then, after the creation of
animals, God gives the command, &lsquo;Be fruitful and
multiply&rsquo;, and repeats the command to the humans he creates in
the divine image (<em>Gen</em>. 1:22). In the second chapter God tells
Adam that he is free to eat from any tree in the garden, but he must
not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When Eve and
Adam disobey and eat of that fruit, they are expelled from the garden.
There is a family of concepts here that is different from what we met
in Greek philosophy. God is setting up a kind of covenant by which
humans will be blessed if they obey the commands God gives them. Human
disobedience is not explained in the text, except that the serpent
says to Eve that they will not die if they eat the fruit, but will be
like God, knowing good and evil, and Eve sees the fruit as good for
food and pleasing to the eye and desirable for gaining wisdom. After
they eat, Adam and Eve know that they are naked, and are ashamed, and
hide from God. There is a turning away from God and from obedience to
God that is characterized as a &lsquo;fall into sin&rsquo;. As the
story goes on, and Cain kills Abel, evil spreads to all the people of
the earth, and <em>Genesis</em> describes the basic state as a
corruption of the <em>heart</em> (6:9). This idea of a basic
orientation away from or towards God and God&rsquo;s commands becomes
in the Patristic period of early Christianity the idea of a will.
There is no such idea in Plato or Aristotle, and no Greek word that
the English word &lsquo;will&rsquo; properly translates.</p>

<p>
In the Pentateuch, the story continues with Abraham, and God&rsquo;s
command to leave his ancestral land and go to the land God promised to
give him and his offspring (<em>Gen</em>. 17:7&ndash;8). Then there is
the command to Abraham to kill his son, a deed prevented at the last
minute by the provision of a ram instead (<em>Gen</em>.
22:11&ndash;14). Abraham&rsquo;s great grandchildren end up in Egypt,
because of famine, and the people of Israel suffer for generations
under Pharaoh&rsquo;s yoke. Under Moses the people are finally
liberated, and during their wanderings in the desert, Moses receives
from God the Ten Commandments, in two tables or tablets
(<em>Exod</em>. 20:1&ndash;17, 31:18). The first table concerns the
people&rsquo;s obligations to God directly, to worship God alone and
keep God&rsquo;s name holy, and keep the Sabbath. The second table
concerns obligations to other human beings, and all of the commands
are negative (do not kill, commit adultery, steal, lie, or covet)
except for the first, the command to honor fathers and mothers.
God&rsquo;s commands taken together yield the law (on some lists there
are 613 <em>mitzvot</em>, Hebrew for &lsquo;commands&rsquo;). One more
term belongs here, namely &lsquo;kingdom&rsquo;. The Greeks had the
notion of a kingdom, under a human king, although the Athenians were
in the classical period suspicious of such an arrangement. But they
did not have the idea of a kingdom of God, though there is something
approaching this in some of the Stoics. This idea is explicable in
terms of law, and is introduced as such in <em>Exodus</em> in
connection with the covenant on Mt. Sinai. The kingdom is the realm in
which the laws obtain.</p>

<p>
This raises a question about the extent of this realm. The Ten
Commandments are given in the context of a covenant with the people of
Israel, though there are references to God&rsquo;s intention to bless
the whole world through this covenant. The surrounding laws in the
Pentateuch include prescriptions and proscriptions about ritual purity
and sacrifice and the use of the land that seem to apply to this
particular people in this particular place. But the covenant that God
makes with Noah after the flood is applicable to the whole human race,
and universal scope is explicit in the Wisdom books, which make a
continual connection between how we should live and how we were
created as human beings. For example, in <em>Proverbs</em> 8 Wisdom
raises her voice to all humankind, and says that she detests
wickedness, which she goes on to describe in considerable detail. She
says that she was the artisan at God&rsquo;s side when God created the
world and its inhabitants. Judaism distinguishes seven
&lsquo;Noahide&rsquo; laws given to Noah before the covenant with
Abraham as universal prescriptions.</p>

<p>
In the writings which Christians call &lsquo;The New Testament&rsquo;,
the theme of God&rsquo;s commands is recapitulated. Jesus sums up the
commandments under two, the command to love God with all one&rsquo;s
heart and soul and mind (see <em>Deuteronomy</em> 6:5), and the
command to love the neighbor as the self (see <em>Leviticus</em>
19:18). The first of these probably sums up the first
&lsquo;table&rsquo; of the Ten Commandments to Moses, and the second
sums up the second. The New Testament is unlike the Hebrew Bible,
however, in presenting a narrative about a man who is the perfect
exemplification of obedience and who has a life without sin. New
Testament scholars disagree about the extent to which Jesus actually
claimed to be God, but the traditional interpretation is that he did
make this claim; in any case the Christian doctrine is that his life
offers the clearest possible revelation in human terms both of what
God is like and at the same time of what human lives ought to be like.
In the &lsquo;Sermon on the Mount&rsquo; (<em>Matthew</em> 5&ndash;7),
Jesus issues a number of radical injunctions. He takes the
commandments inside the heart; for example, we are required not merely
not to murder, but not to be angry, and not merely not to commit
adultery, but not to lust (see <em>Ezekiel</em> 11:19, &lsquo;I will
give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes&rsquo;).
We are told, if someone strikes us on the right cheek, to turn to him
also the left. Jesus tells us to love our enemies and those who hate
and persecute us, and in this way he makes it clear that the love
commandment is not based on reciprocity (<em>Matt</em> 5:43&ndash;48;
<em>Luke</em> 6:27&ndash;36). Finally, when he is asked &lsquo;Who is
my neighbor?&rsquo;, he tells the story (<em>Luke</em> 10) of a
Samaritan (traditional enemies of the Jews) who met a wounded Jew he
did not know by the side of the road, was moved with compassion, and
went out of his way to meet his needs; Jesus commends the Samaritan
for being &lsquo;neighbor&rsquo; to the wounded traveler. Jesus
describes the paradigm of loving our neighbors as the willingness to
die for them, and this is understood in the New Testament as
exemplified by Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross. This event is
understood in many different ways in the New Testament, but one
central theme is that Jesus died on our behalf, an innocent man on
behalf of the guilty. This theme is connected with our relationship to
God, which we violate by disobedience, but which is restored by
God&rsquo;s forgiveness through redemption.</p>

<p>
There is an important contrast between the Greek and the
Judeo-Christian traditions. The idea of God that is central in Greek
philosophy is the idea of God attracting us, like a kind of magnet, so
that we desire to become more like God, though there is a minority
account by Socrates of receiving divine commands. In the Jewish and
Christian scriptures, the notion of God commanding us is central. It
is tempting to simplify this contrast by saying that the Greeks favor
<em>the good</em>, in their account of the relation of morality and
religion, and the Judeo-Christian account favors <em>the right</em> or
obligation. It is true that the notion of obligation makes most sense
against the background of command. But the picture is over-simple
because the Greeks had room in their account for the constraint of
desire; thus the temperate or brave person in Aristotle&rsquo;s
picture has desires for food or sex or safety that have to be
disciplined by the love of the noble. On the other side, the
Judeo-Christian account adds God&rsquo;s love to the notion of
God&rsquo;s command, so that the covenant in which the commands are
embedded is a covenant by which God blesses humankind, who are given a
route towards the highest good which is union or friendship with
God.</p>

<h2 id="MiddAges">3. The Middle Ages</h2>

<p>
The rest of the history to be described in this entry is a
cross-fertilization of these two traditions or lines of thought. In
the patristic period, it was predominantly Plato and the Stoics
amongst the Greek philosophers whose influence was felt. The Eastern
and Western parts of the Christian church split during this period,
and the Eastern church remained more comfortable than the Western with
language about humans being deified (in Greek, <em>theosis</em>). In
the Western church, Augustine (354&ndash;430) emphasized the gap
between the world we are in as resident aliens and our citizenship in
the heavenly Jerusalem, and even in our next life the distance between
ourselves and God. He describes in the <em>Confessions</em> the route
by which his heart or will, together with his understanding, moved
from paganism through Neo-Platonism to Christianity. The
Neo-Platonists (such as Plotinus, 205-270) taught a world-system of
emanation, whereby the One (like Plato&rsquo;s Form of the Good)
flowed into Intellect (the realm of the Forms) and from there into the
World-Soul and individual souls, where it encountered the realm of
bodies, from where it returned to itself (&lsquo;the flight of the
alone to the alone&rsquo;). Augustine accepted that the Platonists
taught, like the beginning of the prologue of <em>John</em>, that the
Word (in Greek, <em>logos</em>) is with God and is God, since the
Intellect is the mediating principle between the One and the Many
(<em>John</em> 1:1&ndash;5). Augustine held that Plato had asserted
that the supreme good, possession of which alone gives us blessedness,
is God, &lsquo;and therefore (Plato) thought that to be a philosopher
is to be a lover of God&rsquo; (<em>De Civ. Dei</em> VIII.8). But the
Platonists did not teach, like the <em>end</em> of John&rsquo;s
prologue, that the Word is made flesh in Jesus Christ, and so they did
not have access to the way to salvation revealed in Christ or
God&rsquo;s grace to us through Christ&rsquo;s death. Nonetheless, it
is surprising how far Augustine can go in rapprochement. The Forms, he
says, are in the mind of God and God uses them in the creation of the
world. Human beings were created for union with God, but they have the
freedom to turn towards themselves instead of God. If they turn to
God, they can receive divine illumination through a personal intuition
of the eternal standards (the Forms). If they turn towards themselves,
they will lose the sense of the order of creation, which the order of
their own loves should reflect. Augustine gives primacy to the virtue
of loving what ought to be loved, especially God. In his homily on
<em>I John</em> 4:8, he says, &lsquo;Love and do what you will.&rsquo;
But this is not a denial of the moral law. He held that humans who
truly love God will also act in accord with the other precepts of
divine and moral law; though love not merely fulfills the cardinal
virtues (wisdom, justice, courage and temperance), but also transforms
them by supernatural grace.</p>

<p>
The influence of Augustine in the subsequent history of ethics
resulted from the fact that it was his synthesis of Christianity (the
official religion of the Roman Empire after 325) and Greek philosophy
that survived the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, especially
in the monasteries where the texts were still read. Boethius (c.
480&ndash;524) gave us the definition of the concept of
&lsquo;person&rsquo; that has been fundamental to ethical theory. To
understand this, we need to go back into the history of the
development of the doctrine of the Trinity. The church had to explain
how the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit could be distinct and yet
not three different gods. They used, in Latin, the term
<em>persona</em>, which means &lsquo;role&rsquo; but which was also
used by the grammarians to distinguish what we call &lsquo;first
person, second person and third person&rsquo; pronouns and verb-forms.
The same human being can be first person &lsquo;I&rsquo;, second
person &lsquo;you&rsquo;, and third person &lsquo;he&rsquo; or
&lsquo;she&rsquo;, depending on the relations in which he or she
stands. The doctrine of the Trinity comes to be understood in terms of
three persons, one God, with the persons standing in different
relations to each other. But then this term &lsquo;person&rsquo; is
also used to understand the relation of the second person&rsquo;s
divinity to his humanity. The church came to talk about one person
with two natures, the person standing under the natures. This had the
merit of not making either the humanity or the divinity less essential
to who Jesus was. Plato and Aristotle did not have any term that we
can translate &lsquo;person&rsquo; in the modern sense, as
some<em>one</em> (as opposed to some<em>thing</em>) that stands under
all his or her attributes. Boethius, however, defines
&lsquo;person&rsquo; as &lsquo;individual substance of rational
nature,&rsquo; a key step in the introduction of our present
concept.</p>

<p>
In the West, knowledge of most of Aristotle&rsquo;s texts was lost,
but not in the East. They were translated into Syriac, and Arabic, and
eventually (in Muslim Spain) into Latin, and re-entered Christian
Europe in the twelfth century accompanied by translations of the great
Arabic commentaries. In the initial prophetic period of Islam (CE
610&ndash;32), the Qur&rsquo;an was given to Mohammad, who explained
and reinforced it through his own teachings and practices. The notion
of God&rsquo;s (Allah&rsquo;s) commands is again central, and our
obedience to these commands is the basis of our eventual resurrection.
Disputes about political authority in the period after
Mohammad&rsquo;s death led to the split between Sunnis and Shiites.
Within Sunni Muslim ethical theory in the Middle Ages two major
alternative ways developed of thinking about the relation between
morality and religion. The first, the Mu&rsquo;tazilite, was given its
most developed statement by &lsquo;Abd al-Jabbar from Basra (d. 1025).
&lsquo;Abd al-Jabbar defines a wrongful act as one that deserves
blame, and holds that the right and wrong character of acts is known
immediately to human reason, independently of revelation. These
standards that we learn from reason apply also to God, so that we can
use them to judge what God is and is not commanding us to do. He also
teaches that humans have freedom, in the sense of a power to perform
both an act and its opposite, though not at the same time. (For
Mu&rsquo;tazilite ethical theory, see Sophia Vasalou, <em>Moral Agents
and Their Deserts: The Character of Mu&rsquo;tazilite Ethics</em> and
George Hourani, <em>Islamic Rationalism: The Ethics of &lsquo;Abd
al-Jabbar</em>.) The second alternative was taught by al-Ashari (d.
935), who started off as a Mu&rsquo;tazilite, but came to reject their
view. He insists that God is subject to none and to no standard that
can fix bounds for Him. Nothing can be wrong for God, who sets the
standard of right and wrong. This means that &lsquo;if God declared
lying to be right, it would be right, and if He commanded it, none
could gainsay Him&rsquo; (<em>The Theology of al-Ash&rsquo;ari</em>,
169&ndash;70). With respect to our freedom, he holds that God gives us
only the power to do the act (not its opposite) and this power is
simultaneous to the act and does not precede it. A figure contemporary
with al-Ashari, but in some ways intermediate between
Mu&rsquo;tazilites and Asharites, is al-Maturidi of Samarqand (d.
944). He holds that because humans have the tendency in their nature
towards ugly or harmful actions as well as beautiful or beneficial
ones, God has to reveal to us by command what to pursue and what to
avoid. He also teaches that God gives us two different kinds of power,
both the power simultaneous with the act (which is simply to do the
act) and the power preceding the act (to choose either the act or its
opposite). (For the work of al-Maturidi, see Ulrich Rudolph,
<em>Al-Maturidi and Sunni Theology in Samarkand</em>.)</p>

<p>
Medieval reflection within Judaism about morality and religion has, as
its most significant figure, Maimonides (d. 1204), who was born in
Muslim Spain and was familiar with much of the Muslim discussion of
these questions. <em>The Guide of the Perplexed</em> was written for
young men who had read Aristotle and were worried about the tension
between the views of the philosopher and their faith. Maimonides
teaches that we do indeed have some access just as human beings to the
rightness and wrongness of acts; but what renders conforming to these
standards obligatory is that God reveals them in special revelation.
The laws are obligatory whether we understand the reasons for them or
not, but sometimes we do see how it is beneficial to obey, and
Maimonides is remarkably fertile in providing such reasons.</p>

<p>
Peter Abelard (1079&ndash;1142) represents the height of medieval
Christian ethical reflection prior to the recovery of Aristotle.&nbsp;
Abelard defended a radically intentionalist ethic, according to which
right intention is the sole criterion of the moral worth of an
action.&nbsp; Right intention is secured by the conformity of
intention to the Golden Rule, which is universally accessible through
reason.&nbsp; Abelard argued that both coercion and ignorance removed
blame, and arrived at the controversial conclusion that those who
crucified Christ did no evil, given their false beliefs concerning
Christ&rsquo;s identity and guilt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The reentry of Aristotle into Europe threatened to undermine the
harmony established from the time of Augustine between the authority
of reason, as represented by Greek philosophy, and the authority of
faith, as represented by the doctrines of the Christian church. There
were especially three &lsquo;errors of Aristotle&rsquo; that seemed
threatening: his teaching that the world was eternal, his apparent
denial of personal immortality, and his denial of God&rsquo;s active
agency in the world. (See, for example, Bonaventure, <em>In
Hexaemeron</em>, VI.5 and <em>In II Sent</em>., lib. II, d.1, pars 1,
a.1, q.2.) These three issues (&lsquo;the world, the soul, and
God&rsquo;) become in one form or another the focus of philosophical
thought for the next six centuries.</p>

<p>
Thomas Aquinas (c. 1224&ndash;74) undertook the project of synthesis
between Aristotle and Christianity, though his version of Christianity
was already deeply influenced by Augustine, and so by Neo-Platonism.
Picking up on the Neo-Platonic theme of the exitus and reditus of
creation, Aquinas understood creation as the sharing of divine life
with creatures. While all creatures reflect divine perfection in
diverse finite ways, human beings play a special role in the reditus
of creation, inasmuch as they are capable of free, intentional action,
and so of freely responding to the divine initiative by entering into
friendship with God. Following Aristotle, Aquinas emphasizes the
virtues as intrinsic principles of human action, integrating his
account of the virtues with an account of the law as an extrinsic
principle of human action. Both law and the virtues direct persons to
their final end of friendship with God, through which free human
agency is perfected in alignment with the good. The eternal law is
Divine wisdom, the type or exemplar of ordering to the good. The
natural law is the special mode of human participation in the eternal
law through practical reason, that is, through reflecting on how
natural inclinations (those shared with all creatures, those shared
with other animals, and those special to rational creatures) can be
fulfilled in ways appropriate to being a finite rational moral agent.
Aquinas&rsquo;s theory is eudaimonist, but his eudaimonism has an
ecstatic character. Perfect happiness is found in the knowledge and
love of God, and this love is perfected through charity when God is
loved for the sake of God&rsquo;s perfect goodness, not (as in
concupiscent love) for the sake of the lover&rsquo;s access to this
goodness (see Herdt, <em>Assuming Responsibility</em>, ch. 2). Aquinas
was not initially successful in persuading the church to embrace
Aristotle. In 1277 the Bishop of Paris condemned 219 propositions (not
all Thomist), including the thesis that a person virtuous in
Aristotle&rsquo;s terms &lsquo;is sufficiently disposed for eternal
happiness.&rsquo; Nevertheless, ethical reflection in terms of natural
law and the virtues, understood in close relation to one another,
became the norm through the 17th century for both Catholics and
Protestants. And in the Counter-Reformation, the synthesis which
Aquinas achieved became authoritative in Roman Catholic education.</p>

<p>
Aquinas was a Dominican friar. The other major order of friars, the
Franciscan, had its own school of philosophy, starting with
Bonaventure (c. 1217&ndash;74), who held that while we can learn from
both Plato and Aristotle, and both are in error, the greater error is
Aristotle&rsquo;s. One other major figure from this tradition is John
Duns Scotus (literally John from Duns, the Scot, c. 1266&ndash;1308),
and there are three significant differences between him and Aquinas on
the relation between morality and religion. First, Scotus rejects
Aquinas&rsquo;s ecstatic eudaimonism, according to which concupiscent,
self-centered love is transformed by the love of charity. Instead, he
takes a double account of motivation from Anselm (1033&ndash;1109),
who made a sharp distinction between two affections of the will, the
affection for advantage (an inclination towards one&rsquo;s own
happiness and perfection) and the affection for justice (an
inclination towards what is good in itself independent of advantage)
(Anselm, <em>De Concordia</em> 3.11, 281:7&ndash;10; <em>De Casu
Diaboli</em> 12, 255:8&ndash;11). Original sin is a ranking of
advantage over justice, which needs to be reversed by God&rsquo;s
assistance before we can be pleasing to God. Scotus says that we
should be willing to sacrifice our own happiness for God if God were
to require this. Second, he does not think that the moral law is
self-evident or necessary. He takes the first table to be necessary,
since it derives (except for the &lsquo;every seventh day&rsquo;
provision of the command about the Sabbath) from the necessary
principle that God is to be loved. But the second table is contingent,
though fitting our nature, and God could prescribe different commands
even for human beings (<em>Ord</em>. I, dist. 44). One of his examples
is the proscription on theft, which applies only to beings with
property, and so not necessarily to human beings (since they are not
necessarily propertied). God also gives dispensation from the
commands, according to Scotus, for example the command to Abraham to
kill Isaac (<em>Ord</em> III, suppl. Dist. 37). Third, Scotus denied
the application of teleology to non-intentional nature, and thus
departed from the Aristotelian and Thomist view. This does not mean
that we have no natural end or <em>telos</em>, but that this end is
related to the intention of God in the same way a human artisan
intends his or her products to have a certain purpose (see Hare 2006,
chapter 2).</p>

<h2 id="ModePhil">4. Modern Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Europe experienced a Renaissance when scholars fled Constantinople
after its capture by the Muslims in 1453, and brought with them Greek
manuscripts that were previously inaccessible. In Florence, Marsilio
Ficino (1433&ndash;99) identified Plato as the primary ancient teacher
of wisdom, in harmony with Christian faith. Like Bonaventure, he cited
Augustine as his guide in elevating Plato in this way. He set about
making Latin translations of all the Platonic texts, and was also the
first Latin translator of Plotinus, the Neo-Platonist.</p>

<p>
Many of the central figures in the Reformation were humanists in the
Renaissance sense (where there is no implication of atheism), even as
there is fundamental continuity between medieval Scholastic and
Reformation reflection on natural law and the virtues. There is also a
similarity to Scotus in the way the relation between morality and
religion is conceived by the Reformers Martin Luther (1483&ndash;1546)
and John Calvin (1509&ndash;64), though neither of them make the
distinctions about natural law that Scotus does. Luther says
&lsquo;What God wills is not right because he ought or was bound so to
will; on the contrary, what takes place must be right, because he so
wills.&rsquo; (<em>Bondage of the Will</em>, <em>Works</em>, pp.
195&ndash;6). Calvin says &lsquo;God&rsquo;s will is so much the
highest rule of righteousness that whatever he wills, by the very fact
that he wills it, must be considered righteous&rsquo;
(<em>Institutes</em> 3. 23. 2). This voluntarist connection between
Scotus and the Reformers can be traced through William of Ockham (d.
1349) and Gabriel Biel (1410&ndash;95). The Counter-Reformation in
Roman Catholic Europe, on the other hand, took the work of Aquinas as
authoritative for education. Francisco de Suarez (1548&ndash;1617)
claimed that the precepts of natural law can be distinguished into
those (like &lsquo;Do good and avoid evil&rsquo;) which are known
immediately and intuitively by all normal human beings, those (like
&lsquo;Do no injury to anyone&rsquo;) which require experience and
thought to know them, but which are then self-evident, and those (like
&lsquo;Lying is always immoral&rsquo;) which are not self-evident but
can be derived from the more basic precepts (<em>De Legibus</em>, 2.
7. 5). However, Suarez accepted Scotus&rsquo;s double account of
motivation.</p>

<p>
The next two centuries in European philosophy can be described in
terms of two lines of development, rationalism and empiricism, both of
which led, in different ways, to the possibility of a greater
detachment of ethics from theology. The history of rationalism from
Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596&ndash;1650) to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1646&ndash;1716) is a history of the attempt to re-establish human
knowledge on the foundation of indubitable rational principles, after
modern science started to shake the traditional foundations supported
by the authority of Greek philosophy and the church. Descartes was not
primarily an ethicist, but he located the source of moral law
(surprisingly for a rationalist) in God&rsquo;s will. The most
important rationalist in ethics was Benedict de Spinoza
(1623&ndash;77). He was a Jew, but was condemned by his contemporary
faith community as unorthodox. Like Descartes, he attempted to
duplicate the methods of geometry in philosophy. Substance, according
to Spinoza, exists in itself and is conceived through itself
(<em>Ethics</em>, I, def. 3); it is consequently one, infinite, and
identical with God (<em>Ethics</em>, I, prop. 15). There is no such
thing as natural law, since all events in nature (&lsquo;God or
Nature&rsquo;) are equally natural. Everything in the universe is
necessary, and there is no free will, except in as far as Spinoza is
in favor of calling someone free who is led by reason (
<em>Ethics</em>, I, prop. 32). Each human mind is a limited aspect of
the divine intellect. On this view (which has its antecedent in
Stoicism) the human task is to move towards the greatest possible
rational control of human life. Leibniz, like Descartes, was not
primarily an ethicist. He said, however, that &lsquo;the highest
perfection of any thinking being lies in careful and constant pursuit
of true happiness&rsquo; (<em>New Essays on Human Understanding</em>,
XXI, 51). The rationalists were not denying the centrality of God in
human moral life, but their emphasis was on the access we have through
the light of reason rather than through sacred text or ecclesiastical
authority.</p>

<p>
After Leibniz there was in Germany a long-running battle between the
rationalists and the pietists. Examples of the two schools are
Christian Wolff (1679&ndash;1754) and Christian August Crusius
(1715&ndash;75), and we can understand Immanuel Kant (1724&ndash;1804)
as trying to mediate between the two. Wolff was a very successful
popularizer of the thought of Leibniz. He took from Leibniz the
principle that we will always select what pleases us most, and the
principle that pleasure is the apprehension of perfection, so that the
amount of pleasure we feel is proportional to the amount of perfection
we intuit (<em>New Essays on Human Understanding</em>, XXI, 41). He
thought we are obligated to do what will make us and our condition, or
that of others, more perfect, and this is the law of nature that would
be binding on us even if (<em>per impossible</em>) God did not exist.
He saw no problem about the connection between virtue and happiness,
since both of them result directly from our perfection, and no problem
about the connection between virtue and duty, since a duty is simply
an act in accordance with law, which prescribes the pursuit of
perfection. His views were offensive to the pietists, because he
claimed that Confucius already knew (by reason) all that mattered
about morality, even though he did not know anything about Christ. By
contrast, Crusius accepted Scotus&rsquo;s double theory of motivation,
and held that there are actions that we ought to do regardless of any
ends we have, even the end of our own perfection and happiness. It is
plausible to see here the origin of Kant&rsquo;s categorical
imperative. But he also added a third motivation, what he called
&lsquo;the drive of conscience&rsquo; which is &lsquo;the natural
drive to recognize a divine moral law&rsquo; (&ldquo;A Guide to
Rational Living,&rdquo; <em>Moral Philosophy from Montaigne to
Kant</em>, &sect;132, 574). His idea was that we have within us this
separate capacity to recognize divine command and to be drawn towards
it out of a sense of dependence on the God who prescribes the command
to us, and will punish us if we disobey (though our motive should not
be to avoid punishment) (Ibid., &sect;135).</p>

<p>
The history of empiricism in Britain from Hobbes to Hume is also the
history of the attempt to re-establish human knowledge, not from above
(from indubitable principles of reason) but from below (from
experience and especially the experience of the senses). Thomas Hobbes
(1588&ndash;1649) said that all reality is bodily (including God), and
all events are motions in space. Willing, too, is a motion, and is
merely the last act of desire or aversion in any process of
deliberation. His view is that it is natural, and so reasonable, for
each of us to aim solely at our own preservation or pleasure. In the
state of nature, humans are selfish, and their lives are
&lsquo;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short&rsquo;, a war of all
against all (<em>Leviathan</em>, Ch. 13). The first precept of the law
of nature is then for each of us, pursuing our own interest, &lsquo;to
endeavor peace, as far as he has hope of attaining it; and when he
cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages
of war&rsquo; (<em>Ibid</em>., Ch. 14). The second precept is that
each of us should be willing to lay down our natural rights to
everything to the extent that others are also willing. Hobbes
concludes with the need to subordinate ourselves to a sovereign who
alone will be able to secure peace. The second and longest portion of
<em>Leviathan</em> is devoted to religion, where Hobbes argues that
Scripture authorizes the earthly sovereign to be the sole interpreter
of Scripture, a move he hoped would end civil wars of religion
(<em>Ibid</em>., Ch. 33).</p>

<p>
John Locke (1632&ndash;1704) followed Hobbes in deriving morality from
our need to live together in peace given our natural discord, but he
denied that we are mechanically moved by our desires. He agreed with
Hobbes in saying that moral laws are God&rsquo;s imposition, but
disagreed by making God&rsquo;s power and <em>benevolence</em> both
necessary conditions for God&rsquo;s authority in this respect
(<em>Treatises</em>, IV. XIII. 3). He also held that our reason can
work out counsels or advice about moral matters; but only God&rsquo;s
imposition makes <em>law</em> (and hence obligation), and we only know
about God&rsquo;s imposition from revelation (<em>The Reasonableness
of Christianity</em>, 62&ndash;5). He therefore devoted considerable
attention to justifying belief in the reliability of revelation.</p>

<p>
The deists (e.g., William Wollaston, 1659&ndash;1724) believed that
humans can reason from their experience of nature to the existence and
some of the attributes of God, that special revelation is accordingly
unnecessary, that God does not intervene in human affairs (after
creation) and that the good life for humans finds adequate guidance in
philosophical ethics. Frances Hutcheson (1694&ndash;1746) was not a
deist, but does think that human beings are naturally endowed with
everything needed to live well. He distinguished between objects that
are naturally good, which excite personal or selfish pleasure, and
those that are morally good, which are advantageous to <em>all</em>
persons affected. He took himself to be giving a reading of moral
goodness as <em>agape</em>, the Greek word for the love of neighbor
that Jesus prescribes. This love is benevolence, Hutcheson said, and
it is formulated in the principle &lsquo;That Action is best, which
procures the greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers&rsquo;
(<em>Inquiry</em> II, III, VIII). Because these definitions of natural
and moral good produce a possible gap between the two, we need some
way to believe that morality and happiness are coincident. Hutcheson
thought that God has given us a moral sense for this purpose
(<em>Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions</em>, II). This
moral sense responds to instances of benevolence with approbation and
a unique kind of pleasure. Like Scotus&rsquo;s affection for justice,
it is not confined to our perception of advantage. The result of our
having moral sense is that when intending the good of others, we
&lsquo;undesignedly&rsquo; end up promoting our own greatest good as
well because we end up gratifying ourselves along with others. God
shows benevolence by first making <em>us</em> benevolent and then
giving us this moral sense that gets joy from the approbation of our
benevolence. To contemporary British opponents of moral sense theory,
this seemed too rosy or benign a picture; our joy in approving
benevolence is not enough to make morality and happiness coincident.
We need also obligation and divine sanction. Both moral sense
theorists and their opponents departed substantially from the ecstatic
form of eudaimonism characteristic of Aquinas and many other earlier
Christian thinkers. Instead of thinking of happiness as something that
flows from the perfected love of God for God&rsquo;s own sake, they
understood happiness in terms of personal gratification.</p>

<p>
Bishop Joseph Butler (1692&ndash;1752) held that God&rsquo;s goodness
consists in benevolence, in wanting us to be happy, and that we should
want the same for each other. He made the important point, against the
Hobbesian doctrine of universal selfishness, that something can be
good for an agent because it is what he wants without this meaning
that the <em>content</em> of what he wants has anything to do with
himself (<em>Fifteen Sermons</em>, 126&ndash;27).</p>

<p>
David Hume (1711&ndash;76) is the first figure in this narrative who
can properly be attached to the Enlightenment, though this term means
very different things in Scotland, in France and in Germany. Hume held
that reason cannot command or move the human will. Since morals
clearly do have an influence on actions and affections, they are
derived not from reason but from the sentiments (Treatise III.1). For
Hume an action, or sentiment, or character, is virtuous or vicious
&lsquo;because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a
particular kind&rsquo; (<em>Ibid</em>., III.2). Since the idea of
morality implies something universal, there must be some sentiment of
sympathy or (he later says) humanity, which is common to all human
beings, and which &lsquo;recommends the same object to general
approbation&rsquo; (<em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of
Morals</em>, IX. I. 221). Hume thought we could get conventional moral
conclusions from these moral sentiments, which nature has fortunately
given us. He was also skeptical about any attempt to derive
conclusions containing &lsquo;ought&rsquo; from premises containing
only &lsquo;is&rsquo;, though scholars debate the scope of the
premises he is talking about here; probably he included premises about
God&rsquo;s will or nature or action. Hume was a religious skeptic,
highly critical of the social and political damage resulting from
religious &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; and &ldquo;enthusiasm.&rdquo; He
thus sought to show that the moral sentiments could operate
independently of religious belief (Herdt, <em>Religion and
Faction</em>).</p>

<p>
The Enlightenment in France had a more anti-clerical flavor (in part
because of the history of Jansenism, unique to France), and for the
first time in this narrative we meet genuine atheists, such as Baron
d&rsquo;Holbach (1723&ndash;89) who held not only that morality did
not need religion, but that religion, and especially Christianity, was
its major impediment. Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Voltaire (1694-1778) was,
especially towards the end of his life, opposed to Christianity, but
not to religion in general (<em>Letters of Voltaire and Frederick the
Great</em>, letter 156). He accepted from the English deists the idea
that what is true in Christian teachings is the core of human values
that are universally true in all religions, and (like the German
rationalists) he admired Confucius. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78)
said, famously, that mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in
chains (<em>The Social Contract</em>, Ch. 1). This supposes a
disjunction between nature and contemporary society; now we need some
kind of social contract to protect us from the corrupting effects of
society upon the proper love of self. Nature is understood as the
whole realm of being created by God, who guarantees its goodness,
unity, and order. Rousseau held that we do not need any intermediary
between us and God, and we can attain salvation by returning to nature
in this high sense and by developing all our faculties harmoniously.
Our ultimate happiness is to feel ourselves at one with the system
that God created.</p>

<p>
Immanuel Kant (1724&ndash;1804) is the most important figure of the
Enlightenment in Germany. His project is different in many ways from
those of his French contemporaries. He was brought up in a pietist
Lutheran family, and his system retains many features from, for
example, Crusius. But he was also indebted through Wolff to Leibniz.
Moreover, he was &lsquo;awoken from his dogmatic slumbers&rsquo; by
reading Hume, though Kant is referring here to Hume&rsquo;s attack on
causation, not his ethical theory (<em>Prolegomena</em>, 4:260).
Kant&rsquo;s mature project was to limit human knowledge &lsquo;in
order to make room for faith&rsquo; (<em>KrV</em>, B xxx). He accepted
from Hume that our knowledge is confined within the limits of possible
sense experience, but he did not accept skeptical conclusions about
causation or the soul. Reason is not confined, in his view, to the
same limits as knowledge, and we are rationally required to hold
beliefs about things as they are in themselves, not merely things as
they appear to us. In particular, we are required to believe in God,
freedom and immortality. These are three &lsquo;postulates of
practical reason&rsquo;, required to make rational sense of the fact
of moral obligation, the fact that we are under the moral law (the
&lsquo;categorical imperative&rsquo;) that requires us to will the
maxim of an action (the prescription of the action together with the
reason for it) as a universal law (removing any self-preference) and
to treat humanity in any person as always at the same time an end and
never merely as a means (<em>Groundwork</em>, 4.421, 429). Kant
thought that humans have to be able to believe that morality in this
demanding form is consistent in the long run with happiness (both
their own and that of the people they affect by their actions), if
they are going to be able to persevere in the moral life without
rational instability. He did not accept the three traditional
<em>theoretical</em> arguments for the existence of God (though he was
sympathetic to a modest version of the teleological argument). But
this <em>practical</em> argument was decisive for him, though he held
that it was possible to be morally good without being a theist,
despite such a position being rationally unstable.</p>

<p>
In <em>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</em> he undertook
the project of using moral language in order to translate the four
main themes of Biblical revelation (accessible only to particular
people at particular times) into the revelation to Reason (accessible
to all people at all times). This does not mean that he intended to
reduce Biblical faith to morality, though some scholars have taken him
this way. The translated versions of Creation, Fall, Redemption and
Second Coming are as follows (see Hare 1996): Humans have an initial
predisposition to the good, which is essential to them, but is
overlaid with a propensity to evil, which is not essential to them.
Since they are born under &lsquo;the Evil Maxim&rsquo; that
subordinates duty to happiness, they are unable by their own devices
to reverse this ranking, and require &lsquo;an effect of grace&rsquo;
(<em>Religion</em>, 6.53). Providence ushers in progress (though not
continuous) towards an &lsquo;ethical commonwealth&rsquo; in which we
together make the moral law our own law, by appropriating it as
authoritative for our own lives (this is what Kant means by
&lsquo;autonomy&rsquo;) (<em>Religion</em>, 6.98&ndash;99;
<em>Groundwork</em>, 4.433&ndash;34).</p>

<p>
A whole succession of Kant&rsquo;s followers tried to &lsquo;go
beyond&rsquo; Kant by showing that there was finally no need to make
the separation between our knowledge and the thing-in-itself beyond
our knowledge. One key step was taken by Johann Gottlieb Fichte
(1762&ndash;1814), who identified (as Kant did not) the will of the
individual with the infinite Ego which is ordering the universe
morally. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770&ndash;1831) accomplished
a somewhat similar end by proposing that we should make the truth of
ideas relative to their original historical context against the
background of a history that is progressing towards a final stage of
&lsquo;absolute knowledge&rsquo;, in which Spirit (in German
<em>Geist</em>, which means also &lsquo;mind&rsquo;) understands that
reality is its own creation and there is no &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; for
it to know. Hegel is giving a philosophical account of the Biblical
and Neo-Platonic notion of all things returning to God, &lsquo;so that
God may be all in all&rsquo; (<em>I Cor</em>. 15:28). He thought that
Geist moves immanently through human history, and that the various
stages of knowledge are also stages of freedom, each stage producing
first its own internal contradiction, and then a radical transition
into a new stage. The stage of absolute freedom will be one in which
all members freely by reason endorse the organic community and the
concrete institutions in which they actually live
(<em>Phenomenology</em>, BB, VI, B, III).</p>

<p>
One of Hegel&rsquo;s opponents was Arthur Schopenhauer
(1799&ndash;1860), the philosopher of pessimism. Schopenhauer thought
that Hegel had strayed from the Kantian truth that there is a
thing-in-itself beyond appearance, and that the Will is such a thing.
He differed from Kant, however, in seeing the Will as the source of
all our endless suffering, a blind striving power without ultimate
purpose or design (<em>The World as Will and Representation</em>,
&sect;56 p. 310 and &sect;57 p. 311). It is, moreover, one universal
Will that underlies the wills of all separate individuals. The
intellect and its ideas are simply the Will&rsquo;s servant. On this
view, there is no happiness for us, and our only consolation is a
(quasi-Buddhist) release from the Will to the limited extent we can
attain it, especially through aesthetic enjoyment.</p>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s followers split into what are sometimes called
&lsquo;Right Hegelians&rsquo; and &lsquo;Left Hegelians&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;Young Hegelians&rsquo;). Right Hegelians promoted the generally
positive view of the Prussian state that Hegel expressed in the
<em>Philosophy of Right</em>. Left Hegelians rejected it, and with it
the Protestant Christianity which they saw as its vehicle. In this way
Hegel&rsquo;s peculiar way of promoting Christianity ended up causing
its vehement rejection by thinkers who shared many of his social
ideals. David Friedrich Strauss (1808&ndash;74) wrote <em>The Life of
Jesus Critically Examined</em>, launching the historical-critical
method of Biblical scholarship with the suggestion that much of the
Biblical account is myth or &lsquo;unconscious invention&rsquo;.
Ludwig Feuerbach (1804&ndash;72) argued in <em>The Essence of
Christianity</em> that religion resulted from humanity&rsquo;s
alienation from itself. Philosophy needed to destroy the religious
illusion so that we could learn to love humankind and not divert this
love onto an imaginary object. Karl Marx (1818&ndash;83) followed
Feuerbach in this diagnosis of religion, but he was interested
primarily in social and political relations rather than psychology. He
saw theory (for example Hegel&rsquo;s) as itself a symptom of the
power structures in the societies that produce it.
&lsquo;Ideologies&rsquo; and &lsquo;religion,&rsquo; he believed,
arise from &ldquo;conditions that require [these] illusions&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Critique of Hegel&rsquo;s Philosophy of Right,&rdquo;
<em>Early Writings</em>, 244). Marx returned to Hegel&rsquo;s thoughts
about work revealing to the worker his value through what the worker
produces, but Marx argues that under capitalism the worker was
alienated from this product because other people owned both the
product and the means of producing it. Marx urged that the only way to
prevent this was to destroy the institution of private property
(&ldquo;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts,&rdquo; <em>Early
Writings</em>, 348). Thus he believed, like Hegel, in progress through
history towards freedom, but he thought it would take Communist
revolution to bring this about.</p>

<p>
A very different response to Hegel (and Kant) is found in the work of
S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard (1813&ndash;55), a religious thinker who
started, like Hegel and Kant, from Lutheranism. Kierkegaard mocked
Hegel for presuming to understand the whole system in which human
history is embedded, while still being located in a particular small
part of it. On the other hand, he used Hegelian categories of thought
himself, especially in his dialectical understanding of the aesthetic
life, the ethical life and the religious life as stages through which
human beings develop by means of first internal contradiction and then
radical transition. In <em>Either/Or</em> he also caricatured
Kant&rsquo;s ethical thought (as well as Hegel&rsquo;s) in the person
of Judge William, who is stuck within the ethical life and has not
been able to reach the life of faith. On the other hand, his own
description of the religious life is full of echoes of Kant&rsquo;s
<em>Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</em>. Kierkegaard
wrote most of his work pseudonymously, taking on the names of
characters who lived the lives he describes. In the aesthetic life the
goal is to keep boredom at bay, and this requires flitting from
engagement to engagement without commitment (<em>Either/Or</em>, II.
77). This life deconstructs, because it requires (in order to sustain
interest) the very commitment that it also rejects. The transition is
accomplished by making a choice for one&rsquo;s life as a whole from a
position that is not attached to any particular project, a radical
choice that requires admitting the aesthetic life has been a failure.
In this choice one discovers freedom, and thus the ethical life
(<em>Either/Or</em>, II. 188). But this life too deconstructs, because
it sets up the goal of living by a demand, the moral law, that is
higher than we can live by our own human devices. Kierkegaard thought
we have to realize that God is (contrary to Fichte)
&lsquo;another&rsquo; (<em>Sickness unto Death</em> xi 128), with whom
we have to relate, and whose assistance is necessary even for the kind
of repentance that is the transition into the religious life. He also
suggested that within the religious life, there is a
&lsquo;repetition&rsquo; of the aesthetic life and the ethical life,
though in a transformed version.</p>

<p>
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844&ndash;1900) was the son of a Lutheran pastor
in Prussia. Nietzsche was deeply influenced by Schopenhauer,
especially his view of the will (which Nietzsche called &lsquo;the
Will to Power&rsquo;). Nietzsche saw clearly the intimate link between
Christianity and the ethical theories of his predecessors in Europe.
In <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em>, he says, &lsquo;The advent of
the Christian God, as the maximum god attained so far, was therefore
accompanied by the maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness on earth.
Presuming we have gradually entered upon the <em>reverse</em> course,
there is no small probability that with the irresistible decline of
faith in the Christian God, there is now also a considerable decline
in mankind&rsquo;s feeling of guilt&rsquo; (<em>On the Genealogy of
Morals</em>, 90&ndash;1). This is the &lsquo;death of God&rsquo; which
Nietzsche announced, and which he predicted would also be the end of
Kantian ethics (<em>The Gay Science</em>, &sect;108, 125, 343).
Nietzsche admired the Ancient Greeks, and thought we would be better
off with a &lsquo;master&rsquo; morality like theirs, rather than a
&lsquo;slave&rsquo; morality like Christianity. &lsquo;Mastery over
himself also necessarily gives him mastery over circumstances, over
nature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures&rsquo;
(<em>Genealogy</em>, 59&ndash;60). The model of this mastery is the
&lsquo;overman&rsquo; who is free of the resentment by the weak of the
strong that Nietzsche thought lay at the basis of Christian
ethics.</p>

<p>
To return to Britain, Hume had a number of successors who accepted the
view (which Hume took from Hutcheson) that our fundamental obligation
is to work for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Four are
especially significant. William Paley (1743&ndash;1805) thought he
could demonstrate that morality derived from the will of God and
required promoting the happiness of all, that happiness was the sum of
pleasures, and that we need to believe that God is the final granter
of happiness if we are to sustain motivation to do what we know we
ought to do (<em>The Principles of Moral and Political
Philosophy</em>, II. 4). Jeremy Bentham (1748&ndash;1832) rejected
this theological context. His grounds were radically empiricist. The
only &lsquo;real&rsquo; entities are publicly observable, and so do
not include God (or, for that matter, right or time or relations or
qualities). He thought he could provide a scientific calculus of
pleasures, where the unit that stays constant is the minimum state of
sensibility that can be distinguished from indifference. He thought we
could then separate different &lsquo;dimensions&rsquo; in which these
units vary, such as intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity (how
soon the pleasures will come), fecundity (how many other pleasures
this pleasure will produce) and purity. Discarding the theological
context made moral motivation problematic, for why should we expect
(without God to arrange things this way) more units of pleasure for
ourselves by contributing to the greater pleasure of others?
Bentham&rsquo;s solution was to hope that law and social custom could
provide individuals with adequate motives through the threat of social
sanctions, and that what he called &lsquo;deontology&rsquo; (which is
personal or private morality) could mobilize hidden or long-range
interests that were already present but obscure.</p>

<p>
John Stuart Mill (1806&ndash;73) was raised on strict utilitarian
principles by his father, a follower of Bentham. Unlike Bentham,
however, Mill accepted that there are qualitative differences among
pleasures. He thought that the higher pleasures were those of the
intellect, the feelings and imagination, and the moral sentiments. He
observed that those who have experienced both these and the lower
pleasures, tend to prefer the former. At the age of twenty he had a
collapse and a prolonged period of &lsquo;melancholy&rsquo;. He
realized that his education had neglected the culture or cultivation
of <em>feelings</em>, of which hope is a primary instance
(<em>Autobiography</em>, 1. 84). In his <em>Three Essays on
Religion</em> (published posthumously in 1874) he returned to the idea
of hope, saying that &lsquo;the indulgence of hope with regard to the
government of the universe and the destiny of man after death, while
we recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more than a
hope, is legitimate and philosophically defensible&rsquo;; without
such hope, we are kept down by &lsquo;the disastrous feeling of
&ldquo;not worth while&rdquo;&rsquo; (<em>Three Essays</em>
249&ndash;50). Mill did not believe, however, that God was omnipotent,
given all the evil in the world, and he insisted, like Kant, that we
have to be God&rsquo;s co-workers, not merely passive recipients of
God&rsquo;s assistance.</p>

<p>
Henry Sidgwick (1838&ndash;1900) in <em>Methods of Ethics</em>
distinguished three methods: Intuitionism (roughly, the common sense
morality that some things, like deliberate ingratitude to a
benefactor, are self-evidently wrong in themselves independently of
their consequences), Egoistic Hedonism (the view that self-evidently
an individual ought to aim at a maximum balance of happiness for
herself, where this is understood as the greatest balance of pleasure
over pain), and Utilitarianism or Universalistic Hedonism, (the view
that self-evidently she ought to aim at the maximum balance of
happiness for all sentient beings present and future, whatever the
cost to herself). Of these three, he rejected the first, on the
grounds that no concrete ethical principles are self-evident, and that
when they conflict (as they do) we have to take consequences into
account in order to decide how to act. But Sidgwick found the relation
between the other two methods much more problematic. Each principle
separately seemed to him self-evident, but when taken together they
seemed to be mutually inconsistent. He considered two solutions,
psychological and metaphysical. The psychological solution was to
bring in the pleasures and pains of sympathy, so that if we do good to
all we end up (because of these pleasures) making ourselves happiest.
Sidgwick rejected this on the basis that sympathy is inevitably
limited in its range, and we feel it most towards those closest to us,
so that even if we include sympathetic pleasures and pains under
Egoism, it will tend to increase the divergence between Egoistic and
Utilitarian conduct, rather than bring them closer together. The
metaphysical solution was to bring in a god who desires the greatest
total good of all living things, and who will reward and punish in
accordance with this desire. Sidgwick recognized this as a return to
the utilitarianism of Paley (Compare <em>Methods of Ethics</em>, II.
1, 2 and IV. 4, 5). He thought this solution was both necessary and
sufficient to remove the contradiction in ethics. But this was only a
reason to accept it, if in general it is reasonable to accept certain
principles (such as the Uniformity of Nature) which are not
self-evident and which cannot be proved, but which bring order and
coherence into a central part of our thought. Sidgwick did not commit
himself to an answer to this, one way or the other.</p>

<h2 id="ContPhil">5. Contemporary Philosophy</h2>

<p>
In the twentieth century professional philosophy in the West diverged
into &lsquo;Analytic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Continental&rsquo; streams.
Towards the end of the century, however, more philosophers could speak
the languages of both traditions. The beginning of the analytic school
is sometimes located with the rejection of neo-Hegelian idealism by
G.E. Moore (1873&ndash;1958). One way to characterize the two schools
is that the Continental school continued to read and be influenced by
Hegel, and the Analytic school (with some exceptions) did not. Another
way to make the distinction is geographical; the analytic school is
located primarily in Britain, Scandinavia and North America, and the
continental school in the rest of Europe, in Latin America and in
certain schools in North America.</p>

<p>
We will start with some figures from the Continental school, and then
move to the analytic. Martin Heidegger (1889&ndash;1976) was initially
trained as a theologian, and wrote his dissertation on what he took to
be a work of Duns Scotus. He took an appointment under Edmund Husserl
(1855&ndash;1938) at Freiburg, and was then appointed to succeed him
in his chair. Husserl&rsquo;s program of &lsquo;phenomenology&rsquo;
was to recover a sense of certainty about the world by studying in
exhaustive detail the cognitive structure of appearance. Heidegger
departed from Husserl in approaching Being through a focus on
&lsquo;Human Being&rsquo; (in German <em>Dasein</em>) concerned above
all for its fate in an alien world, or as &lsquo;anxiety&rsquo;
(<em>Angst</em>) towards death (see <em>Being and Time</em> I. 6). In
this sense he is the first existentialist, though he did not use the
term. Heidegger emphasized that we are &lsquo;thrown&rsquo; into a
world that is not &lsquo;home&rsquo;, and we have a radical choice
about what possibilities for ourselves we will make actual. Heidegger
drew here from Kierkegaard, with whom he also shared a horror at mere
conventionality, what Heidegger calls &lsquo;the They&rsquo; (<em>das
Man</em>). He is unlike Kierkegaard, however, in thinking of
traditional Christianity as just one more convention making authentic
existence more difficult. In Heidegger, as in Nietzsche and
Schopenhauer, it is hard to find a positive or constructive ethics.
Heidegger&rsquo;s position is somewhat compromised, moreover, by his
initial embrace of the Nazi party. In his later work he moved
increasingly towards a kind of quasi-religious mysticism. His Romantic
hatred of the modern world and his distrust of system-building led to
the espousal of either silence or poetry as the best way to be open to
the &lsquo;something&rsquo; (sometimes he says &lsquo;the
earth&rsquo;) which reveals itself only as
&lsquo;self-secluding&rsquo; or hiding itself away from our various
conceptualizations. He held the hope that through poetry, and in
particular the poetry of H&ouml;lderlin, we might be able to still
sense something of the unknown god who appears &lsquo;as the one who
remains unknown,&rsquo; who is quite different from the object of
theology or piety, but who can bring us back to the Being we have long
lost sight of (<em>Poetry, Language, Thought</em>, 222).</p>

<p>
Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-80) did use the label
&lsquo;existentialist&rsquo;, and said that &lsquo;Existentialism is
nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a
coherent atheist position&rsquo; (<em>Existentialism and Human
Emotions</em>, 51). He denied (like Scotus) that the moral law could
be deduced from human nature, but this was because (unlike Scotus) he
thought that we give ourselves our own essences by the choices we
make. His slogan was, &lsquo;Existence precedes essence&rsquo; (Ibid.,
13). &lsquo;Essence&rsquo; is here the defining property of a thing,
and Sartre gave the example of a paper cutter, which is given its
definition by the artisan who makes it. Sartre said that when people
believed God made human beings, they could believe humans had a
God-given essence; but now that we do not believe this, we have
realized that humans give themselves their own essences (&lsquo;First
of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only
afterwards, defines himself.&rsquo; Ibid., 15). Sartre thought of
human beings as forced to take on a godlike role&nbsp;even though
there is no God. This is an inevitably fruitless undertaking, which he
called &lsquo;anguish&rsquo;, as we are confronted with the task of
choosing not just for ourselves, but on behalf of everyone.&nbsp;To
recognize that this project does not make sense is required by
honesty, and to hide this from ourselves is &lsquo;bad faith&rsquo;.
One form of bad faith is to pretend that there is a God who is giving
us our tasks. Another is to pretend that there is a &lsquo;human
nature&rsquo; that is doing the same thing. To live authentically is
to realize both that we create these tasks for ourselves, and that
they are futile.</p>

<p>
The twentieth century also saw, within Roman Catholicism, forms of
Christian Existentialism and new adaptations of the system of Thomas
Aquinas. Gabriel Marcel (1889&ndash;1973), like Heidegger, was
concerned with the nature of Being as it appears to human being, but
he tried to show that there are experiences of love, joy, hope and
faith which, as understood from <em>within</em>, give us reason to
believe in an inexhaustible Presence, which is God. Jacques Maritain
(1882&ndash;1973) developed a form of Thomism that retained the
natural law, but regarded ethical judgment as not purely cognitive but
guided by pre-conceptual affective inclinations. He gave more place to
history than did traditional Thomism, allowing for development in the
human knowledge of natural law, and he defended democracy as the
appropriate way for human persons to attain freedom and dignity. The
notion of the value of the person and the capacities given to persons
by their creator was at the center of the &lsquo;personalism&rsquo; of
Pope John Paul II&rsquo;s <em>The Acting Person</em> (1979),
influenced by Max Scheler (1874&ndash;1928).</p>

<p>
Michel Foucault (1926&ndash;84) followed Nietzsche in aspiring to
uncover the &lsquo;genealogy&rsquo; of various contemporary forms of
thought and practice (he was concerned, for example, with our
treatment of sexuality and mental illness), and how relations of power
and domination have produced &lsquo;discourses of truth&rsquo;
(&ldquo;Truth and Power,&rdquo; <em>Power</em>, 131). Foucault
analyzed disciplinary power as a productive force that need not
oppress because it reconstructs individuals&rsquo; thoughts and
desires. The self was seen as purely constructed, thrown up by the
ceaseless play of social forces, practices, and institutions. Foucault
offered no anthropology, no account of human nature and no account of
what it is to flourish as a member of the human kind. The dissolution
of the self meant the loss of any stable ground from which social
authorities, practices, and institutions could be evaluated and
critiqued. Foucault sought towards the end of his life to articulate a
more positive conception of virtue, one inspired by ancient
philosophical practices of care of the self. In contrast with legal
conceptions of morality as conformity to rules or code, virtue
suggested to Foucault a process in which agential capacity is
continually enhanced. He conceived of care of the self, similarly, as
a space of self-creation. It is not a matter of assimilation to a
pre-given norm but is radically pluralistic, an aesthetic of existence
within which one chooses one&rsquo;s own ascetic disciplines, modes of
observation and training and measurement, in service of curating a
personal style.</p>

<p>
J&uuml;rgen Habermas (1929-) proposed a &lsquo;communicative
ethics&rsquo; that develops the Kantian element in Marxism (<em>The
Theory of Communicative Action</em>, Vols. I and II). By analyzing the
structure of communication (using speech-act theory developed in
analytic philosophy) he lays out a procedure for the rational
justification of norms. The two ideas behind this procedure are that
norms are valid if they receive the consent of all the affected
parties in unconstrained practical communication, and if the
consequences of the general observance of the norms (in terms of how
each person&rsquo;s interests are affected) are acceptable to all.
Habermas thinks he fulfills in this way Hegel&rsquo;s aim of
reconciling the individual and society, because the communication
process extends individuals beyond their private perspectives in the
process of reaching agreement. Religious convictions need to be left
behind when entering the public square, on this scheme, because they
are not communicable in the way the procedure requires. In recent work
he has modified this position, by recognizing that certain religious
forms require their adherents to speak in an explicitly religious way
when advancing their prescriptions for public life, and it is
discriminatory to try to prevent their doing so.</p>

<p>
Within contemporary Jewish ethics mention should be made of Martin
Buber (1878&ndash;1965) and Emmanuel Levinas (1906&ndash;95).
Buber&rsquo;s form of existentialism emphasized the I-You
relationship, which exists not only between human beings but (out of
that) between human beings and God. When we reject I-You relationship,
we return to I-It relations, governed by our impositions of our own
conceptualizations on objects. Buber said these two relations are
exhaustive. &lsquo;There is no I as such but only the I of the basic
word I-You and the I of the basic word I-It.&rsquo; (<em>I and
Thou</em>, 54). Levinas studied under Husserl, and knew Heidegger,
whose work he first embraced and then rejected. His focus, like
Buber&rsquo;s, was on the &lsquo;ethics of the Other&rsquo;, and he
held that the face of the Other makes a demand on us even before we
recognize our freedom to accept it or reject it. To meet the Other is
to have the idea of Infinity (<em>Ethics and Infinity</em>,
90&ndash;1).</p>

<p>
The origin of analytic philosophy can be associated with G.E. Moore.
His <em>Principia Ethica</em> (1903) can be regarded as the first
major ethical document of the school. He was strongly influenced by
Sidgwick at Cambridge, but rejected Sidgwick&rsquo;s negative views
about intuitionism. He thought that intrinsic goodness was a real
property of things, even though (like the number two) it does not
exist in time and is not the object of sense experience. He explicitly
aligned himself here with Plato and against the class of empiricist
philosophers, &lsquo;to which most Englishmen have belonged&rsquo;
(<em>Principia Ethica</em>, 162). His predecessors, Moore thought, had
almost all committed the error, which he called &lsquo;the
naturalistic fallacy,&rsquo; of trying to define this value property
by identifying it with a non-evaluative property. For example, they
proposed that goodness is pleasure, or what produces pleasure. But
whatever non-evaluative property we try to say goodness is identical
to, we will find that it remains an open question whether that
property is in fact good. For example, it makes sense to ask whether
pleasure or the production of pleasure is good. This is true also if
we propose a supernatural property to identify with goodness, for
example the property of being commanded by God. It still makes sense
to ask whether what God commands is good. This question cannot be the
same as the question &lsquo;Is what God commands what God
commands?&rsquo; which is not still an open question. Moore thought
that if these questions are different, then the two properties,
goodness and being commanded by God, cannot be the same, and to say
(by way of a definition) that they are the same is to commit the
fallacy. Intrinsic goodness, Moore said, is a simple non-natural
property (i.e., neither natural nor supernatural) and indefinable. He
thought we had a special form of cognition that he called
&lsquo;intuition,&rsquo; which gives us access to such properties. By
this he meant that the access was not based on inference or argument,
but was self-evident (though we could still get it wrong, just as we
can with sense-perception). He thought the way to determine what
things had positive value intrinsically was to consider what things
were such that, if they existed <em>by themselves</em> in isolation,
we would yet judge their existence to be good.</p>

<p>
At Cambridge Moore was a colleague of Ludwig Wittgenstein
(1889&ndash;1951). Wittgenstein&rsquo;s views on ethics are enigmatic
and subject to wildly different interpretations. In the
<em>Tractatus</em> (which concerns the relationship between thoughts,
as logical pictures of facts, and the world, as states of
affairs),&nbsp;he says at the end, &lsquo;It is clear that ethics
cannot be put into words. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and
aesthetics are one and the same.)&rsquo; (<em>Tractatus</em>, 6.421).
Perhaps he means that the world we occupy is good or bad (and happy or
unhappy) as a whole, and not piece-by-piece. Wittgenstein (like
Nietzsche) was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer&rsquo;s notion of
will, and by his disdain for ethical theories that purport to be able
to tell one what to do and what not to do. The <em>Tractatus</em> was
taken up by the Logical Positivists, who held a
&lsquo;verificationist&rsquo; theory of meaning, such that assertions
can be meaningful only if they can in principle be verified by sense
experience or if they are tautologies (for example, &lsquo;All
bachelors are unmarried men.&rsquo;) This seems to leave ethical
statements (and statements about God) meaningless, and indeed that was
the deliberately provocative position taken by A.J. Ayer
(1910&ndash;89). Ayer accepted Moore&rsquo;s arguments about the
naturalistic fallacy, and since Moore&rsquo;s talk of
&lsquo;non-natural properties&rsquo; seemed to Ayer just nonsense, he
was led to emphasize and analyze further the non-cognitive ingredient
in evaluation which Moore had identified. Suppose I say to a cannibal,
&lsquo;You acted wrongly in eating your prisoner.&rsquo; Ayer thought
I am not <em>stating</em> anything more than if I had simply said,
&lsquo;You ate your prisoner.&rsquo; I am, rather, evincing my moral
disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, &lsquo;You ate your
prisoner&rsquo; in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the
addition of some special exclamation marks (<em>Language, Truth and
Logic</em>, 107&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
This emotivist theory of ethics had its most articulate treatment in
<em>Ethics and Language</em> by Charles Stevenson (1908&ndash;79).
Stevenson was a positivist, but also the heir of John Dewey
(1859&ndash;1952) and the American pragmatist tradition. Dewey had
rejected the idea of fixed ends for human beings, and stressed that
moral deliberation occurs in the context of competition within a
person between different ends, none of which can be assumed permanent.
He criticized theories that tried to derive moral principles from
self-certifying reason, or intuition, or cosmic forms, or divine
commands, both because he thought there are no self-certifying
faculties or self-evident norms, and because the alleged derivation
disguises the actual function of the principles as devices for social
action. Stevenson applied this emphasis to the competition between
<em>people</em> with different ends, and stressed the role of moral
language as a social instrument for persuasion (<em>Ethics and
Language</em>, Ch. 5). On his account, normative judgments express
attitudes and invite others to share these attitudes, but they are not
strictly speaking true or false.</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein did not publish any book after the <em>Tractatus</em>,
but he wrote and taught; and after his death <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em> was published in 1953. The later thought of
Wittgenstein bears a similar relation to the <em>Tractatus</em> as
Heidegger bears to Husserl. In both cases the quest for a kind of
scientific certainty was replaced by the recognition that science is
itself just one language, and not in many cases prior by right. The
later Wittgenstein employed the notion of different &lsquo;forms of
life&rsquo; in which different &lsquo;language games&rsquo; including
those of religion are at home (<em>Philosophical Investigation</em>,
&sect;7, 19, 373). In Oxford there was a parallel though distinct
development centering round the work of John Austin (1911&ndash;60).
Austin did not suppose that ordinary language was infallible, but he
did think that it preserved a great deal of wisdom that had passed the
test of centuries of experience, and that traditional philosophical
discussion had ignored this primary material. In <em>How to do Things
with Words</em> (published posthumously) Austin labeled &lsquo;the
descriptive fallacy&rsquo; the mistake of thinking that all language
is used to perform the act of describing or reporting (<em>How to do
Things with Words</em>, 3).</p>

<p>
R.M. Hare (1919&ndash;2002) took up the diagnosis of this fallacy, and
proposed a &lsquo;universal prescriptivism&rsquo; which attributed
three characteristics to the language of morality. First, it is
prescriptive, which is to say that moral judgments express the will in
a way analogous to commands. This preserves the emotivist insight that
moral judgment is different from assertion, but does not deny the role
of rationality in such judgment. Second, moral judgment is
universalizable. This is similar to the formula of Kant&rsquo;s
categorical imperative that requires that we be able to will the
maxims of our actions as universal laws. Third, moral judgment is
overriding. This means that moral prescriptions legitimately take
precedence over any other normative prescriptions. In <em>Moral
Thinking</em> (1981) Hare claimed to demonstrate that utilitarianism
followed from these three features of morality, though he excluded
ideals (in the sense of preferences for how the world should be
independently of the agent&rsquo;s concurrent desires or experience)
from the scope of this argument. God enters in two ways into this
picture. First, Hare proposed a figure he calls &lsquo;the
archangel&rsquo; who is the model for fully critical (as opposed to
intuitive) moral thinking, having full access to all the relevant
information and complete impartiality between the affected parties.
Hare acknowledge that since archangels (e.g., Lucifer) are not
reliably impartial in this way, it is really God who is the model.
Second, we have to be able to believe (as Kant argued) that the
universe sustains morality in the sense that it is worthwhile trying
to be morally good. Hare thought that this requires something like a
belief (he called it a &lsquo;blik&rsquo;) in the operation of
Providence (&ldquo;The Simple Believer,&rdquo; <em>Essays on Religion
and Education</em>, appendix, 37&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
One of the most prominent opponents of utilitarianism in the twentieth
century was John Rawls (1921&ndash;2005). In his <em>Theory of
Justice</em> (1971) he gave, like Hare, an account of ethics heavily
indebted to Kant. But he insisted that utilitarianism does not capture
the Kantian insight that each person is an end in himself or herself,
because it &lsquo;does not take seriously the distinction between
persons&rsquo; (<em>Theory of Justice</em>, 22). He constructed the
thought experiment of the &lsquo;Original Position&rsquo; in which
individuals imagine themselves not knowing what role in society they
are going to play or what endowments of talent or material wealth they
possess, and agree together on what principles of justice they will
accept. Rawls thought it important that substantive conceptions of the
good life were left behind in moving to the Original Position, because
he was attempting to provide an account of justice that people with
competing visions of the good could agree to in a pluralist society.
Like the early Habermas, he included religions under this prohibition.
In <em>Political Liberalism</em> (1993), he conceded that the
procedure of the Original Position is itself ideologically
constrained, and he moved to the idea of an overlapping consensus:
Kantians can accept the idea of justice as fairness (which the
procedure describes) because it realizes autonomy, utilitarians
because it promotes overall utility, Christians because it is part of
divine law, etc. But even here Rawls wanted to insist that adherents
of the competing visions of the good leave their particular
conceptions behind in <em>public</em> discourse and justify the
policies they endorse on grounds that are publicly accessible. He
described this as the citizen&rsquo;s duty of civility (<em>Political
Liberalism</em>, iv).</p>

<p>
Mention should be made of some movements that are not philosophical in
a professional sense, but are important in understanding the relation
between morality and religion. Liberation theology, of which a leading
spokesman from Latin America is Gustavo Guti&eacute;rrez (1928-), has
attempted to reconcile the Christian gospel with a commitment
(influenced by Marxist categories) to revolution to relieve the
condition of the oppressed. The civil rights movement (drawing heavily
on <em>Exodus</em>), feminist ethics, animal liberation, environmental
ethics, and the gay rights and children&rsquo;s rights movements have
shown special sensitivity to the moral status of particular oppressed
classes. The leadership of some of these movements has been
religiously committed, while the leadership of others has not. At the
same time, the notion of human rights, or justified claims by
<em>every</em> human being, has grown in global reach, partly through
the various instrumentalities of the United Nations. There has,
however, been less consensus on the question of how to
<em>justify</em> human rights. There are theological justifications,
deriving from the image of God in every human being, or the command to
love the neighbor, or the covenant between God and humanity (see
Wolterstorff, <em>Justice</em>: <em>Rights and Wrongs</em>, chapter
16). Whether there is a non-theological justification is a disputed
matter. Finally, there has also been a burst of activity in
professional ethics, such as medical ethics, engineering ethics, and
business ethics. This has not been associated with any one school of
philosophy rather than another. The connection of religion with these
developments has been variable. In some cases (e.g., medical ethics)
the initial impetus for the new sub-discipline was strongly influenced
by theology, and in other cases not.</p>

<p>
Two main disqualifiers of the project of relating morality intimately
to religion seemed to emerge in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. The first disqualifier was the prestige of natural science,
and the attempt to make it foundational for all human knowledge. The
various empiricist, verificationist, and reductionist forms of
foundationalism have not yet succeeded, and even within modern
philosophy there has been a continuous resistance to them. This is not
to say they will not succeed in the future (for example we may
discover a foundation for ethics in the theory of evolution), but the
confidence in their future success has waned. Forms of postmodern
thought that are prevalent today combine a distaste for
&lsquo;meta-narratives&rsquo; and a rejection of any form of
foundationalism. The effect on philosophical thinking about the
relation between morality and religion is two-fold. On the one hand,
the modernist rejection of religion on the basis of a foundationalist
empiricism is itself rejected. This makes the current climate more
hospitable to religious language than it was for most of the twentieth
century. But on the other hand, the distaste for over-arching theory
means that religious meta-narratives are suspect to the same degree as
any other, and the hospitality is more likely to be towards bits and
pieces of traditional theology than to any theological system as a
whole. Habermas uses the term &lsquo;post-secular age&rsquo; to
describe our current condition, in which the secularization hypothesis
(that religion was destined to wither away under the impact of science
and education) has apparently failed. Certainly parts of Western
Europe are less attached to traditional institutional forms of
religion. But taking the world as a whole, religion seems to be
increasing in influence rather than declining. The second main
disqualifier was the liberal idea (present in the narrative of this
entry from the time of the religious wars in Europe) that we need a
moral discourse based on reason and not religion in order to avoid the
hatred and bloodshed that religion seems to bring with it. Here the
response to Rawls has been telling. It seems false that we can respect
persons and at the same time tell them to leave their fundamental
commitments behind in public discourse, and it seems false also that
some purely rational but still action-guiding component can be
separated off from these competing substantive conceptions of the good
(see Wolterstorff, &ldquo;An Engagement with Rorty&rdquo;). It is true
that religious commitment can produce the deliberate targeting of
civilians in a skyscraper. But the history of the twentieth century
suggests that non-religious totalitarian regimes have at least as much
blood on their hands. Perhaps the truth is, as Kant saw, that people
under the Evil Maxim will use any available ideology for their
purposes. Progress towards civility is more likely if religious people
are encouraged to enter &lsquo;the public square&rsquo; <em>with</em>
their commitments explicit, and see how much common ethical ground
there in fact is. Progress seems more likely in this way than by
trying to construct a neutral philosophical ground that very few
people actually accept.</p>

<p>
One recent development in analytic ethical theory has been a revived
interest in the divine command theory, according to which the source,
constitution and binding force of morality, or at least of moral
obligation, are properly accounted for only by reference to divine
will or command. A pioneer in this movement was Philip Quinn&rsquo;s
<em>Divine Command and Moral Requirements</em> (1978). He defended the
theory against two core objections (one, deriving from Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Euthyprho</em>, that it makes morality arbitrary, and the second,
deriving from a misunderstanding of Kant, that it is inconsistent with
human autonomy), and proposed that we understand the relation between
God and moral rightness causally, rather than analyzing the terms of
moral obligation as <em>meaning</em> &lsquo;commanded by God&rsquo;.
Though we could stipulate such a definition, it would make it obscure
how theists and non-theists could have genuine moral discussion, as
they certainly seem to do. Robert M. Adams, in a series of articles
and then in <em>Finite and Infinite Goods</em> (1999), first separates
off the good (which he analyzes Platonically in terms of imitating the
ultimate good, which is God) and the right. He then defends a divine
command theory of the right by arguing that obligation is always
obligation <em>to</em> someone, and God is the most appropriate
person, given human limitations. John Hare, In <em>God and
Morality</em> (2007) and <em>Divine Command</em> (2015), defends a
version of the theory that derives from God&rsquo;s sovereignty and
defends the theory against the objection that obedience to divine
command itself requires justification. He also compares Christian,
Jewish and Muslim accounts of divine command. Linda Zagzebski&rsquo;s
<em>Divine Motivation Theory</em> (2004) proposes, as an alternative
to divine command theory, that we can understand all moral normativity
in terms of the notion of a good emotion, and that God&rsquo;s
emotion-like motives are the best exemplar.</p>

<p>
The long tradition of philosophical reflection on the virtues and
natural law has also experienced recent rejuvenation. Elizabeth
Anscombe&rsquo;s landmark essay &ldquo;Modern Moral Philosophy&rdquo;
(1958) went on the attack against Kantian-derived ethics, proclaiming
that &ldquo;the concepts of obligation, and duty&mdash;moral obligation and
moral duty, that is to say&mdash;and of what is morally right and wrong,
and of the moral sense of &lsquo;ought&rsquo;, ought to be
jettisoned.&rdquo; She argued that Aristotle had had no need for such
notions, and that modern conceptions of moral obligation reflected
divine law conceptions of ethics rendered incoherent by the
subtraction of a divine lawgiver. What ensued was an enthusiastic
retrieval of Aristotelian ethics in both theistic and non-theistic
forms. Virtue ethicists like Philippa Foot in <em>Natural
Goodness</em> (2001) and Rosalind Hursthouse in <em>On Virtue
Ethics</em> (1999) defend the virtues as perfective of human nature
without drawing on theistic premises. Linda Zagzebski&rsquo;s
<em>Divine Motivation Theory</em> (2004) develops a motivation-based
virtue ethics in which morality is driven by the attractiveness of
good exemplars, and God is the ultimate paradigm of goodness, revealed
in Jesus Christ. Theistic developments of virtue ethics are frequently
joined with some version of natural law theory. John Finnis, one of a
group of contemporary thinkers defending the so-called new natural
law, seeks to derive all of morality from a single first principle of
practical reason that receives specification through basic goods. The
principles of practical reason are claimed to be self-evident and are
applied to, not derived from, human nature. The new natural law theory
has elicited sharp critique from more Thomistic natural law thinkers
such as theologian Jean Porter, who in <em>Nature as Reason</em>
(2005) affirms the moral significance of human nature, including its
prerational dimensions, when understood in relation to the end of
action, the perfection of the human agent through the virtues, and
ultimately through the Vision of God. Alasdair MacIntyre, deeply
influenced by both Marxism and Aristotelian Thomism, holds that human
life has a fundamentally narrative shape. We find ourselves seeking to
coherently unite our various activities and roles and commitments.
That which can succeed in doing so is our final end. Given the
incompleteness and failure of all finite goods, he concludes that
&ldquo;a good life is one in which an agent, although continuing to
rank order particular and finite goods, treats none of these goods as
necessary for the completion of her or his life, so leaving her or
himself open to a final good beyond all such goods, a good desirable
beyond all such goods&rdquo; (<em>Ethics in the Conflicts of
Modernity</em>, 213). He thus goes some distance toward restoring an
ecstatic form of eudaimonism, according to which it is not the welfare
of the agent that justifies pursuit of the good, but the independent
goodness of that which draws the agent (Herdt, <em>Assuming
Responsibility</em>, ch. 4).</p>

<p>
As these recent developments indicate, while much contemporary ethical
reflection proceeds independently of religious concepts or
commitments, reflection on religion and on morality continue in many
quarters to be intimately connected in ways that are nourished by the
preceding millenia of reflection on these topics.</p>
