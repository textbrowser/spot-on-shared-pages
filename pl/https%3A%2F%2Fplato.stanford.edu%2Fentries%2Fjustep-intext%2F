<p>
There are two debates in epistemology that can be described as a
debate between internalists and externalists: a debate about
propositional knowledge and a debate about epistemic justification.
The debate about knowledge is primarily about whether propositional
knowledge requires some internal epistemic condition, an epistemic
condition (e.g., justification, rationality) that depends wholly upon
factors internal to the thinker and her perspective on the world.
Internalists claim that there is such a condition, arguing that it
would not be possible to know, say, unless the thinker has
sufficiently good reasons available to reflection (BonJour 1980).
Externalists about knowledge deny that there is any such condition,
either because they deny that knowledge requires epistemic conditions
like justification or rationality (Audi 1995; Kornblith 2008) or
because they deny that any such epistemic condition depends wholly
upon internal factors (Greco 2010; Williamson 2000). The disagreement
that is the focus of this entry is about whether the justification of
any thinker&rsquo;s beliefs might depend in part upon external
factors. Internalists about justification defend the view that
justification supervenes upon the internal. Externalists about
justification deny this. The debate touches upon questions about the
nature of normativity and about the role that rational excellence
plays in establishing a connection between thought and reality.</p>

<p>
The terms of the debate are clarified in &sect;1. In &sect;2 and
&sect;3, the most influential arguments for internalism and for
externalism about justification are presented. In &sect;4, we look at
different conceptions of justification.</p>

<h2 id="TerDeb">1. Terms of the Debates</h2>

<p>
These debates about knowledge and about justification are, <em>inter
alia</em>, disagreements about the connections between justification
and knowledge, as well as disagreements about what kinds of internal
conditions are necessary for knowledge and whether justification is
itself an internal condition (regardless of whether it is necessary
for knowledge). The &lsquo;external&rsquo; can be characterised
negatively as that which does not supervene upon the internal. The
internal is most often understood in <em>accessibilist</em> terms
(e.g., in terms of that which is reflectively accessible, or in terms
of factors that thinkers have privileged access to (Audi 2001;
Fumerton 1995)), or in <em>mentalist</em> terms (i.e., in terms of the
mental life of an individual thinker and that which supervenes upon
the mental (Conee and Feldman 2004)).</p>

<p>
A brief review of the early history is needed to clarify the terms of
the debate. Armstrong (1973) introduced the term
&lsquo;externalism&rsquo; into the literature as a way of picking out
theories of knowledge that implied that beliefs might sometimes
constitute knowledge without the support of a &lsquo;justificatory
argument&rsquo; (BonJour 1980). BonJour thought that only beliefs
supported by the elements of a justificatory argument might constitute
knowledge, but foundationalists thought that some knowledge might be
immediately available without reliance on such an argument, either
because (a) it seems plausible that certain forms of knowledge (e.g.,
knowledge of what we&rsquo;re thinking or doing (Anscombe 1962)) do
not require the support of any argument that the thinker could
potentially offer, or (b) because it seems that positing some
knowledge that does not need the support of a justificatory argument
is a good way of addressing the regress problem (Audi 1988a; Sosa
1980). Armstrong&rsquo;s externalist proposed that some knowledge
might be possible without the support of a justificatory argument
provided that certain &lsquo;natural&rsquo; relations connect a
thinker&rsquo;s beliefs to the situations that make those beliefs
true, but externalism can be understood more broadly as the view that
there are possible cases of propositional knowledge where no purely
internal epistemic condition (e.g., rationality, justification)
obtains.</p>

<p>
Notable examples of externalist theories of knowledge include the
proposals that knowledge is nothing more than true belief (Sartwell
1991; 1992), that knowing that <em>p</em> is a matter of the fact that
<em>p</em> being causally connected in the appropriate way with
believing that <em>p</em> (Goldman 1967), that knowledge is true
belief produced by belief-producing systems operative in the
environments for which they were well-designed (Millikan 1984;
Plantinga 1993), that knowledge is belief that &lsquo;tracks&rsquo;
the truth in the sense that the belief would not have been formed by
the operative methods had the belief been mistaken (Nozick 1981; Roush
2005), and that knowledge is belief based on &lsquo;conclusive
reasons&rsquo;, reasons a thinker would not have had if this belief
had been mistaken (Dretske 1971). The term &lsquo;externalism&rsquo;
seemed apt to describe these views because each view characterised
knowledge as a relation between a thinker and a fact that can obtain
even if the thinker had no available reasons or evidence to believe
that the relevant relation held between their beliefs and the
world.</p>

<p>
BonJour&rsquo;s (1980) influential critique of externalist theories of
knowledge was, <em>inter alia</em>, a critique of a picture of
justification according to which a thinker who meets the conditions of
the externalist theories like the ones sketched above would have
justification for her beliefs even if the internal conditions that
figure in internalist accounts of rationality or justification were
absent. His critique forced epistemologists to address three
questions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>The knowledge question:</strong> Is there any purely internal
epistemic condition that is necessary for propositional knowledge?</p>

<p>
<strong>The dependence question:</strong> Is justification necessary
for propositional knowledge?</p>

<p>
<strong>The justification question:</strong> Is justification a purely
internal epistemic condition?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If there is no consensus on how these questions should be answered, it
seems to make sense to distinguish the debate about justification from
the debate about knowledge. If someone were to answer the nexus
question by affirming that it is possible, by their lights, to have
knowledge without justification, they would see that there is a
coherent view according to which knowledge should be understood along
externalist lines <em>even if</em> justification is something that
depends wholly upon factors internal to the thinker.</p>

<p>
The debate about justification is typically understood as a debate
about a supervenience
 thesis.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Internalists maintain that there is a necessary connection between
internal conditions and justification: if two thinkers are internal
duplicates, the same things will be justified for them. Externalists
about justification reject this. Their view is defined negatively. The
debate about knowledge, by contrast, is not normally understood as a
disagreement about a supervenience thesis. Facts about knowledge would
only supervene upon facts about the internal if we assumed that
internal duplicates always know the same things. Given the standard
characterisations of the internal, internalism so formulated implies
that the scope of factual knowledge is limited to facts that supervene
upon the internal, but this view about the potential scope of human
knowledge is not widely accepted. The focus of this discussion will be
the debate between internalists and externalists about justification,
not knowledge.</p>

<p>
Note that philosophers of mind draw the line between the internal and
external in a completely different way. In philosophy of mind, we
might say that factors that are internal to an individual are internal
to the bodies of thinking animals (Burge 1979; Gertler 2015). Such
conditions that might have to do with the structure of organs or pH
levels of blood might be treated as internal by philosophers of mind
but external by epistemologists since they do not directly determine
what a thinker&rsquo;s perspective is like or because thinkers have no
reflective access to such conditions (i.e., they cannot determine
using introspection, reason, and memory of what is known in these ways
what our nervous system is like much less whether we have blood).</p>

<p>
If the external is characterised negatively (i.e., as that which is
not internal), every theory of knowledge and of justification can be
classified as internalist or externalist and no theory would be both.
Some authors speak of a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; externalist view if it
characterises some notion without using any internal conditions
(Srinivasan 2020). A view that implies that justification depends upon
a mixture of internal and external conditions can be classified as
externalist even if some authors prefer to describe the view as
&lsquo;an internalist externalism&rsquo; (Alston 1988a).</p>

<p>
The debate is primarily concerned with <em>propositional</em>
justification rather than <em>doxastic</em> justification. Ascriptions
of propositional justification do not presuppose or entail that the
thinker holds the relevant belief (e.g., given the evidence, there
might be a justification for Alice to believe that housing prices will
go up even if she has not processed this evidence and drawn any
conclusions on the matter). Ascriptions of doxastic justification do
presuppose or entail that the thinker has the belief in question
(e.g., if Alice justifiably believes something about the price of
housing, she has to have a belief about it, she must have a
justification to form this belief, and the belief itself must be based
on the right kinds of factors to be justified). Doxastic justification
seems to involve a basing relation that, in turn, might involve a
causal connection between beliefs and other states of mind (Korcz
1997; Silva and Oliveira 2024). Because of this, there might be an
external element in doxastic justification (e.g., causal links between
internal factors) even if propositional justification is an
internalist notion. For this reason, many internalists focus on
propositional justification.</p>

<p>
How do epistemologists characterise the internal and the external?
There are two standard characterisations, as mentioned above. Internal
conditions are sometimes understood as those that supervene upon a
thinker&rsquo;s mental life (Conee and Feldman 2004; Wedgwood 2002).
If two thinkers are perfectly alike in terms of the relevant aspects
of their mental lives, they will be internally similar. The
<em>mentalist</em> believes that justification supervenes upon the
internal where the internal is understood as that which supervenes
upon relevant aspects of a thinker&rsquo;s mental life. On this view,
any difference in what two thinkers have justification to believe at
any time requires a suitable difference in their respective mental
lives at the relevant times. Internal conditions are sometimes
understood instead in terms of what is accessible to the thinker
(i.e., as that which is available to the thinker via reflection or
introspection). The <em>accessibilist</em> believes that justification
supervenes upon internal conditions that are understood to be
accessible. On this view, if there is any difference in what two
thinkers have justification to believe at any given time, there must
be some difference in what conditions they have access to at the
relevant times (Fumerton 1995; Smithies 2012a).</p>

<p>
It is not obvious that these characterisations of the internal and
external are equivalent. There might be aspects of a thinker&rsquo;s
mental life that are not accessible. It might be controversial whether
that which is accessible to an individual is limited to that
individual&rsquo;s mental life (Gibbons 2006; McDowell 1994;
Williamson 2000). A further complicating factor is that there might be
aspects of a thinker&rsquo;s mental life that the mentalist wants to
deny might matter to justification. What if knowledge is itself a
mental state in its own right so there is a mental difference between
someone who knows that the snow has started to fall and someone who
believes but doesn&rsquo;t know this (Gibbons 2001; Nagel 2013;
Williamson 2000)? What if perceptions are of a different psychological
kind than hallucinations no matter how similar these conscious
episodes might seem to those undergoing them (Hinton 1973; Logue 2012;
Martin 2004; McDowell 1994)? Few epistemologists who want to be
described as &lsquo;internalist&rsquo; want to say that there is an
internal difference between any thinker who knows some proposition and
any other thinker who could not know this proposition (but see
McDowell 1995). There is controversy as to whether the mentalist
should be troubled by the possibility that there might be aspects of a
thinker&rsquo;s mental life relevant to justification that are not
accessible to that thinker (Vahid 2011; Puddifoot 2016).</p>

<p>
According to the accessibilist, the conditions that determine what a
thinker has justification to believe at any given time are the ones
accessible to her at that time. Prominent accessibilists have defended
different views about what it is that thinkers have access to. For
some, we have access to the grounds, reasons, or evidence that provide
(or diminish) rational support (Audi 2001). A less modest view is that
thinkers have access to whether there is (adequate) justification for
them to believe the propositions they grasp (Chisholm 1988; Ginet
1975; Smithies 2012a). It will simplify discussion to think of
accessibilism in terms of access to that which provides rational
support. To explicate the notion of access, some authors appeal to the
idea of acquaintance (Fumerton 1988) and some to the idea of what is
made available via introspection and reflection (Audi 2001).</p>

<h2 id="ArgForInt">2. Arguments for Internalism</h2>

<p>
In this section, the most influential arguments for internalism about
justification are presented and examined.</p>

<h3 id="ClaUnuFac">2.1 Clairvoyance and Unusual Faculties</h3>

<p>
BonJour provides one of the first intuition pumps used to criticise
externalism about knowledge, a view that he took to have implausible
implications about the nature of justification and its role in
securing knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Norman</strong>: Norman, under certain conditions that usually
obtain, is a completely reliable clairvoyant with respect to certain
kinds of subject matter. He possesses no evidence or reasons of any
kind for or against the general possibility of such a cognitive power,
or for or against the thesis that he possesses it. One day Norman
comes to believe that the President is in New York City, though he has
no evidence either for or against this belief. In fact the belief is
true and results from his clairvoyant power, under circumstances in
which it is completely reliable. (BonJour 1980: 62)
</blockquote>

<p>
BonJour hoped to use the example to elicit intuitive support for
(P3):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Argument from Clairvoyance</em></p>

<p>
P1. Externalist views of knowledge imply that the external conditions
that suffice for turning a belief into knowledge suffice for
justification.</p>

<p>
P2. Externalist views about knowledge imply that Norman&rsquo;s
beliefs constitute knowledge.</p>

<p>
C1. Thus, externalism about knowledge implies that Norman&rsquo;s
beliefs are justified.</p>

<p>
P3. Norman&rsquo;s beliefs, however, are not justified.</p>

<p>
C. Externalist views of knowledge are mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similar examples involving beliefs produced by unusual faculties can
be found elsewhere in the literature (Lehrer 1990).</p>

<p>
Externalists about justification have two avenues of response. They
might defend the view that Norman&rsquo;s beliefs are justified or
deny that their views imply that Norman&rsquo;s beliefs are justified.
To support the idea that Norman has justification to believe, some
externalists have pointed to examples that elicit intuitions less
unfavourable to the externalist:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Racist Dinner Table</strong>: Nour, a young British woman of
Arab descent, is invited to dinner at the home of a white friend from
university. The host, Nour&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s father, is polite
and welcoming to Nour. He is generous with the food and wine, and asks
Nour a series of questions about herself. Everyone laughs and talks
amiably. As Nour comes away, however, she is unable to shake the
conviction that her friend&rsquo;s father is racist against Arabs. But
replaying the evening in her head she finds it impossible to recover
just what actions on the host&rsquo;s part could be thought to be
racist, or what would justify her belief in the host&rsquo;s racism.
If pressed, Nour would say she &ldquo;just knows&rdquo; that her host
is racist. In fact the host is racist&mdash;he thinks of Arabs as
inherently fanatical, dangerous, and backward&mdash;and as a result
sent off subtle cues that Nour subconsciously registered and
processed. It is this subconscious sensitivity that led to
Nour&rsquo;s belief that her host is racist. (Srinivasan 2020: 396)
</blockquote>

<p>
Srinivasan thinks that in Racist Dinner Table, we should say that Nour
knows that the host is racist and, in turn, that Nour&rsquo;s beliefs
are justified.</p>

<p>
Externalists might resist BonJour&rsquo;s argument by rejecting (P1).
They might argue that their view carries no commitment to the claim
that Norman or Nour has justification for their beliefs. Some might be
prepared to attribute knowledge to these subjects while maintaining
that reflection on similar examples suggests that some knowers might
believe propositions that would not be rational to believe. Examples
involving chicken-sexers (i.e., thinkers who have the ability to
reliably sort male and female chicks into different groups without any
idea how it is that they manage to do this thanks, presumably, to some
cues that are not consciously identifiable that explain the
non-accidental success of their sorting decisions) have convinced some
that it might be possible to know a proposition without justifiably or
rationally believing that proposition (Foley 1987: 168). There is no
consensus on whether knowledge requires rational belief or
justification (Lasonen-Aarnio 2010). Alternatively, they might agree
that having justification to believe <em>p</em> is a condition on
knowing <em>p</em>, but argue that justification (and knowledge)
requires a combination of the right internal and external conditions
(Sosa 2003). Recall that externalism about justification is the thesis
that justification does not supervene upon the internal. Externalism
about justification is not equivalent to &lsquo;pure
externalism&rsquo;. Externalism is compatible with the idea that
Norman&rsquo;s beliefs would only be justified if certain internal and
external conditions are met. Many virtue reliabilists, for example,
believe that justification requires a reliability condition (which is
an external factor) as well as a virtue-condition that seems to
implicate subjective factors like those that figure in many
internalist accounts of justification (Sosa 1991; Greco 1999; Miracchi
2017). The intuitions BonJour hopes to elicit do not speak against a
wide range of possible and actual externalist views even if they pose
a threat to pure externalism.</p>

<h3 id="NorChaJus">2.2 The Normative Character of Justification</h3>

<p>
Internalists sometimes say that externalists do not do justice to the
normative character of justification. This is one way of trying to
capture this idea:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Deontologist&rsquo;s Argument for Internalism</em></p>

<p>
P1. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internal duplicates and they form
the same beliefs in the same ways, <em>A</em> meets her epistemic
duties iff <em>B</em> meets her epistemic duties.</p>

<p>
P2. A thinker has justification to believe <em>p</em> when she can
form this belief without failing to meet her epistemic duties.</p>

<p>
C. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internally alike, <em>A</em> will
have justification to believe <em>p</em> iff <em>B</em> has
justification to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Epistemologists often characterise justification in broadly
deontological terms, saying that justified beliefs are beliefs that we
ought to hold (Conee and Feldman 2004) or that justified beliefs are
the ones we can hold whilst discharging our epistemic duties (Steup
2001).</p>

<p>
Critics of the argument might respond in one of two ways. First, some
question the idea that justification should be understood in terms of
duty. According to one influential line of criticism, it would be
better to characterise justification in evaluative terms (i.e.,
something that would be good to have from the epistemic point of view)
because thinkers do not have the right kind of control over their
beliefs to have epistemic duties or obligations (Alston 1988b). This
is a problem because many are convinced that thinkers do not have
voluntary control over their beliefs (Bennett 1990; Hieronymi 2009;
Winters 1979). Debates about whether deontological theories of
justification require voluntary control continue (Chuard and Southwood
2009; Hieronymi 2008).</p>

<p>
Second, some question whether deontologism favours internalism
(Bergmann 2006; Littlejohn 2012; Sutton 2007; Williamson 2007;
Srinivasan 2020). There are live debates about whether moral duties or
the justification of action should be understood along internalist
lines (i.e., that internally similar agents have the same duties and
the same actions would be justified for them) (P. A. Graham 2010;
Thomson 2003). Similarly, there are ongoing debates in the philosophy
of law whether agents who are internally similar to agents who act
with justification in self-defence cases likewise have justification
or merely an excuse to act in similar ways if faced by a merely
apparent threat (Baron 2007; Moore 1997). As it is controversial in
other normative domains whether internal duplicates will always do
equally well in discharging their duties if they act the same way, it
is unsurprising that some externalists feel free to describe their
views in deontological terms.</p>

<p>
Internalists might offer an alternative characterisation of the
normative character of justification (e.g., by linking justification
to responsibility) or provide further arguments for thinking that
normative notions used to characterise justification (e.g., duty) must
be understood along internalist lines. If they pursue the first
option, they might shift away from talk of duty towards responsibility
(Naylor 1988) or rationality (Wedgwood 2002) and argue that
justification (so understood) should be understood along internalist
lines because responsibility or rationality should be understood as
internalist notions.</p>

<p>
Internalists who want to link justification to responsibility (either
to explicate the notion of duty or to shift away from thinking of
justification in terms of duty) might offer this responsibilist
argument:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Responsibilist&rsquo;s Argument for Internalism</em></p>

<p>
P1. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internal duplicates and they form
the same beliefs in the same ways, <em>A</em> is blameless for her
beliefs iff <em>B</em> is blameless.</p>

<p>
P2. If neither <em>A</em> nor <em>B</em> can be blamed or held
responsible for forming their beliefs, neither failed to fulfill their
epistemic duties by forming these beliefs.</p>

<p>
P3. A thinker has justification to believe when she can form these
beliefs without failing to meet her epistemic duties.</p>

<p>
C. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internally alike, <em>A</em> will
have justification to believe iff <em>B</em> has justification to
believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Responsibilists about justification think that believing responsibly
or blamelessly is sufficient either for believing in ways that is
consistent with discharging our epistemic duties or for justification.
Does this argument avoid the difficulties with the
deontologist&rsquo;s argument for internalism?</p>

<p>
Externalists respond in two ways. Some might grant (P1), but question
(P2). As they see it, even if a thinker forms her beliefs in
responsible ways, she might nevertheless violate a norm or fail to
meet some standard and do so excusably. Following Austin (1956), they
might maintain that excuses and justifications can both shield an
individual from blame or responsibility whilst insisting that the
former is insufficient for the latter. Some externalists have argued
that internalism about responsibility or blamelessness is compatible
with externalism about justification (Littlejohn 2012; Sutton 2007;
Williamson forthcoming).</p>

<p>
The first premise, (P1), is also controversial. Internalism is
typically understood as a time-slice view (i.e., that the internal
conditions that determine whether a thinker has justification to
believe at a time are limited to those conditions that obtain at that
very time). Some externalists have argued that conditions that
obtained in the past might matter to whether a belief is responsibly
held now. Imagine two ways that Sally might have come to believe that
broccoli is healthy: she might have read this somewhere reputable (the
good case) or she might have come to believe this by relying on a
clearly disreputable source (the bad case). We often retain a belief
without storing the evidence on which it was originally based. It
might seem that in the good case version, Sally might responsibly
believe now the things that she responsibly believed initially. In the
bad case, Sally might now be internally just like Sally is in the good
case, but it might seem that her belief is not now responsibly held
since it was not responsibly formed initially. Losing the grounds or
information that Sally originally based her belief on does not seem to
some externalists to &lsquo;turn&rsquo; an irresponsibly formed belief
into one that she can now responsibly hold (Goldman 1999). It should
be noted that not all internalists find these sorts of cases
convincing. Feldman and Conee (2001) think that the bad case might be
a case of justification because things like the &lsquo;conscious
qualities&rsquo; of her recollection might serve to justify her belief
even when the belief was not initially based on adequate grounds.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is the rationalist argument for justification:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>From Internalism about Rationality to Internalism about
Justification</em></p>

<p>
P1. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internal duplicates and they form
the same beliefs in the same ways, <em>A</em> rationally believes iff
<em>B</em> rationally believes.</p>

<p>
P2. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are both rational in holding their
beliefs, both of their beliefs are justified.</p>

<p>
C. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are internally alike, <em>A</em> will
have justification to believe iff <em>B</em> has justification to
believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Both premises are controversial. It would not be uncommon for
externalists to question (P2) on the grounds that they doubt that the
epistemic status we describe using the language of rationality is the
same as the status we describe using the language of justification.
Reliabilists like Bach (1985), Engel (1992b), and Goldman (1986) have
said that their theories of justification are not meant to be theories
of rational belief. Other externalists have suggested that rationality
might differ from justification in an important way. It seems not to
be a rational failure to form beliefs provided that the available
information or apparent reasons have been processed correctly, but
justification might require something further or something else (e.g.,
being supported by genuine reasons rather than merely apparent ones,
being appropriate given facts that the individual might have
overlooked, forgotten, or been non-culpably ignorant of). For further
discussion of possible differences between rationality and
justification, see Littlejohn (2012), Siscoe (2021), and Sylvan
(2018).</p>

<p>
Internalists push back against this line in one of two ways. Cohen
(1984) says that terms like &lsquo;justified&rsquo; and
&lsquo;rational&rsquo; are essentially synonyms. He adds that even if
we doubt or deny this, there is no denying that the notion that has
interested many epistemologists is the notion of rationality. Gibbons
(2013) argues that justification and rationality ultimately come to
the same thing, defending a view according to which the requirements
of rationality are normative in such a way that it would be impossible
to deny the equivalence. (Similar views about the normativity of
rationality have been defended by Kiesewetter (2017) and Lord
(2018).)</p>

<p>
Internalists often argue that externalism cannot capture the idea that
justification or justification-conferring factors are supposed to
provide a thinker with guidance. Some philosophers think that whatever
has normative significance must be able to provide guidance and that
this favours an internalist approach to guidance. Ginet (1975) argues
that a thinker must be able to tell that justification is absent on
the grounds that in any situation in which a thinker should respond in
some way, she must be able to respond in that way. Huemer argues for
something similar:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; there cannot be a pair of cases in which everything seems to
a subject to be the same in all epistemically relevant respects, and
yet the subject ought, rationally, to take different doxastic
attitudes in the two cases&mdash;for instance, in one case to affirm a
proposition and in the other to withhold. (Huemer 2006)
</blockquote>

<p>
If these arguments succeed, what kind of internalism do they support?
They might be taken to support the relatively modest idea that the
grounds that determine what we have justification to believe are
accessible to the thinker, or the more demanding view that we also
have access to the adequacy or inadequacy of the accessible grounds
that determine what there is justification to believe:</p>

<blockquote>
The internalist assumes that, merely by reflecting upon his own
conscious state, he can formulate a set of epistemic principles that
will enable him to find out, with respect to any possible belief he
has, whether he is <em>justified</em> in having that belief. (Chisholm
1988: 286)
</blockquote>

<p>
Many have argued that internalists and externalists alike should agree
that a thinker might be under a requirement to respond in some way (or
refrain from so doing) even if they are not in a position to know this
response is required (Littlejohn 2012; Sorensen 1995; Srinivasan
2015b; Williamson 2000). If this is right, that might suggest that
there are important normative notions that do not provide the kind of
guidance the internalist alleges must be provided by any genuinely
normative notion. Suppose there is a norm that enjoins someone to
refrain from <em>X</em>-ing if condition <em>C</em> obtains (e.g., if
we are angry, we should not to go bed; if we do not have a
sufficiently high degree of rational confidence, we should not
believe; if we do not feel cold, we should not turn on the heat; if
the radio is too loud, we should not turn it louder). Even if some
agent had perfect knowledge of the norms governing belief, this agent
still might not be able to discern in her present situation what she
would be required to do if she couldn&rsquo;t be certain that
<em>C</em> obtains whenever it does, and that suggests that the norms
that have <em>C</em> as an application condition do not provide the
kind of guidance thought to be built into normative notions. Some have
argued that even internal conditions are not luminous (Williamson
2000). Debates about whether there are any luminous conditions persist
(Berker 2008; Srinivasan 2015a). There are continued attempts to show
that the presence or absence of justification is something that we can
always know or, at least, have justification to form beliefs about
(Kiesewetter 2016; Smithies 2012a).</p>

<h3 id="EviJus">2.3 Evidence and Justification</h3>

<p>
Some epistemologists appeal to theories of evidence to motivate
internalism. According to contemporary evidentialists, a
thinker&rsquo;s evidence completely determines what she has
justification to believe (Adler 2002; Conee and Feldman 2004; McCain
2014). If a thinker has sufficient evidence for believing <em>p</em>,
she has a justification to believe <em>p</em>. If, however, a thinker
has a justification to believe <em>p</em>, she must have evidence that
provides adequate support for this belief. Given the connection
between evidence and justification, some internalists might argue that
internalism about evidence supports internalism about justification
(Silins 2005):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>From Evidentialism to Internalism</em></p>

<p>
P1. It is impossible for there to be differences in the justification
there is for two thinkers if these thinkers have the same total
evidence.</p>

<p>
P2. It is impossible for two thinkers to differ in terms of their
total evidence if they are internally indiscernible.</p>

<p>
C. Thus, it is impossible for there to be differences in the
justification there is for two thinkers if they are internally
indiscernible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The literature contains very different responses to this kind of
argument. Some object to the argument by questioning the first
premise, (P1). Philosophers interested in knowledge of our own actions
(Anscombe 1957), knowledge of our own bodies (Anscombe 1962),
perceptual knowledge (Austin 1962; Brewer 2011; Davidson 1986; McGinn
2012; Travis 2013), and memorial knowledge (Audi 1995; Malcolm 1963;
Moon 2012) have argued that there are forms of propositional knowledge
that do not require supporting evidence. Whilst Audi describes this
kind of knowledge as knowledge without justification, some think of
these cases as cases where something provides justification without
furnishing the thinker with evidence that in turn secures this
normative status. Additionally, some externalists challenge (P1) on
the grounds that the combination of internalism and evidentialism
supports a kind of scepticism that most contemporary epistemologists
reject (Greco 2000).</p>

<p>
(P2) is also controversial. Some argue for evidential internalism by
appeal to considerations about basing. A common suggestion is that
there is propositional justification to believe when a thinker&rsquo;s
evidence gives them the support needed to properly believe something
and that doxastic justification requires that our beliefs are based on
good reasons or evidence. Philosophers often say that an
individual&rsquo;s responses are based on some grounds or evidence
only if they are causally connected in the appropriate way to these
grounds or evidence (Davidson 1963; Korcz 1997). Some philosophers
then argue that the (proximate) causes of our beliefs are always
internal factors (Huemer 2007; Wedgwood 2002). Because of this,
evidential internalism might seem quite plausible. It might suggest
that the only rational bases we can have for our beliefs consists of
evidence that supervenes upon internal factors. These arguments have
been resisted in a number of ways. Some philosophers think that our
talk of a basis is ambiguous between a causal-explanatory basis and an
evidential basis (Swain 1979). Some would argue that a thinker&rsquo;s
basis must be the kind of thing that might be identical to good
reasons to believe (where these are sometimes facts about the
situation that do not supervene upon internal conditions) (Dancy 2000;
Alvarez 2010) and others defend views on which the good reasons must
only be suitably related to subject&rsquo;s reasons for responding
that way (Mantel 2018; Mitova 2017). It might be enough, for example,
that the subject&rsquo;s reasons represent the good reasons there are
for responding that way.</p>

<p>
Difficulties for (P2) arise when we try to give an informative account
of what a thinker&rsquo;s evidence might be. If we understand the
internal in terms of the accessible, it seems that the evidential
internalist might be committed to two claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Positive Accessibility:</strong> If something is part of the
thinker&rsquo;s evidence, the thinker has reflective access to it.</p>

<p>
<strong>Negative Access:</strong> If something is <em>not</em> part of
the thinker&rsquo;s evidence, the thinker can tell by reflection that
it is not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On a (non-factive) mentalist understanding of the internal, the
evidential internalist has to say that a thinker&rsquo;s evidence
supervenes upon her non-factive mental states. Arguments for
identifying a thinker&rsquo;s evidence with her knowledge present
difficulties for both views:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>E=K:</strong> A thinker&rsquo;s evidence includes <em>p</em>
iff the thinker knows that <em>p.</em> (Hyman 2006; Williamson 2000)
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the modest anti-sceptical assumption that the scope of our
knowledge includes facts that are not reflectively accessible (e.g.,
facts about external objects we see, facts about events we remember),
it seems that E=K conflicts with Positive Accessibility. E=K also
presents problems for Negative Access. Suppose that Agnes knows that
she has limbs and her brain in a vat counterpart falsely believes that
it has limbs. Whilst Agnes&rsquo;s evidence, according to E=K, would
include the known fact, the brain in a vat counterpart cannot tell by
reflection that its evidence does not include the fact that it has
limbs. The conflicts between non-sceptical assumptions, E=K, and
(non-factive) mentalism should now also be apparent. While
(non-factive) mentalists are not committed to Positive or Negative
Access, they are committed to the claim that thinkers in the same
non-factive mental states must have the same evidence. Given E=K, that
commits them to the sceptical view that we can never know more about
the external world that our non-factive mental duplicates can.</p>

<p>
E=K is highly controversial. The (non-factive) mentalists reject it
(Conee and Feldman 2008; McCain 2014). Some object to E=K on the
grounds that the kind of accidental connections between believers and
facts that preclude knowledge do not prevent us from acquiring
evidence. In fake barn cases, for example, it might seem that we
cannot know that the building we see is a barn, but perhaps this does
not prevent us from acquiring as evidence the fact that it is a barn
(Hughes 2014; Locke 2015; Mitova 2017). (This description of the case
is controversial (Schellenberg 2018).) Someone sceptical of evidential
internalism might observe that weaker views than E=K spell trouble for
the view. Taking the modest anti-sceptical assumption that we have
some immediate knowledge of the external world for granted, the
evidential internalist must deny (at least) one of the following
claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Weak Propositionality:</strong> Some evidence is
propositional.</p>

<p>
<strong>Factivity:</strong> All propositional evidence consists of
true propositions or facts.</p>

<p>
<strong>Immediacy:</strong> Anything known non-inferentially belongs
to a thinker&rsquo;s evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some philosophers reject Weak Propositionality and maintain that a
thinker&rsquo;s evidence supervenes upon the thinker&rsquo;s
non-factive mental states because the thinker&rsquo;s evidence
<em>consists</em> of the thinker&rsquo;s mental states (Conee and
Feldman 2008; Turri 2009; Mitova 2017; Gibbons 2010). This approach
conflicts with the idea that a thinker&rsquo;s evidence should include
the kinds of things that figure as premises in inferential reasoning,
but it at least preserves some connection between evidence and that
which figures in reasoning in some sense. (Neta (2008) and Williamson
(2000) provide defences of Weak Propositionality.) Some object to this
psychologised approach to evidence on the grounds that it deprives us
of too much evidence to make sense of our ordinarily optimistic
assessments of the things we have justification to believe when we
lose our original evidence (Goldman 1999). This problem might seem
particularly pressing for views that identify a thinker&rsquo;s
evidence with her experiences and conscious states as it seems to
suggest that we lack justification for our beliefs when dreamlessly
sleeping (Moon 2018).</p>

<p>
An alternative strategy for developing the evidential internalist view
is to embrace Weak Propositionality and allow that a thinker&rsquo;s
evidence includes propositions about things external to the subject
and her perspective on the world but allow that this evidence might be
constituted by false propositions (Comesana and McGrath 2016; Fantl
and McGrath 2012). On this proposal, a thinker who sees a red thing in
her surroundings might have this in her evidence: that this object is
red. If some second thinker has a similar conscious experience but
sees a non-red object that appears red, she might still have this in
her evidence: that this object is red. The fact that this proposition
is false in the second scenario does not prevent that proposition from
being included in this thinker&rsquo;s evidence (e.g., the contents of
experiences that we have no reason to distrust might be part of our
evidence whether they happen to be true or false). Thus, we might
agree with Williamson that what a subject knows directly (e.g., via
perception) is included in her evidence but then insist that if we
hold fixed certain subjective aspects of a second thinker&rsquo;s
mental life and subtract away external conditions (e.g., accuracy, a
non-accidental connection between our mental states and the facts)
this second thinker&rsquo;s evidence remains the same. Some object to
the introduction of false reasons or false evidence on broadly
linguistic grounds (Unger 1975). One might also worry that the
introduction of false evidence might require a revision to some
standard assumptions about the way rational thinkers update their
beliefs in light of new evidence. When thinkers conditionalise on
their evidence, the evidence that they update on is learned with
certainty and will remain certain as new evidence is acquired. It is
difficult to see why something would have this status when
conceptually sophisticated thinkers would be cognisant of the fact
that the evidence they acquire and update on might be false.
Alternative update rules and the costs and benefits of their adoption
have been explored in the literature (Das 2022; Gallow 2021;
Schoenfield 2017). One further worry concerns the problem of
inconsistent evidence (Littlejohn and Dutant 2022; Williamson 2000).
It is not clear how the defenders of the non-factive view can rule out
the possibility of inconsistent evidence, but it is also not clear how
an inconsistent body of propositions might support some things and not
others if this body of evidence entails everything.</p>

<p>
A third option (which preserves Weak Propositionality and Factivity)
is to introduce a restriction that in effect precludes the possibility
that a thinker&rsquo;s evidence includes any propositions that pertain
to external objects or events. If a thinker&rsquo;s evidence consisted
entirely of propositions about the thinker&rsquo;s present mental
life, the problems from above might not arise. This view might seem to
be overly sceptical to some. It also might be objected that this view
gets the subject matter of our evidence wrong as it often pertains to
external things and their properties rather than things internal to
the thinker (Comesana and McGrath 2016). Given the weak assumption
that that which is known directly is part of our evidence, this view
forces us to either deny that knowledge of the external world is
possible or insist that it is only made possible via inference. It
might seem particularly difficult to see how we can make sense of
optimistic claims about the possibility of knowledge of the past if
the evidential basis for all beliefs about history consist of things
we can know immediately about our present mental lives. It should also
be noted that this picture of evidence is the target of
McDowell&rsquo;s (1994; 1995) critique of the &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo;
view of knowledge. McDowell rejects the idea that a suitable theory of
the knowledge relation will describe knowledge as a combination of
independent factors where part of standing in that relation is a
matter of having adequate reason and part of it has to do with
accurately matching the world. For further discussion of
McDowell&rsquo;s epistemological disjunctivism, see Conee and Feldman
2008 and Pritchard 2012.</p>

<h3 id="NewEviDemObj">2.4 The New Evil Demon Objection</h3>

<p>
The new evil demon objection was initially used to show that the
connection to the truth that justification provides should
<em>not</em> be understood in terms of reliability (Lehrer and Cohen
1983; Cohen 1984; Foley 1985). Consider the reliabilist view that says
that justification requires, <em>inter alia</em>, that the processes
that produce our beliefs are sufficiently reliable in the environments
in which they produce our beliefs (Goldman 1979). We assume that those
processes are reliable in the environments in which they are actually
used, but let&rsquo;s imagine a subject internally like us who comes
to believe what they do because a Cartesian demon has manipulated
things so that the internal states that dispose this subject to
believe what we do are not connected to the external realities that
these beliefs concern. The internalists think that it is intuitive to
say here that the deceived subject is just as justified as we are in
forming the beliefs that they do.</p>

<p>
One conclusion that might be taken from this is that justification
does not require reliability where reliability is understood in terms
of the ratio of success to failure in the environments in which the
processes were operative. Some externalists say that their views are
immune to these examples (Bergmann 2006), but we might draw a more
general lesson from this example; namely, that justification
supervenes upon the internal factors that are common to subjects in
good cases (i.e., subjects who acquire knowledge by relying on
accurate observations and memories) and the bad cases (i.e., subjects
who cannot acquire knowledge because appearances are not connected to
reality in the right way and consequently will either get things wrong
systematically or only get things right by luck) (Wedgwood 2002).
Because of this, it is not clear whether externalists can remain true
to their views while promising to vindicate the intuitive verdicts
that internalists appeal to. (For an argument that this thought
experiment needs to be formulated with care to test externalist
theories, see Gerken 2018).</p>

<p>
The argument against externalism about justification might be stated
like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The new evil demon argument</em></p>

<p>
P1. When we compare subjects who know or justifiably believe to their
internal duplicates stipulated to be systematically deceived, these
subjects seem equally justified.</p>

<p>
P2. On externalist views, some external condition that is supposed to
be necessary for justification is missing in the situations where our
duplicates are systematically deceived.</p>

<p>
C. Thus, these externalist views are mistaken because they mistakenly
imply that these internal duplicates of ours are not justified in
their beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Externalists typically respond by denying that the deceived subjects
have justification, trying to formulate views that accommodate the
intuitions that underwrite the objection, or by conceding that the
internalist is right about something whilst insisting that there is
some important notion that depends upon external factors.</p>

<p>
Some reliabilists respond by saying that justification requires
reliability but then offering an account of reliability according to
which a reliable process does not necessarily produce a sufficiently
high ratio of true to false beliefs in the environment in which it is
operative. Goldman, for example, has suggested that to test whether a
belief is justified, we should see whether the processes that produced
it would be reliable in &lsquo;normal&rsquo; environments, ones that
fit with our general beliefs about how our world works (Goldman 1986:
107). The situation in which the demon is operative is not normal, but
it might be that the processes operative would produce more desirable
outcomes in normal environments. Majors and Sawyer (2005) suggest that
justification requires reliability in &lsquo;home worlds&rsquo; (i.e.,
environments in which the contents of our thoughts are determined).
(For further refinements of the simple construal of reliability, see
P. J. Graham 2017; Henderson and Horgan 2011; Sosa 1993.) While these
responses retain a role for some notion of reliability in the theory
of justification, internalists might wonder whether these views do
justice to internalist intuitions if, in the end, the view denies that
the conditions necessary for justification supervene upon internal
factors. Externalists might wonder whether these reliabilist views
stay true to the considerations that made reliabilism attractive
(Lyons 2013). Not all reliabilists agree we should modify the notion
of reliability to accommodate the intuitions that support (P1) (Bach
1985; Engel 1992b).</p>

<p>
Some externalists reject (P1) because they think that only subjects in
the good case have adequate reasons for their beliefs. This position
is often associated with epistemological disjunctivists. Some such
disjunctivists would argue that the reasons we acquire when we have
genuine perceptual contact with our surroundings are different from
and superior to the we might acquire when hallucinating (Brewer 1997;
McDowell 1995; Neta and Pritchard 2007; Schellenberg 2016).</p>

<p>
Typically, externalists who reject (P1) agree that it is important to
say something to accommodate or explain away the intuitions that seem
to support (P1). Some have suggested that internalists who accept (P1)
are conflating two kinds of epistemic evaluation and, relatedly, two
notions of justification. Just as some ethicists think that the
evaluations of agents and their actions ought to be carefully
distinguished, some epistemologists suggest that we should take care
to distinguish the evaluation of <em>belief</em> from the evaluation
of the <em>believer</em> (Bach 1985; Engel 1992b; Lowy 1978). If even
the most conscientious, capable, and careful believer might form an
unjustified belief (e.g., in particularly challenging situations), it
might be fitting to positively evaluate the believer without
positively evaluating the believer&rsquo;s belief. Critics say that
this response fails because ascriptions of personal and doxastic
justification are more intimately connected than these authors suggest
(Kvanvig and Menzel 1990).</p>

<p>
Externalists have also claimed that internalists are conflating
justification (which is not an internalist notion by their lights)
with some other epistemic notion that might be an internalist notion.
For example, some epistemologists will say that internal duplicates
are alike in terms of what is <em>rational</em> for them to believe,
<em>reasonable</em> to believe, or <em>responsible</em> for them to
believe while allowing or insisting that these judgments might not
imply that the relevant beliefs would be <em>justified</em> (Bach
1985; Engel 1992b; Sutton 2007; Wedgwood 2002). Relatedly, some have
argued that internalists are mistakenly classifying excusable norm
violations as justified (Littlejohn 2012; Williamson forthcoming).
There is considerable controversy about how we should draw the
distinction between justification and excuse and apply that
distinction in an epistemic setting (Boult 2017; Brown 2018; Fantl and
McGrath 2012). Internalists often claim there is no difference between
thinking of beliefs as justified and thinking of them as rational,
reasonable, or responsible (Gibbons 2010; Langsam 2008; Naylor 1988).
As Cohen remarked in one of the earliest presentations of the
example:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; and &lsquo;rational&rsquo; are
virtual synonyms for &lsquo;justified&rsquo;. But we need not quibble
over semantics. If the Reliabilist wants to distinguish
&lsquo;justified&rsquo; from &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rational&rsquo; he may do so. But clearly the important
epistemic concept, the one epistemologists have been concerned with,
is what the Reliabilist would call &lsquo;reasonability&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rationality&rsquo;. (Cohen 1984: 284)
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ArgForExt">3. Arguments for Externalism</h2>

<p>
We will examine some of the most influential arguments for externalism
about justification.</p>

<h3 id="TruCon">3.1 The Truth-Connection</h3>

<p>
An early argument for externalism about justification appealed to
observations about the connection between justification and truth
(Alston 1988a; Engel 1992b; Goldman 1986; Swain 1985; Vision 2005).
Consider three observations about justification:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; cognitive justification is the sort of justification which
distinguishes true belief that is knowledge from true belief that is
little more than a lucky guess. This being so, such justification
could not possibly turn out to be a property that a belief might
possess in complete independence of the truth of its object. (Sosa
1985: 13)</p>

<p>
One is justified in believing that <em>p</em> only if that belief was
formed in such a way as to make it at least very likely that the
belief is true &hellip; or &hellip; in a &lsquo;truth-conducive&rsquo;
way. (Alston 1988b: 285)</p>

<p>
If epistemic justification were not conducive to truth &hellip; if
finding epistemically justified beliefs did not substantially increase
the likelihood of finding true ones, then epistemic justification
would be irrelevant to our main cognitive goal and of dubious worth.
(BonJour 1985: 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We might appeal to these observations to try to motivate externalism.
A kind of objective connection between belief and truth (e.g., that
the objective probability of a belief being true given the presence of
justification-conferring factors is greater than it would be in their
absence) is either necessary for justification to have value or
required for justification to play its designated role in turning true
belief into knowledge. We might think of these as the evaluative and
epistemicising arguments respectively.</p>

<p>
The evaluative argument assumes that justification is always valuable
from the epistemic point of view and that its value is due to its
truth-conducivity. The idea that the value of justification is
variable (i.e., that some but only some justified beliefs are
epistemically valuable) might be difficult for some epistemologists to
countenance, but perhaps there are reasonable grounds for doubting
that the value that justification always has derives from its
(alleged) truth-conducivity. Some of the intuitions from discussions
of the swamping problem might matter here (Zagzebski 1996; 2004).
Suppose true belief is inherently epistemically good. Is it plausible
that true beliefs are epistemically better if they are also justified
if being justified is just understood in terms of truth-conducivity?
It might seem that the epistemic value of a true belief is not
increased just because the means by which it was formed were reliable.
(This point, of course, is not wholly uncontroversial (Pettigrew 2019;
Dutant 2013).) It might also seem that if the value of justification
derived from truth-conducivity, its presence in the case of false
belief might &lsquo;turn out&rsquo; to add nothing of value to the
belief in question. (If the value of justification derives from the
fact that it is conducive to something further that is desirable, does
it retain its value when we know that this further thing does not
obtain?) It might be said that justification is always of epistemic
value because it is inherently valuable, but if we adopt a pluralism
about epistemic value (DePaul 2001; Kvanvig 2005), truth-conducivity
might play little role in explaining why the value justification has
is realised. It might also be thought that the best account of
justification&rsquo;s (alleged) inherent value derives not from
truth-conducivity but from the normative character of justification.
There might be some sense in which it is better to do one&rsquo;s duty
or fulfil one&rsquo;s obligation than not, but the sense in which this
is true might itself be understood in normative terms (i.e., the sense
in which it is better is precisely that a duty was fulfilled) instead
of evaluative terms (Foot 1985).</p>

<p>
Looming over this discussion is the new evil demon problem. Some would
argue that the evaluative argument fails on the grounds that we know
already that justification is only contingently connected to
truth-conducivity (Madison 2017). Some might cite intuitions about
cases of error and deception to try to turn the tables on the
externalists by arguing that some internalist alternative provides a
better understanding of the connection between justification and
truth. This might be done in terms of some notion of evidential fit
(Conee and Feldman 2004), an internalist-friendly notion of epistemic
probability (Fumerton 2004a), expected epistemic value (Dorst 2019;
Easwaran 2016; Dutant and Littlejohn 2024), or the responsible pursuit
of truth (Naylor 1988).</p>

<p>
The epistemicising argument for externalism about justification
appeals to claims about the role that justification plays in our
theory of the difference between knowledge and true beliefs that fail
to constitute knowledge. One challenge to this style of argument
emerges from reflection on Gettier cases (Cruz and Pollock 2004). A
standard response to Gettier&rsquo;s (1963) cases is to say that the
thinker has justification but not <em>warrant</em>. It is warrant
(rather than justification) that is supposed to eliminate the
accidental connection between the factors that justify and the truth
so that a true belief held with justification amounts to knowledge
(Zagzebski 1994).</p>

<h3 id="ExpCha">3.2 Explanatory Challenges</h3>

<p>
When Goldman proposed his reliabilist theory of justification, his aim
was to give an explanatory theory of justification, a theory that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; explains in a general way why certain beliefs are counted as
justified and others as unjustified &hellip; I do not try to prescribe
standards for justification that differ from, or improve upon, our
ordinary standards. (Goldman 1979: 89)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He offered a reliabilist theory that was meant to state the
truth-conditions for claims about justification in non-epistemic terms
much in the way that ethicists often try to state the necessary and
sufficient conditions for an act being right (Goldman 1979, 80). The
explanatory argument for externalism can be stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Explanatory Argument for Externalism</em></p>

<p>
P1. A theory of justification should explain why certain beliefs are
justified (or unjustified) according to our ordinary standards.</p>

<p>
P2. Externalist theories (e.g., reliabilism) better explain why the
beliefs that are justified (or unjustified) according to these
standards attain that status.</p>

<p>
C. So, we should prefer an externalist theory to its internalist
rivals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider some claims about justification that we might want our
theories to explain:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Storage:</strong> Much of what we know and justifiably believe
are things we continue to take to be true even though we have lost the
grounds that initially convinced us that these things are true.</p>

<p>
<strong>Starting Points:</strong> Small children learn quite a lot by
relying on the testimony of adults.</p>

<p>
<strong>Epistemic Poverty:</strong> A thinker who was brought up in an
isolated culture and believes unhesitatingly the traditions of their
group will not necessarily have justification to believe the things
they are told (e.g., about witchcraft, creation, the afterlife) even
though they might have no access to evidence that would correct their
erroneous beliefs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Generality:</strong> Not only do epistemic facts supervene
upon non-epistemic facts, there seem to be general principles that
connect non-epistemic facts to epistemic facts that identify important
patterns of dependence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For each of these claims, an externalist has argued that some
externalist view provides the best (or only) explanation.</p>

<p>
In connection with the knowledge and justified beliefs stored in
memory, we might find two closely related challenges to internalist
theories of the latter. First, there is the issue that much of what we
know and come to justifiably believe on the basis of evidence is
retained in memory. If our initial evidence for this belief is lost to
time and no new evidence is acquired, we can present this argument
against standard internalist views. The thinker knows now what she
learned earlier without now having evidence that supports her beliefs.
Thus, the thinker has justification to believe what she now believes
without supporting evidence (Pappas 1980; 1983). The best explanation
as to why this thinker now justifiably believes what she does will
appeal to external factors (e.g., the reliability of her memory and
facts about the adequacy of her evidence when she originally formed
her beliefs). To this, internalists might say that if justification is
understood in terms of responsibility, the internalist might say that
the relevant beliefs can be justified on the grounds that it is not
irresponsible to rely on memory in the absence of reasons to doubt its
reliability or accuracy (McGrath 2007). Alternatively, internalists
might say that we <em>do</em> have evidence now that supports these
beliefs in the form of the apparent memory (e.g., perhaps the truth of
the relevant belief is part of the best explanation as to why it now
seems we remember this) (Frise 2017).</p>

<p>
The second challenge arises for internalists who want to offer some
story that purports to explain how it is possible to have persisting
justification given the loss of original supporting evidence (Goldman
1999; Greco 1990). Suppose there are adequate internal factors that
explain how a thinker who learned initially that, say, broccoli is
good for heart health is justified <em>now</em> in believing this.
Whatever these factors are (e.g., the feelings of conviction that
accompany the belief, the impression that the thinker must have read
or heard this before), the internalist thinks these presently
obtaining internal factors (&lsquo;pi-factors&rsquo;) suffice for
justification. Imagine a second subject who came to believe the same
proposition but initially believed it for reasons that were inadequate
(e.g., they relied on a notoriously unreliable source when they formed
the belief but forgot their original grounds). This subject forms an
unjustified belief initially, but at this later time has a belief
accompanied by the same pi-factors as the subject who has a justified
belief. The second subject&rsquo;s belief at this later time is either
justified or not. If the internalist says that an unjustified belief
remains unjustified at this later time despite the fact that this
subject is now internally like the subject who has a justified belief,
the view might seem somewhat externalist since facts about the past
that do not supervene upon the pi-factors distinguish the justified
from the unjustified belief. If, however, the internalist says that
the pi-factors are sufficient to justify the beliefs of both subjects,
the internalist has to defend the controversial idea that a belief can
enjoy an epistemic upgrade, turning from unjustified initially to
justified later, by losing the grounds that initially supported the
belief.</p>

<p>
Internalists can respond to these challenges by trying to defend the
view that these subjects have adequate evidence presently that
justifies beliefs presently held (even if, perhaps, they lacked
adequate evidence initially) (Conee and Feldman 2004). They might also
question the insistence that the internal is limited to the present
(BonJour 2001; Fantl 2020). The force of the challenge will depend
upon whether losing information over time can improve the epistemic
status of our beliefs (Lackey 2005a; 2007; Senor 2007).</p>

<p>
Consider the problems presented by children. Observations about the
things that small children are purported to know loom large in debates
about testimonial knowledge and justification (Lackey 2005b). In this
setting, there is disagreement about whether attributing testimonial
knowledge to small children is a problem for reductionist views about
testimonial justification according to which testimonial justification
requires supporting evidence that the recipient of testimony can rely
on to confirm the reliability of the source or of this piece of
testimony (Fricker 1995; P. J. Graham 2018; Goldberg 2008).</p>

<p>
Internalists might respond by arguing that, properly understood,
children might meet the conditions imposed by their theories of
justification on the grounds that those requirements are relatively
lightweight (P. J. Graham 2018). Alternatively, internalists might
suggest that the beliefs of children can attain an important kind of
positive status that merits the label &lsquo;justified&rsquo; even if
it differs significantly from the kind of justification that attaches
to the beliefs of mature and responsible adults (Leite 2004) or that
there is a kind of &lsquo;sliding scale&rsquo; that can be used to
evaluate the beliefs of children and adults so that it is relatively
easy for children to acquire justification and knowledge given that
they cannot be expected to scrutinise reasons in the way that we can
(Smith 2002).</p>

<p>
There are more general problems associated with general epistemic
rules or principles. These principles identify conditions that
(defeasibly) confer justification upon our beliefs. Externalists and
internalists might generally agree that (in the absence of defeaters)
a belief can be justified if formed in response to experience, the
promptings of memory, introspection, proprioception, and so on. It
seems that some sources give us beliefs that are justified, some do
not, and one might hope there is a unifying explanation that explains
the difference between good and bad sources or grounds for belief.</p>

<p>
Following Goldman (1986), the externalist might suggest that a set of
rules (&lsquo;J-rules&rsquo;) identifies features that can help confer
justification upon our beliefs and that beliefs are justified when
permitted by the right system of J-rules. If the factors cited by such
rules are internal factors (e.g., we specify them with reference to
experience, apparent memory, etc.), this set-up might seem to favour
the internalist, but Goldman notes that there is a question about the
criteria of rightness that ultimately determines which (putative)
J-rules belong to this system. His proposed criterion of rightness
fits with the reliabilist vision in that conforming to the genuine
J-rules results in a sufficiently good ratio of true to false beliefs.
Structurally, this is similar to a rule-consequentialist picture in
ethics where acts are evaluated in light of rules which, in turn, are
seen as conferring positive status upon acts because conforming to
them promotes something of value (Hooker 2000). Even if the rules
mentioned only internal factors, the view of justification would be
externalist because external conditions ultimately determine which
J-rules belong to the system that confers justification.</p>

<p>
The explanatory argument for externalism appeals to two key ideas. The
first is that some externalist theories (e.g., reliabilism) can
explain why some collection of J-rules have that status (i.e., being
the rules that determine which beliefs are justified) when alternative
descriptions of belief-forming processes do not capture J-rules. The
second is that internalist theories do not have the resources to
explain this. Other things equal, we might prefer explanatory theories
to theories that do not explain the relevant observations. Critics
might say that not all is equal, however. The reliabilist must
acknowledge that it is a contingent fact about the J-rules that
conforming to them is truth-conducive, but many internalists seem to
think that there is a necessary connection between, say, believing
with justification and believing the things that our experiences or
apparent memories indicate (Cohen 1984). Moreover, the internalist can
say that there is an explanation as to why the factors cited in the
J-rules confer justification when others do not, by arguing that there
is an apriori connection between believing in response to the presence
of such factors and pursuing epistemic goals in rational ways (Cruz
and Pollock 2004; Enoch and Schechter 2008; Kelley 2024; Wedgwood
1999).</p>

<h3 id="EpiNor">3.3 Epistemic Norms</h3>

<p>
Some externalists about justification argue for their view by
appealing to the idea that belief is governed by epistemic norms that
have external conditions in their application condition (Littlejohn
2012; Sutton 2007; Williamson 2007). Much in the way that there might
be a legal norm that says, <em>inter alia</em>, that a person should
not enter another person&rsquo;s home without the owner&rsquo;s
consent, there might be an epistemic norm that enjoins us not to
believe or assert falsehoods (McHugh 2012; Steglich-Petersen 2013;
Whiting 2013) or things that we do not know (Sutton 2007; Williamson
2000). These externalists maintain that the existence of such norms
supports externalism about justification:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Argument from Externalist Epistemic Norms</em></p>

<p>
P1. A thinker has justification to believe <em>p</em> only if she can
believe <em>p</em> without violating any epistemic norms.</p>

<p>
P2. Among the norms she must conform to are externalist norms (i.e.,
norms with external application conditions).</p>

<p>
C. Thus, among the conditions that can determine whether a thinker has
justification to believe <em>p</em> are external conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The proponents of this argument will need to defend the position that
justification requires norm conformity. If, say, there is a norm that
requires us to refrain from believing when the evidence is
insufficient, we conform to this norm iff we do in fact avoid
believing when the evidence is insufficient. It might seem that the
point of justification is that the justified response is one that
violates no norm. (Or, at any rate, if the norm states some <em>pro
tanto</em> &lsquo;ought&rsquo;, does not violate such a norm unless
some second norm requires it, as we find when a person&rsquo;s
decision to miss a meeting is justified thanks to the fact that they
needed to intervene in some emergency.) Additionally, they will need
to show that there are indeed norms that have application conditions
that are not internal.</p>

<p>
Critics of this kind of argument challenge both premises. While there
has been a considerable amount of work done to try to show that the
best explanation of a range of data about proper belief and warranted
assertion invokes a knowledge norm, many have argued that the norm
does not need to be formulated in such a way that it has an external
application condition. Consider the observation that we should not
assert or believe that the ticket we hold for a fair lottery has lost
(Nelkin 2000). We might explain this by noting that we cannot know
lottery propositions (e.g., because they do not satisfy a safety
(Williamson 2000) or sensitivity (Dretske 1971; Nozick 1981) condition
on knowledge). Whilst the knowledge norm is indeed an externalist norm
(e.g., among other things, brains in vats that are internally similar
to us will violate it if they believe the kinds of things that we know
to be true), some will say that a rational belief norm properly
formulated will also handle the case (e.g., Smithies (2012b)).</p>

<h3 id="MorLoaCas">3.4 Morally Loaded Cases</h3>

<p>
One final argument for externalism about justification appeals to
observations about &lsquo;morally loaded cases&rsquo;. The proponents
of this kind of argument offer it in the hopes of shoring up support
for the key assumptions in the argument from externalist epistemic
norms (i.e., that there are, in fact, externalist epistemic norms and
that a belief&rsquo;s being justified depends upon conforming to them)
(Littlejohn 2012; Williamson 2019). They think we can find support for
externalism about the justification of belief by thinking about the
ways in which external conditions might have a bearing on the
justification of action.</p>

<p>
In one version of the argument, the externalist alleges that
internalist theories of justification must allow that it is possible
for a thinker to have justification to believe morally abhorrent
things. Consider a simplified version of the phenomenal
conservative&rsquo;s view according to which we can have justification
to believe something if it seems true and there are no available
defeaters (Huemer 2007). On this view, it seems we cannot rule out the
possibility that a coherent Nazi, cannibal, terrorist, or abusive
partner has morally abhorrent beliefs that are, by the lights of this
internalist theory, justified (Littlejohn 2011; Srinivasan 2020b;
Williamson 2019). Once this is granted, the internalist then has to
say whether such agents could be required not to act on such beliefs.
Suppose the internalist agrees that the agent has justification to do
what she justifiably believes she must do (Gibbons 2009; Littlejohn
2012; Kiesewetter 2016; Way and Whiting 2016). At this point, it seems
the internalist&rsquo;s view must be mistaken since, by the lights of
the objector, the view implies that agents have justification to do
things that are abhorrent and so unjustifiable. If, however, the
internalist denies that an agent is justified in doing something when
she justifiably judges she must, she runs the risk of violating
(putative) norms that internalists appeal to in trying to motivate
their view if not the spirit of the internalist enterprise. For
example, Huemer (2006) is critical of internalist views that imply
that there can be normative differences between cases when there is
nothing about those cases that would seem different to the individuals
in such cases. If an agent is, say, required not to press a button but
is required to ring a bell when she justifiably believes that she is
required to do both, this seems to run afoul of his principle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Argument from Morally Loaded Cases</em></p>

<p>
P1. By the lights of the internalist, there is no principled reason
why an agent could not justifiably believe that they were required to
do things that were morally abhorrent.</p>

<p>
P2. If someone justifiably believes they are required to do something,
they cannot be required to do otherwise.</p>

<p>
C. So, the internalist must admit that there is no principled reason
why the agent could not be justified in doing morally abhorrent
things.</p>

<p>
P3. However, by hypothesis, these things are abhorrent and so cannot
be justified.</p>

<p>
C2. So, the internalist theory must be mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Besides accepting externalism, what can be said in response to this
argument? First, some authors have suggested that there might be
actions that are, in some sense, morally evil or abhorrent even if it
is wrong to say that an agent ought not perform them (Zimmerman 2008).
Second, some might argue that if we allow for dilemmas of a certain
kind, the internalist might say that the relevant agents might be
required to act on beliefs and do things we regard as abhorrent
<em>and</em> required not to act on such beliefs. (For a sympathetic
discussion of epistemic dilemmas, see Hughes 2019.) Third, the
internalist might say that the bridge principles needed to connect the
justification of action to the justification of beliefs that guide
action are mistaken and should be rejected (Field 2019). Fourth,
internalists might try to show that (P1) is false and that there are
internalist theories of justification according to which we could
never have justification to believe the problematic propositions that
get the problem started. In a related context, some have suggested
that when bridge principles akin to (P2) hold, this is because a
thinker&rsquo;s evidence must always provide support for certain
principles that an ideal thinker could know <em>a priori</em> much in
the way that every body of evidence, according to the Bayesian,
provides maximal support for certain logical truths (Titelbaum 2015;
Wedgwood 2019).</p>

<h2 id="ConJus">4. Conceptions of Justification</h2>

<p>
One obstacle to resolving the disagreements between internalists and
externalists stems from an apparent lack of agreement on what
justification&rsquo;s theoretical role might be. To make progress,
epistemologists might try to identify some neutral characterisation of
the notion of justification and evaluate the arguments that purport to
tell us whether it would be possible for internalist or externalist
notions to play this role, or pick specific theoretical roles that
justification might play and try to determine whether an internal or
external condition is best suited to play that specific role.</p>

<p>
First, it is often said that justification plays some role in
transforming true belief into knowledge or distinguishing knowledge
from (mere) true belief (Conee and Feldman 2004). Does this conception
of justification favour internalism or externalism? While it is
generally agreed that the conditions that distinguish knowledge from
(mere) true belief include some external conditions (Zagzebski 1994),
it is unlikely this approach will advance the debate. The main
difficulty is that most epistemologists agree that if we define
&lsquo;warrant&rsquo; as the thing that distinguishes (mere) true
belief from knowledge (Plantinga 1993), justification is not the same
thing as warrant. This is evidenced by a common reaction to cases
drawn from or inspired by Gettier&rsquo;s (1963) discussion. Consider
a Gettier-type case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Fake Barn:</strong> While driving through the country, Henry
sees all the sorts of things one might expect to see on such a drive
(e.g., tractors, farm animals) and now sees a barn in good viewing
conditions. In this area, most of the apparent barns are really just
carefully constructed barn fa&ccedil;ades, but he happens to be
looking at the one genuine barn in the area. (Goldman 1976)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A standard response is to say that Henry does not know that this is a
barn even if he forms the true belief that it is one. As such, his
belief would not be warranted. Nevertheless, many think that Henry is
justified in his beliefs. Thus, it seems there is a kind of
justification that is not sufficient for warrant and so the fact that
warrant involves external conditions is no reason to think that this
notion of justification does, too.</p>

<p>
If cases like Fake Barn make it intuitively plausible that a kind of
justification is distinct from warrant, might we find support for
internalism about justification? It might seem that there is a kind of
epistemic luck (e.g., so-called &lsquo;environmental&rsquo; luck
(Engel 1992a; Pritchard 2012)) that threatens warrant but not
justification. A possible explanation for a difference in this kind of
liability might be that warrant depends upon external conditions
whereas the relevant kind of justification does not.</p>

<p>
A second approach might be to characterise justification as a property
that a belief potentially has when there is an available reason,
ground, or process that secures the right connection to something
epistemically desirable like truth. Externalists might suggest this
understanding of justification supports their preferred approach. They
might think, for example, that the right connection between
justification and truth must eliminate accidental connections between
belief and truth so that a justified belief is somehow better from the
epistemic point of view than a lucky guess (Sosa 1985). Internalists
might say, in keeping with the points above, that the kind of
justification they want to characterize is one that shows that
justified beliefs differ from lucky guesses in only certain respects.
For example, some epistemologists with sympathy for internalist
approaches think that a belief has the property of being justified
when it has properties that can be cited in a process of responding to
a challenge (Audi 1988b). If addressing such challenges is a matter of
showing that a thinker is not at fault or does not deserve criticism,
it might seem that the conditions that matter to justification are all
internal given the assumption that thinkers that are perfectly alike
internally are equally faultless in believing what they do (Audi
2001). Externalists might be unmoved by this line of argument because
they reject the idea that internally similar thinkers are always
equally faultless (Greco 2005) or because they reject the idea that
justification should be understood in terms of faultlessness (Goldman
1988; Littlejohn 2012; Wedgwood 2002).</p>

<p>
Third, we have seen that justification has been understood in terms of
(or linked to) rationality, responsibility, and propriety. The
connections between these overtly normative conceptions and other
conceptions (e.g., that which distinguishes between knowledge and some
true beliefs that fail to constitute knowledge) is unclear as it is
arguably the case that there can be propositional knowledge even when
a subject does not display a high degree of rationality, or an
impressive measure of responsibility, or perhaps should not hold the
belief in question (Engel 1992a; Pritchard 2012). The connections
between rationality, responsibility, and propriety themselves are
contested.</p>

<p>
Fourth, justification has been said to play a role in
&lsquo;traditional&rsquo; epistemological projects. Externalist
theories have been criticised for failing to offer theories of
justification that, <em>inter alia</em>, provide a philosophically
satisfying response to sceptical challenges or give us a
philosophically rich explanation of how it is that we can have
knowledge in some general domain (Fumerton 1995; 2004b; Stroud 2002).
Some early critics seemed to agree that the notions that answered to
some of the ideas above (e.g., the transformative conception according
to which justification helps turn true beliefs into knowledge, or the
idea that a justification requires the presence of a truth-conducive
ground or process) could be understood along externalist lines, so
this criticism suggests that epistemologists on different sides of the
internalism-externalism debate might be working with very different
conceptions of what justification is supposed to be.</p>

<p>
The apparent failure to find a suitably neutral characterisation of
justification might warrant scepticism about finding a substantive
resolution of the internalism-externalism debate. It has driven some
prominent epistemologists to say that it is &ldquo;thoroughly
misguided&rdquo; to think that &lsquo;justified&rsquo; singles out an
important objective feature of belief (Alston 2005: 11).
Epistemologists who think that we can have substantive disagreements
about justification might devise strategies for dealing with the
plurality of the different conceptions of justification discussed in
the literature.</p>

<p>
One way to implement this idea is to focus on the link between
justification and &lsquo;ought&rsquo; and the possibility that
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; might be read in different ways. Suppose a thinker
has justification to believe <em>p</em> when it is not the case that
the thinker should not believe <em>p</em> (Beddor 2017). If
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; can be read subjectively (e.g., what is best in
terms of expected value) and objectively (e.g., what is best in light
of all of the facts), a distinction between subjective and objective
justification might be introduced. Externalist theories could be seen
as theories of the attitudes a thinker objectively ought to have and
internalist theories could be seen as theories of the attitudes a
thinker subjectively ought to have. Conflicting responses to thought
experiments like the new evil demon thought experiment could be seen
as tracking these different notions of justification. Should a thinker
believe the falsehoods that appear true thanks to the interventions of
a powerful deceiver? Objectively speaking, no. Subjectively speaking,
perhaps they should, depending upon the details of the case.</p>

<p>
The proposal to recognise different notions of justification where
some fit better the theories of externalists and some the theories of
internalists might be attractive to (so-called) &lsquo;dividers&rsquo;
but not to &lsquo;debaters&rsquo; (Sepielli 2018). Dividers recognise
different ways of understanding talk of normatively significant
notions (e.g., that there are objective and subjective reasons,
objective or subjective readings of &lsquo;ought&rsquo;, objective and
subjective notions of justification, etc.), allowing that the claim
that an individual &lsquo;ought&rsquo; to believe or act might be
acceptable on one reading (e.g., one that ranks options in terms of
the agent&rsquo;s information) but not on other admissible readings
(e.g., one that ranks options in terms of all the facts) (Carr 2015).
Debaters either think there is only one significant notion to
understand (e.g., they might think that the only reading of
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; that captures something of normative significance
focuses on an individual&rsquo;s evidence) or they propose that one
such notion is of primary importance (e.g., that the reading of
primary importance is an objective one that is potentially sensitive
to all the facts even if there are derivative readings that focus just
on things like the thinker&rsquo;s evidence). Some resist the
debater&rsquo;s intervention on the grounds that there is only one
reading of the &lsquo;ought&rsquo; that matters to epistemology (e.g.,
some have argued that, &lsquo;We ought to fit our beliefs to the
evidence&rsquo; is true when we read this as pertaining to an
epistemic reading of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; and there is no reading of
this that uses an epistemic reading of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; on which it
is false) (Feldman 1988). There is also widespread scepticism about
the idea that &lsquo;ought&rsquo; can be read objectively and
subjectively (Gibbons 2013; P. A. Graham 2021; Thomson 2003; Zimmerman
2008) as well as scepticism about the idea that on an objective
reading, &lsquo;ought&rsquo; has anything to do with our concept of
justification (Huemer forthcoming). There is also the worry that this
kind of pluralism undermines the idea that there is a substantive
disagreement or debate to be had between the internalists and
externalists (Chalmers 2011; Jenkins 2014; Kopec 2018).</p>

<p>
To someone convinced that there is a plurality of notions with no
interesting connection between them, it might seem that pursuing the
debates further is fruitless and that energies might be better
directed at different questions (Alston 2005). Some debaters adopt
that view because they reject the idea that there are non-defective
and normatively significant readings of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; that
abstract away from the perspectives of rational thinkers (Gibbons
2010; Mu&ntilde;oz and Spencer 2021; Zimmerman 2008). A divider might
see some disagreements between debaters as substantive since the
disagreements are, <em>inter alia</em>, disagreements about whether
such a reading of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; picks out anything of normative
significance. Such dividers might recognise, for example, that
internalist norms capture something of normative significance while
insisting that there are further externalist norms (Littlejohn 2024;
Whiting 2022). The character of these externalist norms might explain
why the norms that internalist theories posit focus on certain kinds
of conditions: e.g., the hypothesis that belief is governed by a
knowledge-norm is used to explain why rational thinkers do not believe
outright lottery propositions (Sutton 2007; Williamson 2000), or why
rational thinkers believe outright in some preface-type cases but not
in lottery cases (Dutant and Littlejohn 2024), or why it is not
rational to believe Moorean &lsquo;absurdities&rsquo; such as
&lsquo;Dogs bark, but I don&rsquo;t know if they do&rsquo; (Huemer
2000).</p>
