<p>
The phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is generally understood by
American lawyers and judges as referring to various
&ldquo;nondiscrimination rights&rdquo; created by the federal
&ldquo;Civil Rights Acts&rdquo; of the 1960s through the 1990s. Those
rights, themselves the product of the civil rights movement of the
1960s, aim to protect all Americans against adverse and discriminatory
actions that might otherwise be taken against them on the basis of
race, sex, religion, ethnicity, disability, and age in various spheres
of social life, including employment, housing, banking and credit,
public accommodations, education, and voting. These antidiscrimination
rights were and are intended to end the practice, common during the
Jim Crow era, of bestowing employment, educational, credit and housing
opportunities and benefits unequally between members of different
racial, sexual and religious groups, as well as disabled and older
individuals.</p>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; however has sometimes referred
to a very different set of rights, both historically and globally, and
also means something considerably broader in contemporary usage as
well. In English Common Law, the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
sometimes simply referred to those rights, possessed by citizens, that
are the products of positive law, contrasting with &ldquo;natural
rights,&rdquo; or &ldquo;human rights,&rdquo; which attach by virtue
of one&rsquo;s humanity. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the
Reconstruction-era Congress in the United States passed the 1866
&ldquo;Civil Rights Act,&rdquo; which mandated that &ldquo;civil
rights,&rdquo; understood in this generally legalistic way, must be
extended equally to all, Blacks as well as whites, &ldquo;regardless
of prior condition of servitude.&rdquo; Thus the Civil Rights Act of
1866 aimed to ensure that Blacks as well as whites should equally
enjoy the protections of the civil law.</p>

<p>
Since the passage of that Act, the phrase &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo;
both in the United States and globally has most often been understood
as referring to those laws and the rights they create which in some
way aim for equality, rather than, as in earlier times, those rights
created by all bodies of positive law. In contemporary usage, the
phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is broader still. In addition to
antidiscrimination rights, and rights to the equal protection of laws,
rights against police brutality and other unconstitutional actions
taken by state officials are also now widely regarded as civil rights.
More aspirationally, various movements for the enactment of new law
that might create rights that don&rsquo;t currently exist, but that
would broadly protect human welfare, such as rights to social welfare,
a clean environment, to privacy, or to safety against gun violence are
sometimes understood as aiming for &ldquo;civil rights.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
There is little consensus and a dearth of scholarship&mdash;and even
less actual law&mdash;on the meaning of the evocative and
inspirational phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;. In antiquity,
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; meant something like the rights of
individuals created by private or civil law, and which attach by
virtue of one&rsquo;s citizenship in a polity (Justinian,
<em>Institutes</em>). They included rights to marry, paternal rights
over family members, rights to leave a will, rights to own, buy and
sell property, and rights to contract. The possession of &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo;&mdash;rights defined by civil or private law&mdash;was
part of what distinguished &ldquo;citizens&rdquo;, who had them, from
&ldquo;slaves&rdquo;, who did not, as well as from &ldquo;free
people&rdquo;, including all women and children, who might be under
guardianship or in some other way incapacitated, and who accordingly
lacked all or some civil rights, but were also not slaves. More
recently, but still several centuries back, &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
in English law were broadly understood to be those legal rights
derived from the common law, such as the law of contract and property,
that governed private life. In his authoritative <em>Commentaries on
the Laws of England</em>, Sir William Blackstone contrasted
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, derived from the common law, with
&ldquo;natural liberties&rdquo;, or &ldquo;natural freedoms&rdquo;,
which attach by virtue of human nature or God&rsquo;s will, some of
which are given up upon entering civil society, in exchange for civil
rights. He drew a second contrast as well: a &ldquo;private
wrong&rdquo; was a violation of a &ldquo;civil right&rdquo;, involving
disputes between individuals, and would lead, possibly, to a private
lawsuit, in contrast to a &ldquo;public wrong&rdquo;, which was a
crime against the sovereign and would lead to prosecution (Blackstone
1765&ndash;1769). In the eighteenth and the first half of the
nineteenth century, &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, at least in the United
States, apparently meant something like a subset of all those common
law rights governing private life, but which are also in some
meaningful sense &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;. They included not only
property and contract rights, but also rights to be free of privately
inflicted injuries, rights of access to the courts for compensation
when those rights were breached, rights to give testimony in courts,
the right to marry, and the right to write and leave an enforceable
will. That usage of the phrase informed the passage of the first
generation of &ldquo;Civil Rights Acts&rdquo; enacted in the US in the
aftermath of the Civil War, which sought to guarantee that those same
legal, or, again, &ldquo;civil&rdquo; rights would be enjoyed by
freedmen, as well as whites (Rutherglen 2012; Barnett &amp; Bernick
2019, 2021). These historical usages&mdash;all of which in some way
identify civil rights with existing legal rights that govern private
life, and that one enjoys or should enjoy by virtue of one&rsquo;s
citizenship in a polity, have for the most part&mdash;although not
entirely&mdash;lapsed. And no clear definition emerged in any of these
historical periods. They are not defined in Justinian&rsquo;s
Institutes, nor in Blackstone&rsquo;s <em>Commentaries</em>, nor in
the 1866 Civil Rights Acts. Rather, in each period the jurists and
legislators that used the phrase apparently assumed the existence of a
shared understanding.</p>

<p>
Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, with the
passage in the US of the 1866 and 1870 civil rights acts, through the
first two decades of the twenty-first, a very different set of usages
of the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; emerged, most vividly in the
United States but in a number of other countries as well. There are
some commonalities and continuities between contemporary meanings and
older usages. As in the older Roman Law and English Common Law
traditions, the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, throughout this
&ldquo;long century&rdquo;&mdash;the second half of the nineteenth
century to the early decades of the twenty-first&mdash;has typically
referred to a particular subset of legal rights and the body of law
those rights entail&mdash;or, sometimes, to a demand that such a body
of law be created. Echoing the classical definitions, contemporary
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, like all legal rights&mdash;and
<em>unlike</em> &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; &ldquo;moral rights&rdquo;
or &ldquo;natural rights&rdquo;&mdash;are understood as creations of
positive law (see the entry on Human Rights). Thus, the phrase
&ldquo;civil rights law&rdquo;, now as in earlier eras, refers to the
body of domestic positive law that creates various civil rights and
the source of remedies for their enforcement when breached.
But&mdash;and here is the definitive break with both the usage of the
phrase in antiquity and the usage that makes an appearance in
Blackstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commentaries on the Laws of
England&rdquo;&mdash;the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; no longer
refers to those legal rights derived either from the common law or
from a European-styled Civil Code which govern private life, the
possession of which partly defines citizenship. Rather&mdash;civil
rights are now widely understood to be those legal rights that <em>aim
for equality</em>, in private and public life both, and which attach
to, or are for the benefit of, groups heretofore profoundly unequal by
virtue of either &ldquo;their prior condition of servitude&rdquo;,
their political subordination, their historical or ongoing exclusions
from the benefits of citizenship, or from social stigma or widespread
abuse (Zietlow 2009; Ackerman 2014). In contrast to natural, human or
moral rights, civil rights, in common with all legal rights, are
creations of law. But in contrast to other legal rights, the goal of
the rights themselves and the &ldquo;civil rights laws&rdquo; that
create them is not to &ldquo;give each man his due&rdquo;, or to
ensure public or private order, or a modicum of civil peace and
justice. And, in contrast to some (not all) constitutional
rights&mdash;such as those outlined in the US Bill of Rights&mdash;as
well as to what are widely called &ldquo;civil liberties&rdquo;, the
goal of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is not to protect a sphere of
individual life within which a state or its government may not
intrude. Civil rights, unlike constitutional rights and unlike civil
liberties, are not typically &ldquo;negative rights&rdquo; or rights
of liberty against an overly intrusive state. The goal of both the
civil rights themselves and the &ldquo;civil rights laws&rdquo; that
enforce them is the political equality and the social inclusion of
particular groups and their members who without them would suffer
massive and ongoing inequalities, creating severe and systematic
injustice (Zietlow 2005; West 2011, 2019).</p>

<p>
Assuming that equality is the implied or explicit goal of civil rights
law, what, though, does equality require? What is the conception of
equality which civil rights guarantee, or aim to guarantee? What does
the imperative of equality require of law, and how can that equality
be guaranteed by, or delivered by, &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;? Again,
there is remarkably little scholarship that centers these questions,
and virtually no law that does so. There are, however, a remarkably
high number of civil rights <em>laws,</em> from which one can infer
tentative answers. Most European countries, the EU itself,
International Law, some Latin American countries, Ireland, Israel,
South Africa, the United Kingdom, Indonesia and many others, have
various bodies of law that aim to guarantee the &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; of various groups along with civil liberties and
fundamental human
 rights.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 And civil rights laws, alongside of and sometimes in tension with
constitutional rights, have played and continue to play an outsized
role in US law and legal culture. From these civil rights laws that
are &ldquo;on the books&rdquo;, so to speak, it is possible to
generate some overriding principles, or understandings, of both the
meaning of the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; generally and the
nature of the equality they demand of law. This entry will attempt to
do so.</p>

<p>
It is clearly not possible, however, to catalog those laws worldwide,
with their distinctive and distinguishing national legal histories.
Rather, this entry will focus on US civil rights laws as a significant
exemplar and will draw from those laws a range of meanings, or
conceptions, of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;. The competing conceptions
of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and the civil rights that are aimed to
achieve it that can be discerned from US civil rights law overlap
substantially with&mdash;but are not identical to&mdash;conceptions of
civil rights that are reflected in the law of other countries, where
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is more often understood as a part of a
larger commitment to &ldquo;human rights law&rdquo;. Nevertheless
there is substantial overlap, particularly in countries which, like
the US, have had histories of subordinated, excluded or previously
enslaved groups and a distinctive body of civil rights law that has
sought their inclusion and equality.</p>

<p>
This entry accordingly delineates three distinguishable principles of
equality that have informed some part of the US civil rights
tradition, as reflected in US civil rights laws themselves. The first,
earliest, and perhaps the most basic is what might be called the
&ldquo;equal protection principle&rdquo;. According to this principle,
civil rights, as per Blackstone and Justinian both, are indeed legal
rights that pertain to private life, which are derived from either
common or civil law. What <em>equality</em> demands, however, is that
the protections of those laws be enjoyed by all equally. Thus,
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; are not simply the private law-generated
rights themselves, but rather, are basically rights to the
&ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; of the particular fields of law in
which those rights originate, or to the equal benefit which the
protection accorded those laws might bestow. This is the conception of
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; ultimately reflected in the Civil Rights
Acts of 1866 and the Enforcement Acts from the decade that followed
(Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1870, 1871 and 1875). This understanding
of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;equal protection of
laws&rdquo; as the essence of the equality which civil rights aim to
ensure, however, has also largely disappeared from US jurisprudence,
in part because the Equal Protection Clause of Section One and the
enforcement provision of Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment of
the
 Constitution<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>&mdash;passed
 in part to ensure that Congress had the authority to pass the 1866
Act&mdash;have themselves come to mean something very different in
twentieth century jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the equal protection
principle still echoes, albeit as a minor theme, in contemporary US
civil rights law and in constitutional law both.</p>

<p>
The second understanding of the meaning of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;,
and of the equality at their core, is what is now widely called the
&ldquo;Antidiscrimination Principle&rdquo; (Brest 1976; Hellman 2008).
This is the dominant understanding of civil rights in the US today, as
well as in a number of countries with histories of apartheid, caste,
or differential treatment of minority groups. Civil rights, on this
understanding, are rights of individuals to be free of discriminatory
treatment on the basis of an individual&rsquo;s membership in a group
which has itself been the target of political subordination, legally
sanctioned segregation, or societal ill treatment. The civil right of
nondiscrimination extends a right to be free of such treatment by
government actors, by laws themselves, and in some circumstances by
private parties. Thus, every individual has a civil right not to be
treated differently or worse on the basis of membership in a group
defined by race, sex, ethnicity, religion or other
characteristics&mdash;such as advanced age or
disability&mdash;associated with a history of exclusion or abuse.
Civil rights are basically rights against that discriminatory
treatment. The antidiscrimination model has dominated US civil rights
law, and civil rights consciousness, from the middle of the twentieth
century to the present. The body of civil rights law that has emerged
around this organizing principle&mdash;antidiscrimination&mdash;is,
however, badly conflicted, and has been the target of waves of
criticism from scholars, courts and activists, and from across the
political spectrum. Those criticisms have taken a toll, and the
discrimination principle, though still dominant, may be fading.</p>

<p>
The third conception of civil rights and the equality at which it
aims, both in the US and globally, that may be now emergent, and may
over time be displacing both the equal protection and the
antidiscrimination principles, is premised on what might be called a
&ldquo;welfarist principle&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; increasingly points to those legal rights which we
either have, or which we ought to have, in order to have equal
opportunities to flourish, both in our communities and our individual
lives. &ldquo;Civil rights&rdquo; may today be best understood as
referring to rights to the laws we have or should have that aim to
ensure the social conditions for doing so. We all have an equal right
to have the opportunity to flourish, and what that might imply is a
civil right to a state that, through law, establishes the conditions
that make that possible. Welfarist understandings of &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; are very different from both equal protection and
antidiscrimination conceptions, and more resonant with the reach,
universality, and ambition of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; in the rest
of the world. Each is discussed separately in the three sections
below.</p>

<h2 id="CivRigRigEquProLaw">2. Civil Rights as Rights to the Equal Protections of Laws</h2>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, to most twentieth and twenty
first century American lawyers, refers to the
&ldquo;antidiscrimination rights&rdquo; created by the 1960s civil
rights acts&mdash;rights to not be discriminated against on the basis
of impermissible characteristics in the worlds of work, school,
housing, commerce, finance, voting, and public life.
 <a href="#CivRigAntRig">Section 3</a>
 of this entry will focus on this understanding, and the major
criticisms that have been lodged against it. It is important to
understand, however, that the phrase meant something quite different,
and captured a very different set of aspirations, in the nineteenth
century, culminating in the momentous and pivotal post-bellum Civil
Rights Act of 1866. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, all
southern states, joined by a number of northern states, passed
&ldquo;Black Codes&rdquo; that among much else explicitly denied freed
slaves the protections of a wide range of ordinary legal rights, such
as the enforcement of their contracts, protection of their property
through legal mechanisms, the capacity to sue in court for damages
caused by tortious conduct of others, the ability to give testimony,
and the power to leave a will and expect it to be enforced (Foner
1988: 199&ndash;210). The Codes created a large number of crimes, such
as vagrancy crimes, that basically criminalized the status of being
unemployed, imposed harsh sentences, and stipulated that any white
person could arrest any freedman for violations. And, although not an
explicit part of the Black Codes, the states also blatantly denied the
freedmen the routine and ordinary protection of police forces against
the waves of violence directed at them by &ldquo;white patrols&rdquo;,
police themselves, and the nascent Ku Klux Klan.</p>

<p>
Abolitionist republicans in Congress viewed the Black Codes, in
conjunction with the unpoliced white violence against Blacks that
accompanied those laws, as the functional return of slavery in all but
name (Foner 1988: 251&ndash;281; Rutherglen 2012, 1&ndash;19).
Congress eventually responded with passage of the 1866 Civil Rights
Act&mdash;marking the first time the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
entered the legal, legislative canon. The Act purported to grant all
freedmen an equal right to the protection of &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo;, regardless of &ldquo;prior condition of
servitude&rdquo; to the same degree as that enjoyed by white men.
(Thus, an early example of what Hannah Arendt would later call a
&ldquo;Right to have Rights&rdquo;.) The Civil Rights Act thus
ensured, or sought to ensure, that freed slaves would have <em>equal
protection</em> of these bodies of law, and hence these legal rights,
as well as access to the Courts to protect them. The Fourteenth
Amendment, and particularly its &ldquo;Equal Protection of the
Laws&rdquo; clause in Section One and its enabling clause in Section
Five, was passed a few months later to ensure that Congress would be
understood to have the constitutional authority to enact just such
laws.</p>

<p>
But what <em>were</em> the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; the freedmen
were guaranteed, under the 1866 Civil Rights Act? Again, just to
stress, no definition appears in the Act. On the one hand, the rights
<em>created</em> by the 1866 Act itself were &ldquo;antidiscrimination
rights&rdquo; in something like the sense that came to be familiar in
the twentieth century: all citizens, regardless of prior condition of
slavery or servitude, were to enjoy the same &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; as white men. The Act thus <em>created</em> a right of
equality: a right to the equal enjoyment of civil rights. The
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; themselves, however, which the Civil Rights
Act first listed, and then guaranteed would be granted and granted
equally to whites and freedmen alike, were decidedly <em>not</em>
antidiscrimination rights or even equality rights. They were, rather,
those Blackstonian legal rights that had long been granted white men,
generally by the common law, including, prominently, rights to make
and enforce contracts, to write wills, to have one&rsquo;s property
rights respected and enforced, to testify in Court, and, perhaps most
significantly, to &ldquo;enjoy the benefit of those laws meant for the
protection of one&rsquo;s physical and material security&rdquo;. The
first section of the Act reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[S]uch citizens, of every race and color, without regard to any
previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude &hellip; shall
have the same right, in every State and Territory in the United
States, <em>to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and
give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real
and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and
proceedings for the security of person&hellip; and property</em>, as
is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like
punishment&hellip;. And to none other, any law&hellip;. to the
contrary notwithstanding. (Civil Rights Act 1866, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Act raises a host of questions. First, why were <em>these</em>
legal rights&mdash;rights to make and enforce contracts, to own,
inherit, sell, hold and convey property, have access to the courts,
and rights to the laws that would provide protection of one&rsquo;s
material and physical wellbeing&mdash;singled out? Why were these
rights in particular the enumerated &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, which
must be guaranteed to all equally, rather than some other set of legal
rights? Briefly, as gleaned from its history, the class of
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; so recognized were those legal
rights&mdash;rights created by law&mdash;that were deemed most
fundamental to thriving, prospering, or surviving in civil society. In
both pre- and post-bellum America, that included rights, such as
property and contract rights, that would facilitate entry into and
participation in the economy (Barnett &amp; Bernick 2019, 2021). It
also included rights to the protections of law against theft and
criminal assault, and it included rights to sue and to give testimony
in Court, so as to make the underlying rights meaningful.</p>

<p>
But second, what general conception of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
underlies this particular list of legal rights, on which the framers
of the &ldquo;Civil Rights Act&rdquo; of 1866 relied, when they made
this momentous historical law? Where did it come from? Historians
differ on that question, in large part because the philosophical
distinctions drawn at the time between civil rights, political rights,
social rights, legal rights, and natural rights were not at all clear
and were drawn differently by different actors. According to one
prominent historian of the period, the framers likely relied on
familiar materials, including both Justinian&rsquo;s Institutes and
Blackstone&rsquo;s Commentaries (Rutherglen 2012, 41&ndash;46.
According to another, the framers viewed &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; as
tied in some way to &ldquo;natural rights&rdquo; (Tushnet 1992). A
third states that there simply was no conception of &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; in pre-bellum discourse the framers started, to so
speak, from the ground up (White 2014). All agree though that one
possible legal source for understanding the meaning of the phrase was
the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation of the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the original Constitution (Article IV, Section
 2),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 in a case entitled <em>Coryfield v Coryell</em>, in which Justice
Washington declared that the &ldquo;privileges and immunities of
citizenship&rdquo; are defined as those</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
which are in their nature fundamental; which belong, of right, to the
citizens of all free governments; and which have&hellip; been enjoyed
by the citizens of the several states which compose this Union from
the time of their becoming&hellip; sovereign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He then included</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
rights to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of
the state; to take, hold and dispose of property, either real or
personal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Justice Washington&rsquo;s definition, however, was not of
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; in that passage, but of the privileges and
immunities protection by Article IV. Legal definitions of civil
rights, at the time, were scant.</p>

<p>
A second possible source that might have influenced the 1866
Act&rsquo;s framers&rsquo; conception of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is
a passage from Thomas Paine&rsquo;s widely read <em>The Rights of
Man</em>, published three quarters of a century before the 1866 Act.
Paine distinguished &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; from &ldquo;natural
rights&rdquo;, and in language that is later echoed in some of the
pivotal language in the 1866 Act itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Natural rights are those [rights] which appertain to man in right of
his existence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights
of the mind and also all those rights of acting as an individual for
his own comfort and happiness, which are not injurious to the natural
rights of others. Civil rights are those which appertain to man in
right of his being a member of society. Every civil right has for its
foundation, some natural right pre-existing in the individual, but to
the enjoyment of which his individual power is not, in all cases,
sufficiently competent. Of this kind are all those which relate to
security and protection. (Paine 1791 [1995: 119&ndash;120])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paine&rsquo;s definition seems to both reflect the Blackstonian
conception of civil rights as legal rights, and to foreshadow the
limitation of &ldquo;privileges and immunities&rdquo; to those deemed
&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;, found in Justice Washington&rsquo;s
exposition in <em>Coryfield v Coryell</em>. Civil rights, to Paine,
were those rights &ldquo;founded in&rdquo; natural rights, but which
peculiarly appertain to man by virtue of his being a &ldquo;member of
society&rdquo; (rather than by virtue of his humanity)&mdash;thus,
they are legal rights, not themselves natural rights&mdash;and which
require, distinctively, both positive law and legal institutions for
their protection: &ldquo;his individual power is not&hellip;
sufficiently competent&rdquo; (Paine 1791). Putting these conditions
together yields an understanding of civil rights that seems close to
that embodied in the 1866 Act: civil rights are that subset of all
rights which a citizen possesses by virtue of his existence as a
&ldquo;member of society&rdquo;, but which are in some sense so
fundamental as to justify their characterization as being
&ldquo;founded in&rdquo;&mdash;although not being
themselves&mdash;natural rights, <em>and which</em> also require
<em>law</em> for their realization, because his individual power is
not &ldquo;sufficiently competent&rdquo;. Put more succinctly, they
are those rights which are &ldquo;founded&rdquo; in the subset of
natural rights that pertain to participation in society, but which
require positive law for their enjoyment. Both the logic and language
of this Painean account are echoed in the 1866 Act, which explicitly
references particular bodies of positive law as being the source of
the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; that must be equally bestowed, along
with &ldquo;all laws and proceedings for the security of person and
property&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase directly mirroring
Paine&rsquo;s&mdash;as central to the civil rights to be thereby
protected.</p>

<p>
Here, then, is one possible definition of the nineteenth century view
of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;, reading the 1866 Act against the
backdrop of Paine&rsquo;s distinctions, <em>Coryfield&rsquo;s</em>
emphasis on rights which are &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; and
Blackstone&rsquo;s (and Justinian&rsquo;s) baseline definitions.
First, both the content and the <em>justification</em> of the subset
of legal rights that should be regarded as &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
can be found in some subset of natural rights, or natural law. To this
degree, then, it makes sense to regard the nineteenth century
understanding of civil rights as tied in definitional ways to natural
rights, without themselves <em>being</em> natural rights. Rights to
contract, property, legal process and the protection of law against
violence were all so viewed; those legal rights are
&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; because they are the rights that facilitate
participation and inclusion in economic and civil life (Barnett &amp;
Bernick 2021). Thus, civil rights were not simply all legal rights
that might be read off of existing law, but nor were they simply
another name for natural rights. Rather, they were those legal rights
so fundamental as to be grounded in natural law, or natural rights,
which facilitate participation in civil life, <em>and which</em>,
distinctively, required positive law to perfect. By virtue of a civil
rights <em>law</em>&mdash;the 1866 Civil Rights Act&mdash;all freedmen
must be equally as entitled as white men to enjoy the protections of
those bodies of law.</p>

<p>
What happened to this &ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; conception of
civil rights and of the equality it aims to guarantee at its core? It
was undone, basically, over the course of the bloody decades that came
on the heels of Emancipation, and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
jurisprudence of that era. Congress had passed &ldquo;Enforcement
Acts&rdquo; in 1870 and 1871 that aimed to empower federal law
enforcement officers, federal judges and courts, and federal
prosecutors, to enforce the rights created by the 1866 Act. Those acts
were then used to prosecute crimes of violence as well as other
violations of the freedmen&rsquo;s newly won civil or constitutional
rights committed by white supremacists and white insurrectionists, and
to prosecute them for &ldquo;civil rights violations&rdquo; under the
1866, 1870, and 1871 Acts. Those prosecutions, however, were
challenged as unconstitutional, basically on the grounds that they
violated nascent principles of federalism, which vested the powers and
responsibilities of the enforcement of the common law, including laws
against criminal acts, with states, and not with the federal
government. The Supreme Court agreed, eventually holding that the
Enforcement Acts, if used to prosecute &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; that
were, at heart, derived from the common law, claimed too much
authority for the federal government, at the expense of the power and
right of states, to control and enforce that law. (<em>Cruikshank v
US</em>). Congress simply did not have the constitutional power to
take such intrusive action against state authority. It is up to the
states, not the federal government, to ensure that all of its citizens
enjoy the protections of state law, including the bodies of law
enumerated by the 1866 Act. The states may indeed have a duty&mdash;a
moral or natural duty&mdash;to ensure that all citizens enjoy the
protections of those bodies of law. The federal government, however,
has no role to play in ensuring that they do so.</p>

<p>
The 1866 Act, which again spelt out particular areas of the common law
and asserted that all citizens, regardless of prior condition of
servitude, were entitled to their protections, was never overtly
struck down. It was the <em>enforcement</em> of those rights by
federal officials&mdash;and as federal law&mdash;that was held to be
unconstitutional, so long as the enforcement sought took the form of
prosecutions of private individuals rather than public officials. The
meaning, however, of that momentous Act was radically reconceived. The
very broad and deep understanding of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; that
apparently motivated the 1866 law&mdash;that everyone is entitled to
the protections of some areas of ordinary but fundamental law because
that protection is necessary in order to thrive societally, that
particular fields of the common law can be identified as constituting
that fundamental law, and that the US Congress has the authority and
responsibility to guarantee those protections&mdash;has simply been
lost, and the understanding of the meaning of &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; at its heart has become archaic. The Supreme Court held
explicitly, in the decades following passage of the Acts, and
repeatedly, that neither the Equal Protection Clause, nor the
Privileges and Immunities Clause, nor the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment gives the federal government the authority to
protect the civil rights of individuals against the infringement of
those rights by private individuals, or by state governments in the
absence of impermissible racial distinctions (<em>Civil Rights
Cases</em> [1883], <em>Cruikshank v. United States</em> [1876],
<em>Slaughterhouse Case</em> [1873]). The <em>antidiscriminatory</em>
content of the 1866 law has been retained and was vastly expanded in
the Civil Rights Acts of the twentieth century as discussed below: if
an individual refuses to contract, sell a house, or employ someone
because of race, there is an actionable violation of a civil right
against that individual. The philosophical idea reflected in that Act,
however&mdash;that citizens all have civil rights to the protections
of various bodies of ordinary law that are so vital to membership in a
civil society that their protections must be extended to all&mdash;has
been almost entirely lost.</p>

<p>
One consequence of this is loosely political: we have lost an
understanding that we have fundamental civil rights, as opposed to
simple legal rights, to the particular rights enumerated in that
amendment: to the enforceability of our contracts, to the enjoyment of
our property, to &ldquo;our security and protection&rdquo; as Paine
put it, or to the &ldquo;full and equal benefit of all laws and
proceedings for the security of person&rdquo;, as stated in the Act
itself, as well as to our rights to participate in the legal processes
necessary to protect those civil rights. To be clear, we <em>do</em>
have antidiscrimination rights that guarantee that these rights (and
others) may not be denied on account of race. But we do not have civil
rights that go beyond antidiscrimination to the rights that derive
from the bodies of law themselves. Thus, if a state were to refuse to
enforce contracts entered into by Black citizens, while enforcing
contracts of white citizens, or if a state were to refuse to extend
the protections of the criminal law to Black crime victims but not
white victims, and did so because of provable racial animus, there may
be a violation of civil rights and of civil rights law, premised on
that unequal treatment. If instead, though, the state simply stopped
enforcing contracts across the board, or defunded the police force
completely and did so with no discriminatory intent, there would be no
actionable civil rights violation, no grounds for a lawsuit, and no
sense of alarm that a civil right to that very protection had been
violated, regardless of whether it could be remedied. There are a few
exceptions in the scholarly literature&mdash;although not in the law
itself&mdash;to this general neglect. Some constitutional originalists
now argue that the particular &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; listed in the
1866 Act&mdash;rights of contract and property&mdash;should have been
regarded in the nineteenth century and should still be regarded as
federal &ldquo;privileges and immunities&rdquo; under that now
generally moribund clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore
that Congress does indeed possess the authority&mdash;and even the
obligation&mdash;to both guarantee those property and contract rights,
and constitutionally protect them against legislative infringement
(Barnett &amp; Bernick (2021). If that is right, then Supreme Court
authority to the contrary is simply wrong. Justice Thomas has long
held the somewhat idiosyncratic view that Second Amendment rights of
gun ownership should also be regarded as a &ldquo;privilege and
immunity&rdquo; and therefore a &ldquo;civil right&rdquo; which
Congress might accordingly guarantee (J. Thomas, concurring opinion in
<em>McDonald v City of Chicago</em> [2010]). But aside from these
academic attempts, and Thomas&rsquo;s view expressed in
<em>McDonald</em>, there is no widespread sense&mdash;let alone a deep
conviction&mdash;that there is a pre-existing civil right to the
protection of either the bodies of ordinary law derived from the
common law&mdash;contract law, property law, tort law, or criminal
law&mdash;and listed in that Act, or any other body of ordinary law,
the protection of which should be granted and enjoyed by everyone and
protected as civil rights.</p>

<p>
A second consequence, however, is deeper, and more jurisprudential in
scope: We have lost a universalist understanding of the meaning of
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; implicit in the 1866 Act&rsquo;s
enumeration, that might be viable <em>whether or not</em> the
particular enumeration of laws contained in that Act&mdash;laws of
contract, property, access to courts, etc.&mdash;are still those most
fundamental to modern life. In other words, we&rsquo;ve lost the
general conception of civil rights, as well as the particular
conception of the constellation of rights enumerated in the Act that
qualify. We&rsquo;ve lost the sense that &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo;&mdash;whatever their particular content&mdash;are
generally those legal rights, derived from ordinary law, which are so
fundamental, or important, or central, or essential, to our lives as
citizens that we hold them as civil rights rather than merely as legal
rights. Which legal rights might fit this description, could, and
likely does, vary across large spans of time. The role once held by
contract law and property law, as essential to participation in
economic life, for example, might now be held by some other bodies of
law, such as, arguably, employment and education law. In the
twenty-first century, we might need education and employment, and
therefore education law and employment law, at least as much as we
need property law or contract rights, to fully engage in contemporary
civil life. If so, then perhaps the rights we have under education or
employment law should now be understood as civil rights, the
protection of which must be guaranteed. But regardless of whether that
claim is right or wrong, this much is certain: we&rsquo;ve lost the
possibility, which was clearly implied by the Civil Rights Act of
1866, that even if not the particular common law rights there
enumerated, there may be <em>some</em> set of legal
rights&mdash;whether federal or state, common law or
statutory&mdash;that may now be, or may become, so fundamental, as to
constitute civil rights, the enforcement and protection of which
should be guaranteed. And because we&rsquo;ve lost it, the importance
of law itself, and of the Rule of Law, to our understanding of civil
society, and of civil life and of civility likewise, is to that degree
diminished.</p>

<h2 id="CivRigAntRig">3. Civil Rights as Antidiscrimination Rights</h2>

<p>
For most twentieth and twenty-first century American lawyers, the
catalogue of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; we indisputably have are
understood to be primarily a product of the various Civil Rights Acts
of the 1960s and their amendments, which were themselves a product of
the politically momentous civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth
century. And what those rights guarantee, mostly, is freedom from
&ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;, both in the private and public sphere,
by which is meant that they give their holder the right to not be
treated differently on the basis of a characteristic, such as race,
that defines the subordinated group of which they are a member. The
narrow goal of the civil rights thereby created in the 1960s was the
end of Jim Crow, or legal apartheid. Their broad goal was and is the
civil, social, and political equality of Black Americans as well as
members of other groups who have suffered some degree of political or
legal subordination. The means by which that goal was to be realized
was, and is, primarily, the creation and enforcement of individual
rights to be free of invidious discrimination (Ackerman 2014; Brest
1976).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Civil rights&rdquo;, on this twentieth and twenty-first century
United States understanding are&mdash;mostly&mdash;rights to be free
of discrimination, and for that reason, it is common now to think of
our &ldquo;civil rights tradition&rdquo; or our &ldquo;civil rights
society&rdquo; as based on what is often called the
&ldquo;antidiscrimination principle&rdquo; (Brest 1976; Hellman 2008;
Bumiller 1988; Ackerman 2014). &ldquo;Civil rights&rdquo; on this
conception are, mostly, &ldquo;antidiscrimination rights&rdquo;, and
what that means is that an individual may not be treated differently
at least in specified fields of life, on the basis of his or her
membership in a group defined by what has come to be called
&ldquo;suspect characteristics&rdquo;: race, sex, gender, ethnicity,
national origin, religion, age, or disability. Thus, &ldquo;Civil
Rights&rdquo; inlude, among others, a civil right against
discrimination in employment, meaning that one cannot be fired, not
hired, or not promoted on the basis of race, pursuant to Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They include rights against
discrimination in housing under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of
1968, which means one cannot be treated differently as a tenant or
buyer or seller on the basis of those traits, and rights against
discrimination in financial markets under the Fair Housing Act of 1968
and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, which means one cannot
be denied credit because of race or other suspect characteristics,
and, pursuant to a complex and now badly shrunken body of law, one has
rights against discrimination in access to voting under the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. This is but a partial list. It bears emphasizing
that the target of these civil rights and civil rights laws is not
only discrimination that was once encoded in law&mdash;the Jim Crow
legislation targeted and struck as unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court in <em>Brown v Board of Education</em> in 1954&mdash;but also,
and much more broadly, discrimination in the &ldquo;private
sphere&rdquo; as well, much of which was completely untouched by that
decision. The target of the wave of civil rights laws passed in the
1960s, and then substantially amended through the rest of the century,
is the dismantling of the legal and social structures that had
governed both public and private life, and which had overtly or
implicitly permitted racist decision-making in government, but also in
private laissez-faire markets. The vehicle for achieving such a
radical transformation of public, private and commercial life was the
creation of a body of <em>law</em>&mdash;with the Civil Rights Acts of
the 1960s at their heart&mdash;coupled with the availability of
private lawsuits for their enforcement (Ackerman 2014).</p>

<p>
The Civil Rights laws of the mid-twentieth century, and with them the
understanding of the antidiscrimination principle, have undergone
significant expansions since their passage in the 1960s. First, the
class of holders of antidiscrimination rights has expanded.
Contemporary civil rights laws now forbid discrimination in the
designated fields on the basis not only of race but also sex,
ethnicity, religion, national origin, age and disability. A campaign
for passage of a proposed Equality Act aims to expand our civil rights
laws to protect gender and sexual minorities as well (Hunter 2015). If
successful, such an Act would grant to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
gender nonconformists the same set of protections against
discriminatory conduct now accorded other groups who have experienced
or still experience irrational animus in private and public life. Some
states have already passed such laws forbidding discrimination against
sexual and gender minorities; Congress however has yet to do so.</p>

<p>
Second, the <em>meaning</em> of the &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; that
is the target of those laws changed, and broadened, significantly. It
no longer means an intentional act that results in the worse treatment
of individuals on the basis of particular characteristics. In
<em>Griggs v Duke Power Company</em>, decided in 1971, the Supreme
Court held that maintaining a policy&mdash;whether or not
intentionally or overtly discriminatory&mdash;that &ldquo;adversely
impacts&rdquo; a suspect group such as Blacks or women constitutes a
violation of Title VII, and hence a civil rights violation, no less
than does intentionally discriminating against that group, if there is
no business-related justification for the practice. In these
&ldquo;adverse impact&rdquo; cases, an intent to discriminate need not
be shown. Rather, if an employer uses a formula, practice, or policy
for hiring, or promotion, or firing, which impacts a protected group
more harshly than the dominant group, and there is no business
justification for the practice, liability may follow. For example, a
test given to applicants which favors native English speakers may
adversely impact ethnic minorities for whom English is a second
language; if there is no business-related justification for the level
of English proficiency for which the test is screening, liability may
follow. The inclusion of these &ldquo;adverse impact&rdquo; cases in
both employment civil rights law and housing law clearly expands the
concept of discrimination itself: the use of such a criterion does not
necessarily reflect discriminatory animus although it might reflect a
negligent or overly casual stance toward the adverse consequences of
criteria employed for selection.</p>

<p>
Third, in the 1980s and 90s, the Supreme Court held, in a series of
cases, that the sexual harassment of working women is also a form of
&ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; actionable under Title VII (<em>Meritor
Savings Bank v Vinson</em>, 1986). Women who suffer either a sexually
harassing environment, or &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo; offers of
promotions or pay raises in exchange for sex, suffer actionable
discrimination, and can sue the employer, whether or not the employer
was the harasser, and whether or not the employer was intentionally
involved with the harassing behavior (MacKinnon 1979). This has since
been expanded to include gender harassment and racial harassment, and
also extended to include schools as well as workplaces. This is a
significant expansion of antidiscrimination law in terms of the
content of what is understood to be discriminatory conduct: it extends
the concept of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; to include, basically,
attempted and completed sexual assaults. But it is also an extension
of the antidiscrimination principle itself, by virtue of including in
the concept of discrimination the maintenance of a
particular&mdash;and particularly assaultive&mdash;working or school
environment. Sexual harassment law is messy, contested, and in some
ways incoherent: it is not clear what the connection is between
harassment and discrimination, and if read broadly, it is not clear
whether it over-polices against harmless and possibly beneficial
sexual banter at work and in schools (Franke 1997; Shultz 2018; Halley
2002). Nevertheless, sexual harassment law has unquestionably expanded
the reach of the antidiscrimination principle, and therefore of our
civil rights. Putting all three of these expansive movements together,
the antidiscrimination principle now includes discriminatory acts
against a much larger group of people than initially prescribed in the
originating laws, includes patterns or practices or policies that
adversely impact those groups, and includes the tolerance or creation
of environments or atmospherics that are harassing on a number of
grounds that go well beyond discriminatory acts of biased or bigoted
employers.</p>

<p>
Taken <em>in toto</em>, the antidiscrimination principle, and the
conception of civil rights it grounds&mdash;basically, that civil
rights are antidiscrimination rights, which are in turn aimed at
achieving a measure of equality for heretofore subordinated groups by
eradicating both the effects of racism, sexism, and ethnic and
religious bigotry, as well as biases against the elderly and disabled,
and in public and private life both&mdash;is the dominant functional
understanding of civil rights in the United States, at least in the
worlds of law, meaning legal practice, judging, and academia. That
said, even with its extensions, the antidiscrimination principle is
clearly under-inclusive. Not all of our legal rights that are also
widely characterized as &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; are
nondiscrimination rights. We also have civil rights to be free of
unconstitutional actions of law enforcement officers, such as searches
or seizures that violate the Fourth Amendment, and regardless of
whether those actions were &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; in any sense
at all (<em>Monroe v Pape</em> 1961; <em>Monell v Dept of Social
Services</em> 1977; <em>Bivens v Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal
Bureau of Narcotics</em> 1971). At various points in the first decades
of the twentieth century, the lawyers in the US Justice
Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;civil rights division&rdquo; pursued labor
rights, in addition to antidiscrimination claims, particularly where
the labor rights would promote the interests or protect the wellbeing
of Black laborers in the South (Goluboff 2001, 2007). More generally,
we also sometimes speak of our &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; to not be
deprived of various constitutionally defined liberties, such as free
speech, thought, and assembly, and, at least until the <em>Dobbs v.
Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization</em> (2022) decision, a
broad panoply of reproductive freedoms as well. These &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo; are held by all who hold those underlying constitutional
rights, and they are not in any obvious way tied to nondiscrimination
norms. We have civil rights, in other words, that are not
&ldquo;nondiscrimination rights&rdquo;, at least, not in any obvious
sense of the meaning of discrimination or its absence.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the &ldquo;antidiscrimination principle&rdquo; captures
the essence of most of the civil rights that were created by law
during the &ldquo;civil rights era&rdquo; of the mid- and
late-twentieth century and recognized by courts ever since. It also
captures at least one of the core aspirations of the civil rights
<em>movement</em> of the middle of the twentieth century, which
mobilized for the passage of these laws, and which had the Jim Crow
regime as its target. Those laws ended the soul crushing
discriminatory exclusions of Black Americans by store owners,
restaurateur and soda counter managers, in hotels, motels, and
taxicabs, and in private schools and colleges (only public grade
schools, colleges, universities and public facilities were directly
targeted by the <em>Brown</em> decision of the decade prior). They
ended the redlining practices of realtors and real estate sellers as
well as the discriminatory treatment of Black tenants by lessors and
landlords. They ended a range of practices, the use of various
criteria, and state-wide policies designed to prevent Blacks but not
whites from exercising the franchise. They ended the discriminatory
treatment of Black and female borrowers by banks and other lenders,
and they put an end to the racially and sexually discriminatory
hiring, firing, and compensation of employees by employers
country-wide.</p>

<p>
The mid-twentieth century civil rights movement, the civil rights laws
which they birthed, and the civil rights those laws in turn created
transformed a nation, ridding it of the legally permitted apartheid in
the worlds of housing, employment, banking and finance,
transportation, public accommodation, voting access and education.
That apartheid had become, for many, the normal white noise of daily
life, and the thousands upon thousands of individual and
discriminatory acts and judgments&mdash;loosely rationalized as
nothing more than individual preferences playing out in laissez faire
markets that accommodate all&mdash;were the mechanism, along with
complicit state actors, for perpetuating it. Taken collectively, the
Civil Rights laws of the mid- to late-twentieth century was the prize
on which so many eyes were kept, for which blood was spilt, and for
which some martyrs&mdash;for whom monuments were eventually
erected&mdash;died. Antidiscrimination is and was the ideal at the
heart of that movement. Having now embraced it, antidiscrimination is
now as much &ldquo;of the essence&rdquo; of our American civic
religion as the freedoms of speech, press, and religion enshrined in
the First Amendment, or the wall between religion and state, or the
separation of powers, or the constitutional rights of privacy that, at
least until recently, were found in the penumbras of our founding
documents.</p>

<h3 id="LimAntPriConMeaVal">3.1 The Limits of the Antidiscrimination Principle: Contested Meanings and Values</h3>

<p>
The antidiscrimination principle, however, no matter how revered, is
not free of difficulty or ambiguity. Partly, this is because the goal
of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; is itself ambiguous, an ambiguity that goes
far beyond the scope of this entry. But the meaning of the guiding
principle of &ldquo;antidiscrimination&rdquo; is also contested. It
isn&rsquo;t clear whether the wrong of &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; is
consciously biased decision-making, or unconsciously biased
decision-making, or the completely unwitting use of criteria that
correlate with a suspect class, or the knowing embrace of practices
that adversely impact a subordinated group, or the neglect of
workplace or schoolhouse atmospherics that hinder the performance or
mar the experiences of members of suspect classes. It likewise
isn&rsquo;t clear what the nondiscriminatory society that is the
target of antidiscrimination law actually requires: whether the goal
of this body of law is a society that is rid of conscious racism and
bias, or one with truly integrated schools and workplaces and
neighborhoods, or one of relative substantive equality between various
groups, whether or not they are integrated, or something other (Bell
1987; Peller 2011; Crenshaw 1988; Fiss 1976; Hellman 2016; Lawrence
1987; Hellman &amp; Moreau 2013; Dorf 2002).</p>

<p>
No matter how defined, however, the antidiscrimination principle is
also now the target of considerable criticism from scholars, judges,
and activists, and across the political spectrum. The earliest,
sustained criticism of the antidiscrimination principle came from
libertarians and free market enthusiasts, including the economist Gary
Becker and Law Professors Richard Epstein and Richard Posner, all from
the University of Chicago (Becker 1971; Epstein 1992, 1995; Posner
1987). This economics-minded group argued on various grounds that
antidiscrimination laws such as Title VII are either inefficient or
unnecessary. They are unnecessary, to whatever degree they police
against discriminatory preferences that are in fact
&ldquo;irrational&rdquo;&mdash;such as a preference, based in
unfounded bigotry, for hiring whites, where Black applicants are
better or equally suited for the work&mdash;because the market, better
than law, will police against these irrational preferences, as it
polices all others, by punishing such employers with higher labor
costs and eventually less market share. Alternatively,
antidiscrimination laws that attempt to police against
&ldquo;rational&rdquo; discriminatory preferences&mdash;by which is
meant preferences that are in fact efficient, because race or sex
(etc.) is being used as a defensible proxy for a trait that is
difficult to identify in applicants but is in fact related to job
performance&mdash;simply mandate inefficiency and are therefore
unwise. The former preferences&mdash;a preference for hiring whites
even where a Black applicant is better suited for the job&mdash;if
irrational, will in effect be punished by the market, as the
employers&rsquo; costs will go up, precisely because they have a less
skilled workforce. If they wish to remain competitive the bigoted
employer will abandon their discriminatory preferences. The latter
preference&mdash;a preference for hiring whites or men over Blacks or
women because race or sex is a good-enough proxy for some other valued
trait&mdash;is rational, and therefore efficient, and therefore not
pernicious. To target &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; through civil
rights laws is therefore nothing more than inefficient governmental
intrusion into private markets.</p>

<p>
Very different criticisms of the antidiscrimination principle were put
forward in the 1980s through the 2000s by successive waves of critical
scholars: first, from scholars identified with the early Critical
Legal Studies movement, and then from Critical Race scholars and
Feminist Legal theorists, all writing within American law schools. For
a number of early critical legal scholars, the
&ldquo;antidiscrimination principle&rdquo; constituted a striking
example of the power of nominally progressive law, particularly in
liberal, legal cultures, to legitimate, in the Gramscian and Marxist
sense of that word, deeper injustices that are not touched by the
progressive reform, including, but not limited to, racial injustices
(Freeman 1978; Peller 1990; Tushnet 1984; Seidman 1992). Thus, the
recognition of and compensation for the wrongs of individual
discriminatory acts and decisions, according to this group of critics,
legitimates and even valorizes what it leaves completely unaddressed:
the unequal employment, health, education, and income inequalities of
generations of Black Americans caused not by individual and
discoverable acts of discrimination, but by the cumulative impact of
centuries of exclusion from educational institutions, decades of
inadequate schooling and health care, unequal access to affordable
housing, itself in part a function of exclusion from programs focused
on home ownership after the World Wars, and the untold but vastly
unequal accumulation of intergenerational wealth, itself a function,
in part, of the centuries of uncompensated slave labor, followed by
discriminatory wage deflation during the decades following
reconstruction. The focus on identifying and then correcting present,
individual acts of discrimination runs the risk of blinding us to
earlier and more damaging patterns of structural or institutional
racism, and their aftermath, by creating individual
&ldquo;wrongdoers&rdquo; and &ldquo;victims&rdquo;, and then conveying
an overly simplistic impression that the inequality that remains, once
the world is rid of intentionally discriminatory acts, is untainted,
and therefore must be fair. To use a metaphor, if we were to lift the
weights off the ankles of some runners halfway around a race course,
so as to create a perception of fairness and equal treatment between
the runners &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo;, this could legitimate the
unequal outcomes at the end of the race, where no attention had been
paid, and no compensation forthcoming, for the weights that hindered
the racers in the first half of the track. The very act of removing
the weights would further entrench the impression that the
inequalities that remain at the end are a function of nature or
inclination.</p>

<p>
Critical Race Scholars in the 1980s, when these critical insights or
claims were first voiced, responded with ambivalence. A number of
African American law professors who were then called &ldquo;minority
scholars&rdquo; argued in response that the critical legal scholars
who targeted the antidiscrimination principle basically for
legitimating other or deeper ills simply failed to see the independent
and searing power of intentional racism in twentieth century life, and
were as a consequence over-inclined to metaphorically short-change
both antidiscrimination norms and the civil rights vision that birthed
them (Crenshaw 1988; Crenshaw et al. 1995; Matsuda 1987; Williams
1991). Nevertheless, critical race scholars over the last three
decades have generally agreed with the critical legal scholars that
the antidiscrimination principle is insufficient, and that it largely
fails to address the magnitude of the injustice attributable to both
past and present racism (Bell 1987; Delgado 1995; Lawrence 2008;
Peller 2011; Crenshaw et al. 1995). For the critical race theorists,
however, the problem with the antidiscrimination principle stemmed not
from its legitimation costs per se, but more simply, from its aiming
at the wrong&mdash;or badly defined&mdash;target. It just isn&rsquo;t
clear how powerful &ldquo;antidiscrimination&rdquo; is as a proxy for
racial equality or even for anti-racism; put differently, it&rsquo;s
not obvious that antidiscrimination laws are either a necessary or a
sufficient condition for the forms of social and political equality
that the civil rights movement that birthed them sought. In
particular, the effects of intergenerational racism&mdash;a century of
exclusion from the enjoyment of public benefits, or the provision of
health services, of overt exclusion from elite schools and
universities, of exclusion through redlining in the distribution of
housing, and deflated wages&mdash;have led to inequalities of wealth,
longevity, health outcomes, educational attainment, and income, that
are simply untouched by the policing of private sphere discrimination.
Whether or not antidiscrimination law &ldquo;legitimates&rdquo; the
structural racism it fails to address, those laws are clearly not
sufficient, if the goal is to address the material inequalities that
still divide white vs black and brown America. The damage that may
potentially be done by the misdirection, though, goes even deeper.
Some measure of intentional, race-conscious, differential treatment on
the basis of race or sex or other characteristics that have
historically defined subordinated groups seems to be a necessary
feature of the various sorts of remedial affirmative action programs
in a range of both public and private institutions, from colleges and
universities to federal, state and local governmental programs
designed to bolster minority participation in the growth of small
business. Laws that prohibit discrimination by mandating
&ldquo;color-blindness&rdquo; may be not only misdirected or
insufficient, but counter-productive, if they imply that the sorts of
affirmative actions taken to achieve these ends are violative of the
antidiscrimination principle at the heart of the Civil Rights vision
itself.</p>

<p>
Feminist legal theorists developed a parallel critique, with a focus
on the impact of the antidiscrimination principle on women&rsquo;s
lived experiences. The antidiscrimination principle, according to its
feminist critics, achieves at most a &ldquo;formal equality&rdquo;
through syllogistic reasoning premised on an assumption of sameness,
or similarity, between men and women. To achieve the formal equality
at which the antidiscrimination principle aims, &ldquo;likes&rdquo;
must be &ldquo;treated alike&rdquo;; and what that means, mostly, is
that Blacks must be treated like whites, and women like men. Blacks
are &ldquo;like&rdquo; whites in all ways that matter and women are
&ldquo;like&rdquo; men, and therefore treating Blacks differently from
whites or women differently from men is an injustice. This syllogism
and the formal equality toward which it aims will backfire, however,
where the two groups are in fact unalike. And women are indeed unlike
men precisely by virtue of the profound subordination of their
interests, over centuries, to men&rsquo;s interests. Consequently,
something more than nondiscrimination is required, if we are to
achieve meaningful progress toward the substantive equality or justice
at which civil rights movements have been aimed. In women&rsquo;s
lives, the need for remedies that go beyond or are simply different
than what might follow from a strict understanding of
&ldquo;antidiscrimination&rdquo; is acute, given palpable differences
in lived experience. The needs of persons who experience pregnancy and
childbirth while employed, for example, are different during those
periods of life from the needs of those who don&rsquo;t and never
will, and applying the same leave, pay, and job security policies to
the two groups across the board will adversely, and severely, affect
women&rsquo;s overall employment prospects (Law 1984). Correcting
discrimination in the workplace, to take a second example,
doesn&rsquo;t address unequal distribution of home labor. And last, as
argued by Catherine MacKinnon throughout her career, the focus on
discrimination is <em>in toto</em> misguided for a more fundamental
reason: sexual assault and violence, rather than different treatment
in workplaces, is the crux, content, and cause of women&rsquo;s
subordination (MacKinnon 1982, 1987(a)(b), 1989). The
antidiscrimination principle applied formally and across the board
provides little beyond a gloss of superficial equality. It may provide
a corrective to the illogical or irrational exclusion of
already-well-off (and therefore similarly situated) women from jobs or
promotions to which they aspire. But it is a massive distraction from
the work of ending the sexual violence and reproductive coercion that
is at the heart of women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; struggles with the
subordination of their interests to that of men.</p>

<p>
Finally, a different and arguably deeper criticism of the
antidiscrimination principle, and the civil rights vision it grounds,
emerged in the late nineties and first couple decades of the
twenty-first century from a group of critical scholars loosely
identified with postmodernism, anticolonialism, and anti-identitarian
politics. These critics resist the limitation of our civil rights to
the antidiscrimination principle, but they also more broadly resist
the association of civil rights and civil rights aspirations with
particular identitarian groups (Brown &amp; Halley 2002). Three major
themes of the &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; critique have emerged. First,
the postmodern critics have emphasized that, simply as a matter of
historical fact, the antidiscrimination principle does not do justice
to the broad moral and political ambitions of the civil rights
movements of the mid-twentieth century, both in the United States and
elsewhere. Antidiscrimination was unquestionably a part of those
movements&mdash;the end of Jim Crow was its oft-stated goal&mdash;but
the movement also targeted entrenched poverty, an end to the
subordination of laborers, an end to imperialist wars, and global
economic injustice, as reflected in the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign
and in Martin Luther King&rsquo;s most revered speeches (Ford 2011).
Viewed most expansively the broad civil rights movement from
mid-twentieth century also had ties to international labor and
anti-colonialist movements, all of which were lost in the inward
looking and thoroughly domestic civil rights laws that were eventually
produced in mid- to late-twentieth century. More generally, though,
according to these critics, the antidiscrimination principle that
emerged in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, and which has guided civil rights
law ever since, is unduly tied to identitarian politics and even ways
of thinking. The focus on discriminatory harms felt by particular
groups blunts our political imagination and ambition, which needs to
expand its scope to conditions felt by all. To take one example: the
extensive accommodations accorded disabled students by virtue of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) inadvertently
highlights&mdash;and then completely neglects&mdash;the inadequacies
of public funding for the education of poor children across the board,
whether disabled or not. There is no apparent reason to privilege
disability over poverty as a cause for inadequate educational
opportunities. Responding to and accommodating the needs of disabled
students legitimates the neglect of impoverished students (Kelman
&amp; Lester 1997). Other postmodern critics have focused on untoward
consequences of other identitarian-tinged civil rights: Janet Halley
has argued, for example, that sexual harassment law has entrenched
hetero norms of sexual privacy and dampened sexual diversity at the
cost of other progressive ideals, aligning feminism with censorial
attitudes toward sexuality in general that have proven harmful (Halley
2002, 2006). These anti-identitarian critics, echoing earlier critics
and some activists, have put into question, and from a left-wing,
socialist, and anti-colonialist perspective, not only the formal
equality of the antidiscrimination principle, but more broadly the
legalism, the inward-looking orientation, and the imaginative
limitations of the civil rights vision itself.</p>

<h3 id="AntPriTod">3.2 The AntiDiscrimination Principle Today</h3>

<p>
The cumulative weight of the economic, critical, and postmodern
critiques of the antidiscrimination principle has been profound.
First, the criticisms put forward by critical scholars eventually led
to the articulation of an alternative &ldquo;anti-subordination
principle&rdquo;, intended as a replacement for the limited
antidiscrimination ideal (Colker 1986; MacKinnon 1987(a)(b)). The
&ldquo;anti-subordination principle&rdquo;, as envisioned by critics
of the antidiscrimination model, would embrace three goals. First, it
would aim to address and understand and articulate the systemic,
rather than individualistic, causes of racism, or sexism, or any other
system of thought and behavior that subordinates entire groups;
second, it would aim to achieve substantive, rather than only formal
or legal equality between these groups; and lastly, it would address
the various forms of subordination occasioned by capitalism and class
hierarchy, including the depressed incomes of working class laborers,
the lack of welfare rights of the poor, environmental harms felt
broadly but also felt more intensely by poor, Black and Brown
communities, and the inadequate education, healthcare, and employment
available to poor persons across the board, all of which are caused by
structural features of liberal capitalism that transcend or are simply
different from the sorts of bigotry, race or sex biases, and simple
racial animus that is targeted by the antidiscrimination principle.
The idea that the anti-subordination principle&mdash;rather than the
antidiscrimination principle&mdash;should guide civil rights law and
aspirations has never become law, but it has become a broadly unifying
commitment of critical legal scholars, critical race theorists,
feminist legal scholars, and some postmodern critics. It promises a
more substantive and experientially informed interpretation of the
overriding goal of equality sought by civil rights, a way out of the
logical traps of the antidiscrimination principle that had mired the
law in an endless regress of what groups of people are
&ldquo;like&rdquo; what other groups, and seemingly promises, if
reflected in law, a more just society for all, rather than only
narrowly identified classes of victims.</p>

<p>
Second, a number of feminist race critics have deepened and enriched
the antidiscrimination principle by focusing on the impact of
antidiscrimination law on persons &ldquo;at the intersection&rdquo; of
various forms of discrimination, and the difficulties posed by
traditional antidiscrimination law in recognizing those injuries
(Crenshaw 1991). Black women are subjected to types of discrimination
not shared by either white women or Black men; and because they are
not so shared, they may be invisible to traditional antidiscrimination
law: a Black woman harassed at work, in ways unique to Black women,
may not be understood as experiencing &ldquo;sex discrimination&rdquo;
if white women are not also targeted, or &ldquo;race
discrimination&rdquo; if the same is not true of Black men. This
intersectionality critique, originally aimed at these cramped
&ldquo;categorizations&rdquo; of traditional antidiscrimination law,
has been significantly broadened in three respects: first,
intersectional theorists now criticize traditional feminism and
antiracism initiatives, as well as the law, for failing to identify
and respond to the needs of people suffering intersectional harms
(Harris 1990). Second, the categories of persons suffering
intersectional harms have been widened to include not only those at
the intersection of race and sex identities, but also those at the
intersection of class, sexuality, disability, and gender
nonconformity. Third: the areas of law now regarded as requiring
intersectional analysis has grown substantially in the 2010s and
2020s, as the harms suffered by intersectional communities,
particularly of race and class, are better appreciated. Poor and Black
communities, for example, suffer distinct and distinctively severe
harms occasioned by climate change; and poor and Black women, to take
a second example, suffer distinct and distinctively severe harms,
occasioned by poor health care. A focus only on discrimination against
women, or discrimination against Blacks, can erase or diminish these
harms.</p>

<p>
More broadly, however, the criticisms of the antidiscrimination
principle, and the civil rights conception it came to define, have
contributed to a general discontent with the centrality of the
antidiscrimination principle shared by broad swaths of the political
spectrum. From libertarian and free-market-leaning scholars, there
continue to be calls to restore less regulated laissez-faire markets
in labor, housing, and sales of goods, that would require the
elimination of the antidiscrimination principle (Epstein 1995). From
the left, there are concerns, most voiced by critical scholars, that
the antidiscrimination principle does too little, and its
&ldquo;legitimating&rdquo; effects and costs outweigh the benefit of
the occasional courtroom victory for individual aggrieved litigants.
Legally, the antidiscrimination principle&mdash;sometimes understood
as requiring &ldquo;colorblind decision-making&rdquo;&mdash;is
increasingly understood by and successfully used by conservative legal
theorists, lawyers, and judges as a way to target affirmative action
programs, minority business preferences, and admissions and employment
policies that aim to fulfill &ldquo;DEI&rdquo; goals of
&ldquo;diversity, equity, and inclusion&rdquo;, all of which had come
to be viewed as sensible remedial actions to earlier and more
structural civil rights violations (<em>Students for Fair Admissions v
Harvard</em> 2022). It is increasingly clear that the
antidiscrimination principle undercuts affirmative action, and if it
does, it is not clear that it will continue to help the groups
originally believed to be the beneficiaries of civil rights laws. At
the same time, the number of successfully litigated traditional
employment discrimination cases is declining rapidly year over year, a
decline fueled by judicially created restraints on class actions,
without which litigation is simply not affordable, and enforceable
&ldquo;mandatory arbitration clauses&rdquo; that divert civil rights
actions to less hospitable arbitration tribunals (Glover 2006). On
campuses, Title IX (1972) actions to enforce students&rsquo; rights
against sexual assault or harassment, long viewed as implied by the
antidiscrimination principle, are mired in procedural challenges and
process disputes (Cantalupo 2020). In 2014, Yale Law School Professor
Bruce Ackerman, our chronicler par excellence of the twentieth
century&rsquo;s civil rights movement and the law it produced,
declared, on the first page of his magisterial treatment of that
tradition, that the &ldquo;civil rights era&rdquo; is entering its
sunset years (Ackerman 2014). To whatever degree our civil rights are
at heart nondiscrimination rights, the same may be true of our civil
rights laws as well.</p>

<h2 id="CivRigRigFlo">4. Civil Rights as Rights to Flourish</h2>

<p>
A number of contemporary, twenty-first century civil rights movements,
and contemporary understandings of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; those
movements imply, are not fully captured by even an expansive
conception of the antidiscrimination principle. The movements that
today are characterized as civil rights movements do not have any
apparent causal or thematic connection with particular acts of
animus-driven individual discrimination. Nor do they readily align
with the legal protectionist conception implied by the 1866 and 1870s
Civil Rights Acts. Do we have, for example, a civil right to a clean
environment? The &ldquo;environmental justice&rdquo; movement, that
aims to highlight and rectify the disproportionate environmental harms
sustained by Black, Brown and poor communities, argues that we do, or
should (UCC Commission for Racial Justice 1987; Bullard 1990). Do we
have or should we have a civil right to assistance with the costs of
care for dependents? Ann Alstott, a tax professor at Yale, argued as
much in a book length treatment advocating a one-time payment to all
new caregivers on the birth of children, so as to ensure the ability
of the caregiver to continue to participate in either educational or
labor markets (Alstott 2004). Do we have a civil right to health,
health care, or health care insurance? Proponents of the Affordable
Care Act of 2010 and its expansion certainly argue as much. Do we have
a civil right to some minimum measure of safety from gun violence?
Proponents of stronger gun safety laws have characterized their
campaign for gun control laws as <em>the</em> quintessential civil
rights cause of the day, or perhaps of their generation. Do we have a
civil right to a sound education, or to support during retirement, or
to assistance with basic necessities such as food and shelter? If we
have civil rights to these benefits, and not just a strong moral case
for them, as many advocates claim, then we have (or should have) these
civil rights absolutely and across the board, not simply to whatever
degree some of us have been discriminatorily denied what law might
otherwise promise. And, if we have them, we have them even though
there may yet be no existing law that promises protection from these
harms. If these existing or possible &ldquo;civil
rights&rdquo;&mdash;rights to a high quality education, to a job, to
welfare rights, to a clean environment, to health care, to safety from
gun violence, to help with the expenses of retirement or child or
elder care, or to a minimum guaranteed income&mdash;are civil rights,
or possible civil rights, then the phrase &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;
clearly means something beyond the rights of antidiscrimination that
came to the foreground in the second half of the twentieth century, or
rights to the equal protection to existing law, as the phrase was
likely understood at the close of the Civil War.</p>

<p>
Some of these hoped for civil rights do have some relation&mdash;even
if tenuous&mdash;to antidiscrimination or equal protection ideals. The
environmental justice movement aims to achieve environmental gains for
poor communities&mdash;disproportionately Black and Brown&mdash;that
are themselves disproportionately harmed by pollutants and the effects
of climate change, and would most benefit by such a civil right, once
translated into strengthened environmental protection laws. If so,
then a civil right to environmental justice could and should be viewed
as partially resting on either an antidiscrimination or
anti-subordination understanding of civil rights. The civil right to
gun safety advocated by the gun control movement bears a resemblance
to equal protection understandings of civil rights from the post-civil
war era: the state&rsquo;s lack of control of commercial weaponry
echoes the southern states&rsquo; lack of control of white supremacy,
with the resulting violence disproportionately impacting Black
communities in both centuries. The still hoped-for civil right to
greater assistance with child care and elder care would most benefit
poor and female caregivers, echoing the antidiscrimination principle,
as it pertains to women and mothers. Nevertheless these as well as
other pressing contemporary civil rights movements, such as campaigns
for welfare rights to food, housing, health care and education, are
clearly not limited to claims to the protection of existing
law&mdash;they are arguments for the creation of new law, not for a
right to the protection of existing law&mdash;and would clearly be
universalist in scope and ambition, rather than tied to any
recognizable theory of discrimination. This new generation of
&ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; laws may indeed disproportionately impact,
and favorably, disadvantaged communities; in fact they almost
undoubtedly would. But the heart of the civil right, in all of these
cases, would be a right to a flourishing life, not a right to not
suffer discrimination or a right to the protections of existing
laws.</p>

<p>
All of these contemporary &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; campaigns in some
way aim for equality, as did the civil rights campaigns in the two
earlier eras that gave rise to civil rights laws. They all target
harms that disproportionately impact disadvantaged communities and
would thereby disproportionately benefit them, were they to lead to
positive law. But these contemporary civil rights campaigns are
strikingly different from their twentieth and nineteenth century
counterparts, and in two ways. First, as noted, discrimination itself
is not the most pressing or immediate wrong that is at their heart.
The harms they are addressing are environmental harms, or economic
harms, or harms brought on by violent firearms, or educational
deficits, or inadequate housing or health care. And second, the law
that is the core of the civil right being sought is
<em>aspirational</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t already exist. This new
generation of civil rights are not rights to legal benefits already
enjoyed by one majoritarian group but not extended to a minority
group. Rather, there is <em>no</em> law, an absence which hurts us
all, albeit some more than others: the problem is not that an existing
environmental law extends its protections to whites but not Blacks, or
that some parents but not others receive state assistance with
childcare, or that some but not others are accorded the protection of
the criminal law against gun violence. Some of those discriminations
may indeed occur, and when they do, they can be rooted out, under the
antidiscrimination principle. But for the most part these new civil
rights assert rights to new law&mdash;to have law, where no law
currently exists. They are rights to the protection of not-yet-enacted
but needed positive law. The law we currently have is not the
baseline. Rather, the law we should have is&mdash;it should be created
and extended equally.</p>

<p>
These new civil rights are therefore based, philosophically, not on
whatever vision of a good state and a good life is implied by existing
law, coupled with a demand of equal protection or nondiscrimination,
but instead on some conception of human flourishing&mdash;not drawn
from existing law&mdash;that should be protected by law, but currently
is not. Their baseline is not solely the idea that the law we have
should protect all of us, or that it should not discriminate among us.
It is, rather, the idea that law should promote the human good, and
human flourishing (Nussbaum 2000, 2006). A healthy planet, meaningful
work, a decent education, and safety in our private lives and
communities are prerequisites for flourishing lives. The latest
generation of civil rights aims to press law toward the project of
creating the legal preconditions for individual and collective lives
to flourish. The civil rights now being urged by their advocates are
rights that the state be enlisted in the collective effort to ensure
that law does so.</p>
