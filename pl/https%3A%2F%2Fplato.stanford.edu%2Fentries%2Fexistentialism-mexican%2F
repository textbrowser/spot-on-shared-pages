<h1>Mexican Existentialism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Mar 29, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Mexican existentialism grows out of the encounter, engagement, and
appropriation with French and German existentialist philosophies in
Mexico mid-way through the twentieth-century. Key players in this
tradition were Jos&eacute; Gaos (1900&ndash;1969), Antonio Caso
(1883&ndash;1946), and, especially, <em>el grupo Hiperi&oacute;n</em>
(the Hyperion Group). Members of Hyperion, but particularly Emilio
Uranga (1921&ndash;1988), Leopoldo Zea (1912&ndash;2004), Jorge
Portilla (1918&ndash;1963), and Luis Villoro (1922&ndash;2014),
focused their efforts on existential reinterpretations of <em>that
which is Mexican</em> (&ldquo;lo mexicano&rdquo; or Mexicanness), a
focus that lends this tradition its historical and conceptual
uniqueness and importance.</p>

<h2 id="BriHisBac">1. Brief Historical Background</h2>

<p>
European existentialism made its way into Mexico in the late 1930s. A
growing enthusiasm among young Mexican intellectuals for philosophical
analyses of situated existence helped its spread. By the early 1940s,
popular seminars on Martin Heidegger&rsquo;s <em>Being and Time</em>
fueled a growing interest into a &ldquo;Mexican Dasein,&rdquo; or
Mexican existence. These seminars were led by recent European
arrivals, Spanish exiles fleeing the Spanish Civil War
(1936&ndash;1939). Crucial amongst these are Jos&eacute; Gaos and Juan
David Garc&iacute;a Bacca (1901&ndash;1992) who, through lectures,
books, and translations laid the groundwork for a unique and
impassioned appropriation of existentialism that would come to define
Mexican philosophy for years to come. Ultimately, what is now called
&ldquo;Mexican existentialism&rdquo; emerges from readings and
reaction to Heidegger and the French existentialists (particularly
Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others) originally introduced by Gaos,
Bacca, and others. Key to its growth were the efforts of <em>el</em>
<em>grupo Hiperi&oacute;n</em>, or the Hyperion Group (named after one
of the twelve Greek Titan gods [Reyes 2004: 15]). Between 1947 and
1952, Hyperion read, interpreted, and promoted a version of French and
German existentialism that they then applied to their own and unique
historical, cultural, and existential moment. Some members of the
Group believed that existentialism offered the conceptual resources
necessary to bring about &ldquo;<em>moral, social, and religious
transformations</em>&rdquo; in Mexican society (Uranga 1952 [2021:
94]) and &ldquo;the very instrument with which to interpret Mexican
reality&rdquo; (Zea 1968: 12). Others, like Portilla, were a bit more
dramatic, suggesting that the existentialist attitude was the natural
attitude of Mexicans, especially given their history of struggle and
overcoming, writing, &ldquo;it might be said that we Mexicans are
existentialist from birth&rdquo; (Portilla 1949 [2017: 186]).</p>

<p>
The Mexican appropriation of existentialism was never meant to be
faithful to any one (European) approach. Early on, Luis Villoro
(1919&ndash;2014) referred this appropriation as a &ldquo;partial
acceptance of existentialism in our day&rdquo; which, he emphasized,
&ldquo;responds to a concrete situation&rdquo; (1949: 233). This was
an important qualification because Mexican philosophers could not
expect their philosophical conclusions to perfectly echo those of
their European counterparts. So the acceptance of existentialism was
to be &ldquo;partial&rdquo; or, said differently, ultimately to be
determined by the concrete realities of the Mexican social, cultural,
and historical situation.</p>

<p>
What follows will not be a detailed historical outline of this effort
(a lot of this history is included in the entry on
 <a href="../philosophy-mexico/">philosophy in Mexico</a>&mdash;see
 also Hurtado 2006; Merrim 2023). Instead, we consider its results,
presented here as a (non-exhaustive) conceptual inventory referencing
some of the most important insights of this tradition&mdash;the
contents of what has previously been called
&ldquo;(M)existentialism&rdquo; (S&aacute;nchez 2019, 2023).</p>

<h2 id="ConInvMexExi">2. Conceptual Inventory of Mexican Existentialism</h2>

<h3 id="FreCirRes">2.1 Freedom, Circumstance, and Responsibility</h3>

<p>
S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard&rsquo;s definition of freedom as &ldquo;the
possibility of possibility&rdquo; prefigures what 20<sup>th</sup>
century existentialists will say about this topic (Kierkegaard 1844
[2015]). In broad strokes, it is said that freedom makes possible a
subject&rsquo;s capacity to choose one course of action among many.
This freedom to choose, however, is constrained, according to
existentialists such as Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In
her view, de Beauvoir thinks the possibilities afforded by freedom are
always limited by something external to the agent, e.g., traditions,
situations, history (Beauvoir 2004). Mexican existentialists further
particularize this view, proposing that for the Mexican subject
freedom is enacted in a conscious choosing among possibilities availed
to it by the <em>Mexican circumstance</em>. For Mexican
existentialists, the goal of thinking of freedom in this way (as a
movement toward possibilities) is freedom itself, or the intellectual
liberation from the colonial inheritance and its various
manifestations. Mexican existentialists thus understand freedom in the
context of historical determinations (colonial oppression) and as the
capacity to transcend them, which happens when they are affirmed in
acts of criticism, commitment, and responsibility. In this sense,
freedom only makes sense as a choosing to commit oneself to the
circumstance into which on is thrown and assuming the responsibilities
that this thrownness requires. Freedom, commitment, and responsibility
thus go hand in hand. Let&rsquo;s consider these ideas one at a
time.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Freedom</h4>

<p>
Freedom reveals itself in the willingness both to commit and to assume
responsibility for our commitments. Because commitment requires taking
an exclusionary position on certain values or norms, and because
making such choices is only available in freedom, choosing to commit
oneself to the <em>right</em> values or norms is the best expression
of our freedom. The right values or norms will be those that, in
choosing to commit ourselves to them, make us responsible for the
wellbeing of our neighbors, for the future of our community, or for
the health of our circumstance. Leopoldo Zea says: &ldquo;our freedom
is expressed in the form in which we assume the inevitable commitment
to our circumstance&rdquo; (1952 [2017: 126]). In this way, the end of
freedom is something other than freedom. Freedom is not an end in
itself (Mu&ntilde;oz 1953: 78), but always a means to empower our
circumstance, conceived not as an abstract, universal ideal, but as a
real and concrete <em>place</em>.</p>

<p>
Historical systems of oppression operative since the time of conquest
and colonization of Mexico have rendered the Mexican person indecisive
and &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; (see below). Liberation from these
long-standing oppressions requires reclaiming one&rsquo;s power,
understood as the subject&rsquo;s ability to properly choose and to
act on those choices. Emilio Uranga says that liberation is possible
when we &ldquo;dislodge [ourselves] from systems of inferior
motivations&rdquo; (1951 [2017: 170]), while Jorge Portilla writes
that it involves dismantling the totalizing and objectifying
&ldquo;perspective of the stranger&rdquo; (1949 [2017: 182]). Being
properly free or liberated thus involves a recognition of one&rsquo;s
oppression (Macgregor 1948: 278) and, on this basis, the performance
of &ldquo;morally determining&rdquo; actions (Uranga 1951 [2017: 170])
that "dislodge" us from it (our various constraints&nbsp;or
objectifications) so that we may positively contribute to the
well-being of our neighbor&nbsp;or our circumstance. Because they are
to&nbsp;be <em>morally</em> determining, our actions will take the
form of responsible commitments to concrete others and not to ideals
or abstractions&mdash;for instance, to &ldquo;humanity in
general.&rdquo; Freedom is thus to be understood, then, as
&ldquo;situated&rdquo; and &ldquo;committed&rdquo; (Zea 1952 [2017:
135]). This is a &ldquo;[r]esponsible freedom, [one] aware of its
limits&rdquo; (135). On such an account, freedom and responsibility
are two sides of the same coin; or as Zea puts it, &ldquo;[w]here
there is no responsibility, there is no freedom&rdquo; (135). Portilla
concurs: &ldquo;To the extent that this person becomes
responsible,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;he or she becomes free, and to
the extent that this person becomes free, he or she affirms themselves
as a human being&rdquo; (Portilla 1966 [2012: 162]). In other words,
liberation from oppression&mdash;physical or psychological, colonial
or otherwise&mdash;depends on taking responsibility for, and acting on
behalf of, the concrete situation or circumstance in which one finds
oneself. Choosing responsible and committed action is the essence of
freedom.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Circumstance</h4>

<p>
Mexican existentialism responds to a particular Mexican crisis. It is
a historical crisis of identity, of belonging, and of values. The
philosophical models and approaches needed to address this crisis must
be rooted in the Mexican circumstance. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; writes
Leopoldo Zea, &ldquo;if we are to be faithful to our calling, we have
to affirm that our <em>situation</em> is not that of Jean-Paul Sartre.
Our situation is not that of the European bourgeoisie&rdquo; (1952
[2017: 137]). Zea&rsquo;s point is two-fold: the first, which is an
obvious point, is that both the Mexican and the European situations
are qualitatively different; and two, that given its own moral
failings, central among these the catastrophe of the Holocaust, Europe
has lost the moral authority to serve as a model to anyone, but
especially Latin American philosophers seeking a philosophical
orientation. The general idea motivating Zea is that human existence
is necessarily situational, conditioned by space and time, and that
philosophy itself emerges from reflecting on that situation&mdash;on
its past, present, and future. These reflections constitute the core
of Mexican existentialism.</p>

<p>
Existentialism in Mexico grows in popularity in the late 1940s. The
groundwork for this growth, however, was laid decades before, with the
introduction into Mexico of
 <a href="../gasset/">Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset&rsquo;s</a>
 (1883&ndash;1955) notion of &ldquo;vital reason&rdquo; in the 1920s.
Ortega&rsquo;s doctrine of vital reason privileges perspective and
situatedness over abstractness and rational detachment, proposing that
what matters is how human beings respond to their own particular
circumstance. In his <em>Meditations on Quixote</em>, written in 1914,
the Spanish philosopher introduces the centrality of circumstance in
his anti-Cartesian &ldquo;circumstantialist&rdquo; principle: &ldquo;I
am myself and my circumstance, and if I don&rsquo;t save it, I
don&rsquo;t save myself&rdquo; (Ortega 1999: 45; see also Romanell
1951). What this principle conveys is that what is truly meaningful
about one&rsquo;s life is not something intangible, but something
concrete, namely the place where one stands, the everyday details that
make one up, or those things that create one&rsquo;s identity in
context. In a brief, illuminating phrase, it describes the nature of
one&rsquo;s identity (which is a marriage of <em>self</em> and
<em>circumstance</em>) and, also, what one needs to do on its behalf
(namely, &ldquo;save it,&rdquo; or preserve it by understanding it,
advocating for it, or loving it). Circumstance, or in its Latin,
<em>circum</em> and <em>stantia</em>, refers to that which <em>stands
around</em>, including mountains, streets, forests, sky, or the
totality of the environment&hellip;these are all
&ldquo;circumstance.&rdquo; But &ldquo;circumstance&rdquo; is also
language, culture, tradition, history, existing social relations. In
sum, the circumstance is the totality of that <em>habitat</em> in
which I find myself and that could identify me, inform me, or
constitute me.</p>

<p>
Ortega&rsquo;s &ldquo;circumstantialist&rdquo; principle takes the
form of an equation where the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; is the sum total of a
&ldquo;self&rdquo; and the self&rsquo;s &ldquo;circumstance&rdquo;
(myself + circumstance = I am). The suggestion here is that the
&ldquo;I am&rdquo; is not reducible merely to an &ldquo;I think&rdquo;
or identical merely to itself. The &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; that is, is a
product of an ego in a circumstance, in that situation in which it
finds itself. The second part of the principle, moreover, says that if
the circumstances cannot be &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; then the
&ldquo;myself&rdquo; cannot be saved. This simply points back to the
essential connection between myself and the circumstance that inform
the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; and the commitment and responsibility this
implies. The circumstance limits me, but also affords me the ways in
which I can respond to it. Mexican existentialists centered this
principle in their philosophical project, imagining their identities
as irrevocably tied to their circumstance, both in crisis and both
demanding to be saved.</p>

<p>
To be free is to become aware of my determination in a circumstance
and choosing to commit myself to it in responsible ways&mdash;in other
words, to engage my world. This means that freedom cannot be radical
in the sense of a being unconstrained by any obstacle; the
circumstance is an obstacle, it stands before us and must be dealt
with&mdash;the way we deal with it determines us as free (Uranga 1947:
6). Thus, in freedom I affirm my subjectivity and I do this in
responsibility committing myself to my circumstance. For Mexican
existentialists, this takes the form of choosing to commit myself to
the world <em>as I find it</em> and taking responsibility for it (for
the sake of&nbsp;&ldquo;saving&rdquo; it) precisely because of the
state in which I find it.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Responsibility</h4>

<p>
Of course, in one&rsquo;s exercise of freedom, one can choose not to
choose. But in Mexican existentialism, this unwillingness to choose
(<em>desgana</em>: see below), rather than an expression of freedom,
is seen as a form of withdrawal from the world, a refusal to be free.
Freedom requires the willingness to choose, along with the willingness
to commit oneself to what is chosen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
But how does one&nbsp;choose one&rsquo;s commitments and
responsibilities? Leopoldo Zea proposes a hierarchy of commitments and
responsibilities, where commitment to and responsibility for
one&rsquo;s concrete situation or circumstance sits at the top, while
commitment to or responsibility for ideas or abstractions fall
somewhere below that. He writes: &ldquo;Committing ourselves to the
universal and the eternal, without making a single concrete
commitment, does not commit us to anything&rdquo; (Zea 1952 [2017:
138]). For instance, as philosophers, it is possible to commit
ourselves to ideals or abstractions, such as universal moral
imperatives. However, it is more valuable and worthwhile, Zea
proposes, if we commit ourselves to ideas and concepts connected to
what we actually see and experience. This is because for Zea,
&ldquo;existentialism does not wish to elude reality, does not evade
it, it confronts it, assuming it with all of its consequences&rdquo;
(Zea 1949).</p>

<p>
Echoing Sartre and the European existentialist tradition, Zea says
that &ldquo;every person is a committed agent, that is, inserted,
<em>thrown</em>, or placed in a world in which they must act and for
which they must be responsible&rdquo; (Zea 1952 [2017: 126]). Where
Zea diverges is in suggesting that the world in which we are thrown is
not &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; or that abstract landscape where
&ldquo;mankind&rdquo; or &ldquo;humankind&rdquo; makes its home; the
world of Zea and the Mexican existentialists is the non-European
world, the conquered, colonized, and peripheral world of the
non-European &ldquo;other&rdquo;&mdash;the Americas (Larroyo 1951). As
Uranga puts it: &ldquo;There is no world which is pure, neither is
there pure consciousness; rather, there is always a consciousness in a
situation, or commitment, which means at once a thrownness toward the
world and the possibility to return to it so as to acquire a
consciousness of the sense and essence of our commitment&rdquo;
(Uranga 1949: 227). Once consciousness of the particularity of this,
Mexican, world is &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; then the choice becomes
clear: to commit or to flee, to be responsible or to be unwilling. For
Zea, as with the rest of the Mexican existentialist, fleeing and
unwillingness are not authentic options: &ldquo;We have to take
responsibility for a past not of our making: yet at the same time,
with our attitude, whatever it might be, we commit and take
responsibility for a future that must be made by us. In this way, we
are responsible for others in the presence of others. This, in short,
is the essence of commitment&rdquo; (1952 [2017: 127]). In Mexico, as
in other historical geographies with a defined colonial inheritance,
the sort of commitments and responsibilities that Zea and Uranga have
in mind involve confronting the colonial past, challenging it, and,
ultimately overcoming it, while keeping a firm grasp on the future.
This sort of work is done via political action, journalism, speaking
for those who cannot speak for themselves, and the kind of critical
unmasking of which philosophy is capable. In this sense, commitment to
philosophy is a form of responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="Acc">2.2 Accidentality</h3>

<p>
A key concept in Mexican existentialism is
&ldquo;accidentality.&rdquo; Accidentality refers to the <em>being of
the accident,</em> or to the mode of existence belonging to concrete
beings lacking in &ldquo;substantial consistency&rdquo; (Portilla 1949
[2017: 186]). In the context of this tradition, what is substantially
consistent is unaffected by space, time, or circumstance (by
&ldquo;history&rdquo;); importantly, substantial consistency is
central to the Eurocentric ideal of humanity, or the idea of
&ldquo;the human&rdquo; or &ldquo;humanity in general&rdquo; (Uranga
1952 [2021: 107]). To be an accident in relation to this ideal is thus
to be an insufficient, and even dependent, instantiation of that
ideal. Accidentality&mdash;<em>insubstantial
inconsistency</em>&mdash;is a being &ldquo;less than&rdquo; the ideal
of humanity and any of the ways this ideal is represented in culture,
history, or society.</p>

<p>
Emilio Uranga describes the accident as &ldquo;fragility&rdquo; due to
its relation of dependency to the ideal, or to
&ldquo;substance.&rdquo; He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
The accident is fragility: oscillation between being and nothingness.
This means that its &ldquo;fit&rdquo; in being, its adhesion to being
expressed in the modality of being-in, is not protected by an
inalienable right, but rather whatever may be the form of its
inherence, it is always revocable. The accident is constantly
threatened by displacement [<em>desalojamiento</em>]. Attached to
being, it can always be torn off from its &ldquo;there,&rdquo;
exterminated. Whatever it holds on to, whatever handle it grabs on to,
can be removed. It was born to be-in and at the same time to
not-be-in. (Uranga 1952 [2021: 116])
</blockquote>

<p>
While Uranga proposes that accidentality, as this fragile relation to
being (to substance), characterizes the Mexican experience in
particular, what he means is that Mexican persons <em>recognize</em>
it as such, and they do so as a result of sharing in the trauma of
their own history, which is one of violence, uprootedness,
marginalization, and hardship. Such recognition demands thinking of
life itself as revocable, finite, subject to precarity or
extermination.</p>

<p>
Accidentality has an established philosophical historiography.
Aristotle says that substance is primary and self-sufficient and that
the accident is secondary and dependent. Accidents are accidental
attributes of substance. Applied to persons, these categories and
distinctions mean that those who are substantial are self-sufficient
and necessary while those that are accidental are inessential,
dependent, and insufficient. Persons defined by accidentality will be
those that &ldquo;through a thousand accidents of history, of culture
or society, have been framed by the catastrophic&rdquo; (1952 [2021:
185]). Those framed by the catastrophic are familiar with historical
violence and finitude and understand the world through their
accidentality, that is, as precarious and finite. Uranga suggests that
Mexicans in particular, but also, and in general, peoples living in
the peripheries of world history, in its margins and undersides, have
been framed&mdash;and frame themselves&mdash;in this way. (An
alternative reconstruction of accidentality is offered by Vargas
2020).</p>

<p>
We can think of accidentality, then, in a metaphysical sense as a
deficiency or a lack-of-being before substance. Mexican
existentialists, like Uranga, explicitly reject substance metaphysics
in favor of a metaphysics of the accident where accidentality is all
there is, thus revealing <em>individual</em> human life as
indeterminate, ungrounded, and always already abandoned onto its
context. No matter how connected I <em>feel</em> to substance, whether
that comes in the form of God, the State, Capitalism, and so on, this
relation will always be fragile, breakable, and uncertain. This
uncertain relation to what only seems substantially independent
ultimately exposes my temporality, my finitude, and my
accidentality.</p>

<p>
A prescriptive upshot in Uranga&rsquo;s existential philosophy of
accidentality is that keeping one&rsquo;s accidentality firmly in mind
is good for the business of life, and this for at least two reasons.
One, in recognizing it and affirming it, we become more sensitive to
our finitude or our human limitations. This in turn refocuses our
existential concerns to what is most important, such as the needs of
others, our own well-being, and our determinate circumstance. And two,
recognizing our accidentality strips us of the self-delusion that we
can ever achieve &ldquo;substantiality&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., absolute
self-independence or perfection.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Substantialization</h4>

<p>
Substantialization is the opposite of accidentality. It is the
(illusory) belief that one&rsquo;s being, identity, or purpose is
stable, determined, and self-sufficient. According to Uranga,
&ldquo;substantialization&rdquo; [<em>sustancialidad</em>] is an
obstacle to the liberation of the Mexican mind.
&ldquo;Substantialization&rdquo; remains today as an aspirational
ideal by those who believe in the superiority of classes, cultures,
races, or ideals. Uranga thinks that the ideal of substantialization
is &ldquo;inhuman.&rdquo; It is inhuman because it needlessly and
harmfully divides people into those who are&nbsp;"substance" and those
who are "accident," which is a false division because it&nbsp;is not
humanly possible for <em>anybody</em> to actually <em>be</em>
substance in the sense described. Liberation from this ideal means
awakening Mexican consciousness to the recognition of what is most
human and most true about human existence, namely,
&ldquo;accidentality.&rdquo; In <em>Analysis of Mexican Being</em>,
Uranga proposes that what distinguishes Mexicans from other peoples
(especially Europeans) is the fact that they have &ldquo;an ear&rdquo;
to their accidentality, to the terrifying realization that their lives
are both a product of chance and always on the brink of
&ldquo;extermination&rdquo; (116).</p>

<p>
For finite beings, substantiality is not an aspirational ideal.
No&nbsp;one can ever <em>become</em> substance. Now, while Uranga has
in mind the harm caused by the myth of substantiality to the Mexican
sense of self, today we can see it play out, for instance, in the
United States, in those cultural and social conceptions of immigrants
and refugees as &ldquo;insufficiently&rdquo; human, or insufficiently
civilized, compared to &ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;real&rdquo; or
&ldquo;authentic&rdquo; &ldquo;American&rdquo; citizens. As
insufficient, immigrants and refugees are thus treated as inessential
to life itself, and as accidental to it (see Mendoza 2016;
S&aacute;nchez 2014). The truth is, however, that insufficiency is the
essence of the concrete, so even the rich, the powerful,
&ldquo;Americans,&rdquo; or &ldquo;citizens,&rdquo; and so on, can
never achieve, nor can they aspire to, the substantial being that they
may claim for themselves. We are all insufficient, inessential, and
accidental to life, to the planet, to the universe.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Insufficiency</h4>

<p>
&ldquo;Insufficiency&rdquo; [<em>Insuficiencia</em>] is a mode of
accidentality. It is the ontological correlate to the psychological
&ldquo;complex of inferiority.&rdquo; The latter is the
<em>feeling</em> of impotence and inadequacy that can overwhelm a
person in the presence of something that appears superior or
&ldquo;better than.&rdquo; It is originally posited in response to
Samuel Ramos (1934) suggestion that an essential characteristic of the
Mexican people was a shared feeling of inferiority explained much of
their behavior toward themselves and one another. Against Ramos,
Uranga argues that the Mexican inferiority complex is but a symptom of
a much deeper <em>human</em> condition, namely, accidentality
experienced as insufficiency. In other words, the Mexican experience
as inferiority is really a foundational (or ontological) insufficiency
that describes every finite, mortal, and bounded human experience
(Uranga 1952 [2021]). Recognition of insufficiency is, as is the case
with accidentality, empowering. By recognizing and accepting this
existential and ontological insufficiency, Mexicans are always closer
to the truth of being human and, in in doing so, are far more
authentic than their European/North American counterparts. In short,
insufficiency describes the mode of being of the human as always
already deficiency in being&mdash;in existential terms, it describes
the human being&rsquo;s perpetual project of becoming.</p>

<h3 id="Nep">2.3 Nepantla</h3>

<p>
The concept of &ldquo;nepantla&rdquo; has an established
historiography in English-language Latinx scholarship. Primarily
associated with Latinx/Chicanx feminism, and in particular with the
work of Gloria Anzald&uacute;a (1942&ndash;2004), it has come to name
the social, political, and gendered status of those who live
&ldquo;in-between&rdquo; cultures, in-between gendered and linguistic
spaces, in-between differential sites of oppression and
marginalization, and so on. However, the concept has a long history
outside of that historiography, one intertwined with the Nahuatl
experience of European colonization and displacement. It is from this
tradition that it is appropriated by Mexican existentialist, where
<em>nepantla</em> has one or all of the following meanings:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li><em>Nepantla</em> is an ontological concept that refers to a
<em>suspension between commitments or worlds</em> that is indicative
of the &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; tendency toward indetermination,
fluidity, and accidentality.</li>

<li><em>Nepantla</em> captures the <em>always being on the way</em>,
i.e., the nomadism of those in-between worlds, but of also of the
world-less, those who have been displaced by social, political, or
other forces. It is sometimes referred to as a <em>never again/never
yet</em> structure (S&aacute;nchez 2023, 53&ndash;68).</li>

<li><em>Nepantla</em> describes an existential <em>refusal</em> to
commit, a <em>neutrality</em> regarding direct action on the
circumstances in which some find themselves, circumstances which
oftentimes offer no true living option. This can describe persons who
exist with inherited oppressive existential situations and who,
considering them as inadequate, refuse to commit themselves to
them.</li>

<li>Finally, <em>nepantla</em> is the &ldquo;in between&rdquo;
temporalities, worlds, processes; it is being &ldquo;in the
middle,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;on the way,&rdquo; in transit, from one
place to another, or &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo; as in &ldquo;in the
midst of&rdquo; a crisis or a paradigm shift.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These different ways to characterize <em>nepantla</em> revolve around
a central axis, neatly summarized in the concept of
&ldquo;in-betweenness.&rdquo; There are different kinds of
&ldquo;in-betweenness&rdquo; across every imaginable human experience,
and so <em>nepantla</em> can be considered a category of human
being.</p>

<p>
<em>Nepantla</em> is mentioned only twice in the main text of Emilio
Uranga&rsquo;s <em>Analysis of Mexican Being</em> (1952 [2021]), yet
he argues that it is <em>the</em> key &ldquo;ontological&rdquo;
concept in Mexican existentialism. Uranga writes that &ldquo;[t]he
Mexican character does not install itself over&hellip;two agencies,
but between [<em>entre</em>] them. The nahuatl term
<em>&rdquo;nepantla</em>&ldquo; captures this phenomenon perfectly; it
means &lsquo;in between,&rsquo; in the middle, in the center. We thus
have before us, in all its purity, the central category of our
ontology, autochthonous, one that does not borrow from the Western
tradition&hellip;&rdquo; (Uranga 1952 [2021]: 167). As &ldquo;the
central category&rdquo; of this tradition, <em>nepantla</em> defies
the Western philosophical tradition by insisting on the ontological
priority of indeterminateness and fluidity. Proposing it as such is an
important strategic move, since motivating Mexican existentialists is
an attempt to confront and overcome suffocating colonial prejudices
regarding who and what they are.</p>

<p>
Mexican existentialism thus recovers and re-appropriates the Nahuatl
notion of &ldquo;nepantla&rdquo; to designate Mexicans as
&ldquo;in-between&rdquo; a seemingly endless journey that continues to
take them further away from determinate and established identities. In
a more general sense, this designation is also strategic, as it allows
whoever defines themselves as <em>nepantla</em> to remain neutral in
response to claims made on their identity by others&mdash;as
<em>napantla</em>, that is, one can allow oneself to refuse the rigid
of objectifications of the crowd.</p>

<h3 id="Zoz">2.4 Zozobra</h3>

<p>
About <em>nepantla</em>, Uranga (1952 [2013]) writes: &ldquo;This is
<em>nepantla</em>. Not a &lsquo;synthesis,&rsquo; but an
&lsquo;oscillation,&rsquo; to &lsquo;go from one end to another
without rest.&rsquo; The <em>mood</em> [<em>estado de animo</em>] that
communicates this <em>structure of being</em> is precisely
&lsquo;zozobra.&rsquo; In the <em>mood</em> of zozobra we do not know
what to depend on, we vacillate between one and another
&lsquo;law,&rsquo; we are &lsquo;neutral,&rsquo; &lsquo;in
between,&rsquo; &lsquo;nepantla&rsquo;&rdquo; (149; emphasis added).
What this tells us is that <em>zozobra</em>&mdash;a term Uranga
inherits from the Mexican poet Ram&oacute;n Lop&eacute;z Velarde
(1888&ndash;1921), whose 1919 masterwork <em>Zozobra</em> serves as
inspiration&mdash;and <em>nepantla</em> are not identical or
interchangeable terms. <em>Zozobra</em> is the emotive expression of
nepantla; it is the <em>feeling</em> of uncertainty, unease, anxiety,
and despair that Uranga calls an &ldquo;estado de animo&rdquo; (a
&ldquo;mood&rdquo;&mdash;see Gallegos 2023).</p>

<p>
Finding oneself in this mood, or in the emotive state of
<em>zozobra</em>, is not unlike finding oneself overcome with
Kierkegaardian anxiety. Unlike Kierkegaardian anxiety, however,
zozobra names the specific feeling of sinking and drowning (a going
&ldquo;over and under&rdquo;), of being overwhelmed and undermined by
thoughts of the future; or, what&rsquo;s the same, it names the
feeling of being pulled to pieces by the many possibilities of
existence, none of which is presented as valuable or trustworthy.
Uranga&rsquo;s definition of <em>zozobra</em> highlights the
accompanying feeling of hopelessness: is a &ldquo;mode of being that
incessantly oscillates between two possibilities, between two affects,
without knowing on which of these to depend, on which of these to
cling to for justification&rdquo; (1952 [2021: 180]). In this way,
Mexican existentialism posits that <em>zozobra</em> manifests the
<em>nepantla</em> nature of Mexican identity, as unsettled, undefined,
and accidental, while also free (see also Villoro 1949: 242). But it
is a freedom that condemns us to a perpetual disquiet, feeling
ourselves standing without &ldquo;a fixed and solid ground&rdquo;
[<em>punto fijo y roque&ntilde;o</em>], or always on &ldquo;quicksand
on which nothing firm can stand&rdquo; (Uranga 1952 [2021: 181]).</p>

<h3 id="Relajo">2.5 Relajo</h3>

<p>
<em>Relajo</em> is a core concept in the existential philosophy of
Jorge Portilla (Hurtado 2006, 2023; S&aacute;nchez 2012, 2016, 2023;
Portilla 1966 [2012, 2023]). In a general sense, <em>relajo</em>
refers to an action or behavior that undermines prescribed or expected
attitudes toward established values (social, aesthetic, historical,
legal, and so on)<em>.</em> Portilla defines <em>relajo</em> as a
&ldquo;suspension of seriousness,&rdquo; which is equivalent, he says,
to saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to values. To say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to
values is to deny the demands of the social world itself. In normal
situations, I attend to the values of the world, saying
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; to them and doing as they demand&mdash;<em>I behave
appropriately</em>. Doing so maintains a social status quo and things
go on as they should. &ldquo;The mere grasping of the value carries
with it the fulfillment of that demand&hellip; [and its] realization
in the world; and in order for this demand&hellip;to be realized, the
subject, in turn, performs an act, a movement of loyalty [to the
value] that is a kind of &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rdquo; (Portilla 1966
[2012, 129]). <em>Relajo</em> is a non-normal response to those same
values. It is a rejection of their demands: &ldquo;[t]he sense of
<em>relajo</em> is precisely to frustrate the effectiveness of [a]
spontaneous response that accompanies the grasping of the value.
<em>Relajo</em> suspends seriousness; that is to say, it cancels the
normal response to the value, freeing me from the commitment to its
realization&rdquo; (129&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
The phenomenon of <em>relajo</em> involves the following three
movements, which happen simultaneously. The three are related to a
subject&rsquo;s relation to a proposed value(s): (i) the
<em>displacement of attention</em> away from what demands it, namely,
a value or set of values; (ii) a <em>dissolution of the relation</em>
between the subject and the value, or, Portilla says, a &ldquo;lack of
solidarity with the proposed value&rdquo; and it is not identical to
the displacement of attention; and (iii) a <em>disruptive gesture or
behavior</em>, or an &ldquo;action in the proper sense of the word
that consists of outward manifestations of gesture or word that
constitute an invitation to others to participate with me in this lack
of solidarity [with the value]&rdquo; (1966 [2012: 130]). Plainly put,
<em>relajo</em> suspends a subject&rsquo;s relation to value while
demanding the involvement of others in the disruptions or suspensions.
As a phenomenological fact, it reveals both the necessity of others
and the primacy of the relation I-you, since without others,
<em>relajo</em> is impossible.</p>

<h3 id="AprRel">2.6 Apretados and Relajientos</h3>

<p>
There are persons that appear to embody <em>relajo</em>. They are
called &ldquo;relajientos.&rdquo; <em>Relajientos</em> are unserious
persons who willfully suspend seriousness any chance they get.
<em>Relajientos</em> have mastered the art of initiating chaos,
displacing attention from what demands attention via actions or
behaviors that both interrupt and invite. <em>Relajientos</em> can be
anyone, but the primary characteristic of one is that in their
behavior they exhibit a lackadaisical attitude that quickly morphs
into a disdain of rules, authority, or customs. Their whole
personality manifests an incapacity, and unwillingness, to commit to
what society and others regard as valuable or worthy of commitment.
<em>Relajientos</em> seek to live fully in the now; the past has no
use for them and the future does not exist. Jorge Portilla says:
&ldquo;a <em>relajiento</em> is, literally, an individual without a
future. &hellip;he or she refuses to take anything seriously, to
commit to anything&hellip;assumes no responsibility for
anything&hellip;a good humor witness to the banality of life&rdquo;
(1966 [2012: 147]).</p>

<p>
At &ldquo;the absolute opposite pole&rdquo; of the <em>relajiento</em>
is the &ldquo;apretado.&rdquo; The <em>apretado</em>, a term we can
loosely translate as &ldquo;goody-two-shoes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;stick-in-the-mud,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;snobbish&rdquo; is not
just serious, but is <em>burdened with seriousness</em>. Colloquially
we say that they are &ldquo;tightly wound,&rdquo; zealous, fully
determined in and committed to their beliefs. We may even call them
fanatics (S&aacute;nchez 2024b). According to Portilla,
<em>apretados</em> are &ldquo;afflicted with the spirit of
seriousness&rdquo; (1966 [2012: 190]). This affliction shows up as a
commitment to <em>being</em> serious. Being serious set
<em>apretados</em> apart. Unlike <em>relajientos</em> who do as they
please, <em>apretados</em> do only what is demanded by their values.
Ultimately, <em>apretados</em> value order and obedience more than
freedom. One finds in this individual, Portilla writes, &ldquo;no
distance&hellip;between being and value&rdquo;&mdash;the <em>apreatado
is</em> what the <em>apratado</em> values, and this identity will be
reflected in how they represent themselves to others. How they portray
themselves is, moreover, is &ldquo;an expression of [their] internal
being&rdquo; (191). <em>Apretados</em> &ldquo;carry their value in the
same way that they carry with them their legs or their liver: as a
silent and solid cause of pleasure that they caress in their private
moments&rdquo; (191). They are, Portilla says, &ldquo;[c]ompact masses
of value.&rdquo; (191).</p>

<p>
Between the nihilism of the <em>relajiento</em> and the fanaticism of
the <em>apretado</em> there is a politically, morally, and
existentially preferable way to be. This middle ground will be the
personality type that respects societal values, obeys communal rules,
laws, and prohibitions, but is willing to question and challenge her
situation, changing her mind if necessary. This middle ground
personality will use irony and humor to her advantage as a means to
reveal the right way to be and the right way to go, and not as weapon
of disruption or suspension (she will not be a <em>relajiento</em>).
Moreover, she will identify with values, but will not become them, and
will always be willing to be rationally led to other, more enriching,
values and ways of being (she will not be an <em>apretado</em>).</p>

<h3 id="Dea">2.7 Death</h3>

<p>
Emilio Uranga contrasts a Mexican idea of death with the idea of death
of the Anglo-American or &ldquo;norteamericano&rdquo; (Uranga 1950).
For the Anglo-American, death is terrifying, something to be feared,
and avoid thinking about. This is because, for the Anglo-American,
when death comes, it takes <em>everything</em> away. For the Mexican,
on the other hand, death takes nothing away from you for the simple
reason that <em>in life</em> you never <em>truly</em> possessed
anything. So death is neither feared nor avoided; and thinking about
it is like thinking about any other of life&rsquo;s facts&mdash;it is
simply <em>there</em>. Uranga (1952 [2013]) puts it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
Death is not feared for the ends it brings nor because it impedes some
mission, which doesn&rsquo;t exist, nor is it feared for ripping away
a self that also does not exist. This is opposed to that extreme case,
the German, which is Heidegger&rsquo;s, in which death is imagined as
conferring upon life both individuality and totality. For the Spaniard
and for the North American death takes away something, while for the
German, it gives, but for the Mexican it neither gives nor takes
because there&rsquo;s nothing to take and there&rsquo;s nothing to
give (Uranga 1952 [2013]: 194).
</blockquote>

<p>
In <em>The Labyrinth of Solitude</em>, published in 1951, Octavio Paz
(1914&ndash;1998)&mdash;one of Mexico&rsquo;s literary icons and a
Nobel prize winner&mdash;echoes Uranga&rsquo;s sentiment: &ldquo;there
are two attitudes toward death: one, pointing forward, that conceives
of it as creation; the other, pointing backward, that expresses itself
as a fascination with nothingness or as a nostalgia for limbo&rdquo;
(1985: 61). Paz goes on to say that the forward-pointing attitude
belongs to the peoples of Europe and North America; the
backward-pointing attitude to the peoples of Mexico and Latin America.
We may call the forward-pointing attitude, the &ldquo;instrumental
attitude&rdquo;; the backward-pointing attitude may be referred to as
the &ldquo;historical attitude&rdquo;; the instrumental is
Anglo-European, the historical, Mexican (S&aacute;nchez 2013).</p>

<p>
To say that my attitude toward death is instrumental is to say that
death, my death and death in general, has instrumental value or is a
means to an end. The &ldquo;end&rdquo; is the vision, or ambition, I
have for my own life, and the &ldquo;means&rdquo; is the
<em>thought</em> that I&rsquo;m going to die. The thought of death is
what pushes me onward to the fulfillment of my goals. As such, death
is thought of as an always &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; as approaching,
always on the horizon and always a possibility. The instrumental
attitude is neatly described by Ernest Becker (1973) in <em>The Denial
of Death</em>: &ldquo;[T]he idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the
human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human
activity&mdash;activity designed largely to avoid the fatality of
death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final
destiny of man&rdquo; (xvii). This instrumental view of death is the
Western or North American attitude.</p>

<p>
Again, the Mexican attitude toward death, on the other hand, holds
that death has no such instrumental value but is merely a fact like
any other. As fact, it is not a &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; but an
&ldquo;always already,&rdquo; a constant presence or a coexistence.
This attitude is summarized by Uranga (1951 [2017]) when he writes:
&ldquo;Death is the only thing that the Mexican does not leave for
&lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;&rdquo; (193). In other words, our being is not
a &ldquo;being-toward-death,&rdquo; as Heidegger would say, but a
&ldquo;being-with-death&rdquo; in the now and not in the future. In
this way, Mexicans coexist with death as presence and fact. But
coexistence does not mean that death cannot surprise you; death, like
any <em>other</em>, can always catch you by surprise. Uranga says that
&ldquo;Constantly, Mexican lives [are] being ambushed by death&rdquo;
(167).</p>

<p>
According to Mexican existentialists, then, the fear of death is
removed with the thought that there&rsquo;s nothing that I have that
death wants. Our co-existence is not transactional, it is marked,
rather by togetherness and conviviality. We thus co-live with death in
acceptance. Uranga says, &ldquo;We exist on the edge of death. There
is in the life of the Mexican a permanent availability, or resolution,
to death&rdquo; (Uranga 2021: 511). Again, the focus is not on the
forthcomingness of death, on its future, although death is both here
and it can always kill me; the focus is, rather, on its presence, or
on its persistence in the present (Carrion 1951).</p>

<h3 id="MinThe">2.8 Minor Themes</h3>

<h4>2.8.1 Irony</h4>

<p>
Irony is a key existential concept for philosophers like Jorge
Portilla and Rosario Castellanos (1925&ndash;1974). Both of these
thinkers recognize irony&rsquo;s liberating function. For Castellanos,
irony is capable of interrogating the authority of dogmatic
(inherited) values, thus freeing us from them; and for Portilla, it
represents a critical stance, both against the dogmatism of the
apretado and the nihilism of the relajiento.</p>

<p>
Portilla considers irony as a mean, or middle ground, between the
excesses represented by apretados and relajientos. When related to
tradition, or inherited value systems, relajo shows up as a negation
of those values necessary to make sense of what is going on in the
present; in contrast, the fanaticism of the apretado insists that the
present only makes sense with, or can only be understood through,
inherited values. The first, the relajiento, rejects the call of
values, while the second, the apretado, embodies them. Irony, on the
other hand, holds itself at a distance from them and neither rejects
them nor accepts them. From a &ldquo;will to truth&rdquo; irony
demands the taking of a Socratic posture toward inherited values, one
in which a claim of ignorance allows the truth to come to light. Irony
opens the door to truth, a door relajo sees but does not open and
apretados see but nail shut. Portilla writes, &ldquo;Irony is a
liberation that founds a freedom for value&hellip;[while] relajo is a
negation that founds a pseudofreedom that is purely negative and thus
infertile&rdquo; (1966 [2012: 176]).</p>

<p>
Portilla&rsquo;s idea is that a wholesale demolition of the way things
stand (of &ldquo;values&rdquo;) does not lead to progress or truth or
freedom. Neither is a fanatical seriousness about inherited values,
which sticks one in place and traps one in the past&mdash;in a
different kind of unfreedom. What Portilla calls an &ldquo;ironic
consciousness&rdquo; is necessary to overcome both relajo and/or
fanaticism, since only an ironic consciousness can confront meaning
without destroying it. In the context of Portilla&rsquo;s
existentialism, irony is thereby the means whereby subjects create a
future without either blindly undermining tradition (via the
destructions relajo) or wholly internalizing it (via a dogmatic
acceptance or substantialization characteristic of the
apretadismo).</p>

<p>
Rosario Castellanos (2017) similarly proposes that inherited
values&mdash;this time in the form of patriarchal
relations&mdash;oppress and marginalize. In this case, only an ironic
attitude can liberate one (women, in particular) to a future freedom.
Reflecting on how women have been excluded from both literature and
philosophy, Castellanos ironically announces that such exclusion is
appropriate because women &ldquo;would be bored to death&rdquo; by
that sort of pursuit (2017). Castellanos&rsquo; ironic observation,
however, is refuted by her own literary and philosophical endeavors.
Her extensive bibliography attests to this. In saying that women would
be bored to do such work, moreover, she is calling attention to the
fact that this is the way that patriarchal narratives represent
women&rsquo;s attitudes towards learning and academic life. Irony is
here a key existential moment in the liberation of the oppressed in
general and women in particular (see Hierro 1997).</p>

<h4>2.8.2 Charity</h4>

<p>
Antonio Caso&rsquo;s <em>Existence as Economy and Charity</em>,
originally published in 1916, and republished in expanded form in 1919
as <em>Existence as Economy, as Disinterest, and as Charity</em>, can
be classified as a work in Christian existentialism. Influenced by the
work of Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Bergson, Caso proposes that human
existence in itself is pure egoism and selfishness, determined always
by its biological need for self-preservation. In acts of aesthetic
disinterest and Christian love, a person frees itself from its
biological prison by doing what does not contribute to its immediate
survival. A text written decades before the arrival of French and
German existentialism to Mexico, the goal of Caso&rsquo;s work is
ultimately to persuade its reader that authentic human life is lived
in service to others. He calls this &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; and
believes that if anything distinguishes the human from the beast, it
is their ability to &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; their own self-interests
for the interests of their fellows.</p>

<p>
Caso identifies three possible forms of existence: existence as
economy, existence as disinterest, and existence as charity. Regarding
the first: Caso&rsquo;s existentialism is situated in the context of
Mexico&rsquo;s anti-positivist movement of the first decades of the
20<sup>th</sup> century. In fact, Caso&rsquo;s early texts responds to
the positivism of August Comte, Herbert Spencer and the Social
Darwinism popularized in Mexico toward the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century. According to that tradition, existence is nothing but a
&ldquo;struggle for life,&rdquo; that is, a struggle for survival and
the continuation of the species&mdash;this is existence as mere
transaction, power, or economy. All that the person does, in this
case, is for self-benefit. This is the height of egoism: all
accumulation and all excess of vital energy, material wealth, power
and so on is re-invested in oneself or accumulated for one&rsquo;s
profit. Other selves are there <em>for me</em> and for <em>my</em>
needs<em>.</em> The formula for this way of existing is this:
&ldquo;life=maximum benefit + minimum effort.&rdquo; According to
Caso, existence as economy is the <em>most</em> rational way to
life.</p>

<p>
Existence as disinterest and existence as charity are irrational ways
to live. To live life as disinterest is to invest all excess vital
energy not on the ego, but in things that have nothing to do with
biology, such as art or the contemplation of beauty. This form of
existence is not interested in the triumphs of the ego, or even
survival. Living charitably takes this one step further: it is to
sacrifice resources (what he calls &ldquo;life energy&rdquo;) that
would otherwise benefit a subject&rsquo;s own preservation and to do
so for the sake of others. Reason is adamantly opposed to this. Reason
says that any excess resources (or &ldquo;energy&rdquo;) that a
subject may possess should be spent on that which may guarantee
survival or reproduction. It is irrational to spend energy excesses in
any other way. The formula for this way of existence:
&ldquo;sacrifice=maximum effort +minimum gain.&rdquo; A charitable
existence, that is, is one lived <em>for others</em>, in service of
one&rsquo;s neighbor, while doing the most with what one has and
investing of oneself without expecting a return on that investment.
Ultimately, it is the individual who sacrifices for others, who spends
his excess energy, his surplus, on the well-being of others that has
surpassed the tyranny of the self and is truly charitable.</p>

<p>
Freedom is intimately involved in the choice between living life as
economy, as disinterest, or as charity. One can chose to live life as
economy and never care about others, about art, or about the world.
But &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; itself depends on choosing charity over
economy: &ldquo;a good man sacrifices egoism in favor of helping his
fellow man, and such a sacrifice is free.&rdquo; (Caso 2017: 38). But,
again, charity is irrational; no rational calculus can conclude that
giving away what one has is good for the self. So existence as charity
is both a free act and an irrational choice, since reason is
fundamentally egoist. &ldquo;Life says: do not give what is your own.
Reason says: to give is foolish. The good says: give what your egoism
asks you to hold on to because reason does not discover your true,
deep self, your real, autonomous personality emancipated from
biological life&rdquo; (Caso 1986: 51). Charity is thus a category of
existence to which person ought to aspire if they wish to be good. The
moral imperative attached to this aspiration is simple: &ldquo;Go,
commit acts of charity!&rdquo; (Caso 2017: 45).</p>

<h4>2.8.3 Fragility, Melancholy, and Unwillingness</h4>

<p>
Emilio Uranga defines human fragility as &ldquo;the quality of always
being threatened by nothingness, by the threat of falling into
non-being&rdquo; (1951 [2017: 167]). Fragility is an
&ldquo;ontological condition&rdquo; like insufficiency that defines
the &ldquo;being of Mexican being.&rdquo; For Mexicans (or so say the
Mexican existentialists), this fragility is manifested as
&ldquo;melancholy&rdquo; and &ldquo;unwillingness&rdquo;
(<em>desgana</em>). Importantly, melancholy is more fundamental than
either fragility and unwillingness, as it exposes us as beings without
ground and without reason for being (Ram&iacute;rez 2022: 53).
Unwillingness differs from melancholy in that it is a response to it;
it does not refer to a <em>lack of will</em>, but to a <em>willingness
to refuse</em> to exercise it because <em>there is no point</em> in
doing so. Said differently, it is not that one lacks the will to do X,
but that one refuses to do X for some reason, including
&ldquo;repulsion,&rdquo; &ldquo;disgust,&rdquo; or
procrastination&mdash;&ldquo;leaving everything for
&lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;&rdquo; (Uranga 1951 [2017: 167]). One sees the
world as disgusting, for example, when participating in its rituals
bring me closer to something that I hate or with which I don&rsquo;t
want to associate. &ldquo;Unwillingness is precisely the disgust that
overtakes us when we foresee that our action might contribute to a
consolidation of the abject sense of things. All action is therefore
valued, in unwillingness, within the horizon of its contribution to
depravity and corruption&rdquo; (168). Uranga&rsquo;s notion of
unwillingness could be interpreted as laziness, which the term seems
to imply; but unwillingness here is thought to be imbued with power.
It is a form of resistance to <em>not</em> participate in the world.
The unwilling man, writes Uranga, &ldquo;sees a meaningful process
that beckons his collaboration, his decision, his action, and that
demands to be fulfilled by a <em>surplus</em> of determination&rdquo;
(167); in spite of this call, however, or against it, the unwilling
person refuses to act, or <em>chooses not to choose</em>.
Unwillingness is an intentional indifference having less to do with
incapacity or inability and more to do with power, or resistance.
However, for the Mexican existentialists, the downside of
unwillingness is that the unwilling lose out on the opportunity to be
historical, to impact the world. On the other hand, the willing (or
the &ldquo;generous&rdquo;) make &ldquo;a determined choice to
collaborate, a will to sympathize, to enter into auxiliary contact
with things, with history, with social movements, of adding or
synthesizing the capacity for teleological determination that emanates
from freedom with the causality that weighs things down, with the
dialectical course of the world that straightens itself toward a goal
but which without that <em>surplus</em> of determination can degrade
or minimize itself into inadequate compromises&rdquo; (167). Mexican
existentialists point to unwillingness so that it may be avoided. It
should be avoided because nothing changes if one is unwilling to
&ldquo;collaborate.&rdquo; And if nothing changes, everything stays
the same, including whatever oppressive conditions one may be
presently enduring.</p>

<h2 id="CriMexExi">3. Critiques of Mexican Existentialism</h2>

<p>
Critiques for Mexican existentialism abound and vary from rigorous
critique of methodology (Gaos 1952 and Villegas 1979) to dismissal on
political or other-than-philosophical grounds (Bartra 1987 and Santos
Ruiz 2015). While Gaos himself helps articulate the Mexican
existentialist project with his mentorship and courses on Heidegger
and others, he&rsquo;s also one of the first to critique their
approach on the basis that the Mexican being to which the philosophers
refer <em>does not exist</em>, calling their method
&ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; (Gaos 1952). Villegas likewise criticizes the
method, observing that Mexican existentialist confuse history for
being, historicism for ontology (Villegas 1979). Other critics simply
propose that the Mexican existentialists didn&rsquo;t understand
existentialism (D&iacute;az 2024).</p>

<p>
There were more dismissive critiques. One of Mexico&rsquo;s most
important and influential philosophers, Jos&eacute; Vasconcelos, was
an early, and vociferous, critic of the Mexican existentialist
movement. In interviews given in 1950, Vasconcelos laments that
existentialism in Mexico &ldquo;is as sterile as the nothingness from
which it takes its point of departure&rdquo; (1950). The crux of his
critique is that existentialism doesn&rsquo;t really introduce
anything new or interesting to either philosophy or culture:
&ldquo;the method is simplistic, almost infantile and its conclusions
obvious&rdquo; (1950). The obvious conclusions of existentialism (that
man is free, that God does not exist, that one is thrown into the
world) don&rsquo;t inspire purpose or the sort of commitment that Zea,
Uranga, and the rest, believe that they inspire. What it inspires,
instead, is the abandonment of those ideals that make life worth
living&mdash;another way to say that existentialism breeds
unwillingness. And without ideals, man is lost.
&ldquo;Existentialism,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the terminus of a
decadence that in philosophy begins when thought lacks God and turns
to itself&rdquo; (1950). Such egoism is at the heart of existentialism
and, Vasconcelos hopes, Mexican existentialist realize this sooner
rather than later.</p>

<p>
A few decades after Vasconcelos, the Mexican cultural critic Roger
Bartra dismisses the Mexican existentialist project on political
grounds. In <em>The Cage of Melancholy</em> (1987), Bartra suggests
that as its apex, during the moment of <em>la filosof&iacute;a de lo
mexicano</em>, Mexican existentialism was ultimately rooted in
&ldquo;the disdain of the dominant classes for the lives of those who
find themselves in conditions of misery&rdquo; (60). In other words,
the existential analysis that found Mexicans as accidental,
indifferent to death, relajientos, or insufficient was political and
ideological and was meant to justify existing social conditions
(unequal and oppressive as they were). Existentialism, Bartra says,
was an expression of a &ldquo;nationalist romanticism&rdquo; that
sought to &ldquo;generate a tragic sense of the opposition between the
barbarian and the civilized man, and to create for modern man a
mythical past, so that his very modernity could, apparently, shed such
myths and confront rationally the construction of the future&rdquo;
(53).</p>

<p>
Similarly, Ana Santos Ruiz&rsquo;s <em>Los Hijos de los dioses: El
Grupo filos&oacute;fico Hiperi&oacute;n y la filosof&iacute;a de lo
mexicano</em> reaffirms Bartra&rsquo;s suspicion that Mexican
existentialism was not philosophy at all, but a form of state
ideology. According to Santos Ruiz, Mexican existentialism sought to
essentialize Mexican identity through various mechanism and
strategies, thus solidifying and authenticating that identity as an
accomplished, historical, fact. Santos Ruiz thus connects the
<em>philosophical</em> project of autognosis, of knowing who and what
the Mexican was, with a broader political project:</p>

<blockquote>
The <em>filosof&iacute;a de lo mexicano</em>, for its part, created a
discourse that sought to erase ethnic, cultural, social, political,
and economic differences so as to offer a unique project of nation
building based on an identity equally unique that, in turn, rested in
<em>one</em> character, <em>one</em> history, and <em>one</em> shared
culture (Ruiz 2015: 325).
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, the subject of Mexican existentialism&mdash;the person
that takes responsibility, that commits, that exists in nepantla, that
suffers relajo, that deploys irony, and so on&mdash;is itself abstract
and ideal. Mexican existentialism does not account, according to this
critique, for the multiple identities and ethnicities that make up the
historical and social space which is Mexico. This is a fair critique
and much more can be said about it as well as other critiques levelled
against the tradition (Pereda 2006).</p>

<h2 id="CurSch">4. Current Scholarship</h2>

<p>
Mexican existentialism is currently in a state of recovery. In Mexico,
the recovery process begins in earnest at the turn of the present
century with Guillermo Hurtado&rsquo;s edited volume <em>El</em>
<em>Hiperi&oacute;n</em> (2006), which brings together the most
significant figures of this movement as well as fragments of their
best-known writings. This is followed by Jaime Vieyra&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Emilio Uranga: la existencia como accidente&rdquo; (2007) and
Guillermo Hurtado&rsquo;s edition of Emilio Uranga&rsquo;s master
work, <em>An&aacute;lisis del ser del mexicano</em> together with
various other of Uranga&rsquo;s writings (1952 [2013]). Most recently,
works by Hurtado, Aurelia Valero, Jos&eacute; Manuel Cu&eacute;llar,
Mario Teodoro Ram&iacute;rez, Jaime Vieyra, and Hector Aparicio offer
contemporary interpretations of existential writings of Portilla,
Uranga, Villoro, and Zea (Hurtado 2019; Pie 2012; Cu&eacute;llar 2020;
Ram&iacute;rez 2022; Aparicio 2023; Garcia Torres 2024). The Mexican
project of recovery continues and it is sure continue well into the
21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<p>
In the US, this project of recovery is simultaneously a project of
discovery. It involves a synergistic approach to Mexican philosophy
involving translation, interpretation, publication and teaching. These
efforts include Carlos Alberto Sanch&eacute;z&rsquo;s introduction and
translation of Jorge Portilla&rsquo;s <em>La fenomenolog&iacute;a del
relajo</em> (1966 [2012, 2023]) and <em>Emilio Uranga&rsquo;s</em>
<em>Analysis of Mexican Being</em> (1952 [2021]), as well as
S&aacute;nchez&rsquo;s <em>Contingency and Commitment: Mexican
Existentialism and the Place of Philosophy</em> (2016). These works
begin a conversation of Mexican existentialism, it&rsquo;s breadth,
scope, and also its blind-spots&mdash;Andrea Pitts (2016), for
instance, points out the complete lack of the feminist perspective
internal to this project. The project is spurned on by the editorial
work of Robert Eli Sanchez and Carlos Alberto S&aacute;nchez, who
publish <em>Mexican Philosophy in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century:
Essential Readings</em> in 2017 and launch the <em>Journal of Mexican
Philosophy</em> a few years later in 2022. More recent scholarship
seeks to engage Mexican existentialism with a less historical, more
analytical, approach. Stephanie Merrim&rsquo;s <em>A Latin American
Existentialist Ethos</em> (2023) zeroes in on the influence of Mexican
existentialism on literary figures of the time, including Juan Rulfo
and Rosario Castellanos; Sergio Gallegos-Ordonica engages
Uranga&rsquo;s humanism (2020); Manuel Vargas offers an analysis and
interpretation of &ldquo;accidentality&rdquo; (2020); Juan Carlos
Gonzalez (2024) thinks of Mexican existentialism in relation to the
various crises plaguing &ldquo;America&rdquo; in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century; Francisco Gallegos gives us a contemporary reading of the
phenomenology of zozobra (2023); and Juan Garcia Torres (2023) brings
these Mexican existentialists into conversation with the popular
decolonial approaches. It is thus safe to say that Mexican
existentialism is a not merely a historical artifact, but a living,
breathing philosophical archive with much to offer contemporary
scholars.</p>
