<h1>Edith Landmann-Kalischer</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Mar 18, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Edith Landmann-Kalischer (1877&ndash;1951) is the author of several
significant studies on topics in the philosophy of art, aesthetics,
value, mind, and knowledge in the first half of the twentieth century.
Influenced by Franz Brentano, Georg Simmel, Carl Stumpf, and Stefan
George, her studies were initiated at a time when the academic, often
tendentious borders between psychology and philosophy, like those
between aesthetics and art history, were still being drawn. While
clearly also influenced by Edmund Husserl, she takes his phenomenology
to task for its idealism and, in her view, its unfounded isolation
from the sciences, especially psychology. Although neglected in
subsequent years until very recently, her work in aesthetics and value
theory and her numerous critical reviews were widely respected by her
contemporaries, such as Max Dessoir and Alexius Meinong. So, too,
students of Stefan George and his circle have long been indebted to
her chronicles and studies of the poet. Following a review of her
life, work, and influences, the present entry focuses principally on
her contributions, early and late, to aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="LifWorInf">1. Life, Work, and Influences</h2>

<p>
Born in Berlin in 1877, Landmann-Kalischer received her PhD in 1901
with a dissertation from the University of Zurich under the direction
of Ernst Meumann on the &ldquo;Analysis of Aesthetic Contemplation
(Painting and Sculpture)&rdquo;, based upon a combination of
self-observation and art history (since, as she puts it, the subject
matter exceeded the experiences of a single consciousness). During her
graduate studies she took advantage of an arrangement that allowed her
to attend lectures by Simmel and Stumpf in Berlin, to whom&mdash;along
with Meumann&mdash;she pays special tribute in the dissertation. By
her own account, &ldquo;philosophy, specifically psychology, and art
history&rdquo; were her main scholarly interests and this description
captures her own interdisciplinary approach to these subjects as well
as the interwovenness of philosophy and psychology at this time. Two
years after submitting her dissertation she married&nbsp;Julius
Landmann, a Swiss economist, and over the next seven years she gave
birth to three children. She and her children
accompanied&nbsp;Landmann as he worked, first in Bern
(1906&ndash;1910) for the Swiss National Bank, and then as he took up
academic positions at the University of Basel (1910&ndash;1927) and at
the University of Kiel (1927&ndash;1931).</p>

<p>
During the first decade of the century, Landmann-Kalischer writes two
important essays on topics in aesthetics: &ldquo;On the Cognitive
Value of Aesthetic Judgments&rdquo; (1905a) and &ldquo;On Artistic
Truth&rdquo; (1906), followed by the monograph <em>Philosophy of
Values</em> (1910) which she prefaces with a critical review of Hugo
von M&uuml;nsterberg&rsquo;s own 1908 <em>Philosophy of Values</em>.
The first two essays are reviewed respectively in sections 2 and 3
below as part of the entry&rsquo;s emphasis on
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s contributions to aesthetics. However, her
contributions to axiology are also noteworthy, as evidenced by her
<em>Philosophy of Values</em>.</p>

<p>
In the 1910 monograph she begins with a review of
M&uuml;nsterberg&rsquo;s appeal to a world-affirming,
&ldquo;supra-personal&rdquo; act of will&mdash;supposedly shared by
all humans and ensuring coherence across human experience&mdash;as the
source of value in general. Landmann-Kalischer dismisses this appeal
as nothing more than an &ldquo;arbitrary metaphysical
assumption&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 121). She also reviews
M&uuml;nsterberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;doctrine of four worlds&rdquo;, i.e.,
the four autonomous domains of logical, aesthetic, ethical, and
religious value, demonstrating how the doctrine departs from
Windelband&rsquo;s Neo-Kantian system of values. But she also contests
M&uuml;nsterberg&rsquo;s Kant-inspired appeal to a principle of
constitution to justify value-judgments&rsquo; claims of validity. On
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s reading, M&uuml;nsterberg mistakenly
supposes that, just as logical judgments&rsquo; validity is based upon
the fact that they constitute the world, &ldquo;it must be possible to
legitimize the good, the beautiful, and the holy in the same
way&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 118). By demonstrating the illegitimacy of
this approach to the philosophy of value, Landmann-Kalischer sets the
stage for her own approach. Rejecting the Kantian-styled project of
locating &ldquo;values in the construction of the world that the
rationalist epistemology projects&rdquo;, Landmann-Kalischer turns to
the given, to values as we find them, namely, as the properties of
things that we deem valuable &ldquo;on the basis of an immediate
feeling that they arouse in us&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 143). In her
view&mdash;building on her 1905a essay discussed in the section 2
below&mdash;we objectify feelings (&lsquo;<em>x</em> is
beautiful&rsquo;) just as we objectify sensations (&lsquo;<em>x</em>
is red&rsquo;) and with the same degree of legitimacy. Her elaboration
of this view requires a differentiation of feelings from emotions; the
former can be &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo;,
while the latter never are. With this reference to disinterestedness,
the paradigmatic inspiration that Landmann-Kalischer draws from
Kant&rsquo;s analysis of aesthetic experience is apparent. But the
immediate context is ongoing discussion in contemporary philosophy of
mind about the status of feelings and emotions&mdash;for example, in
the works of Stumpf and Alexis Meinong, among others&mdash;to which
she contributes.</p>

<p>
Mention has already been made of Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s engagement
with the work of philosophers like Simmel, Stumpf, and Windelband. But
the reach of her research extends to several other prominent peers and
immediate predecessors as well. Her correspondence, for example, with
Alexius Meinong on the status of value is substantial, apparently
prompting a change of mind on his part. Citing both &ldquo;On the
Cognitive Value of Aesthetic Judgments&rdquo; and <em>Philosophy of
Value</em>, he writes that, contrary to his first impressions,
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s explanations seem to him today &ldquo;the
most important&rdquo; for the establishment of the conception he is
sketching (Meinong 1912: 10; although the degree of
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s grasp of Meinong&rsquo;s early
value-theoretic views is disputed; see Reicher 2009: 116n8). Also
worthy of note in this connection are Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s
critical reviews of works by such prominent scholars as Theodor Lipps
and Emil Lask. Her work in epistemology (see below) is replete with
references to the work of Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm Dilthey, whom
she credits with demonstrating that we can know, not only the
universal, but the individual; yet she rejects the notion that
knowledge of the latter is reserved for the humanities (<em>TE</em>
250&ndash;256, 277).</p>

<p>
Another major influence on Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s thinking is, as
already noted, Edmund Husserl. She touts his exposition of the object
of consciousness, building on studies by Bolzano and Brentano, as
&ldquo;the most encompassing and most emphatic&rdquo; (<em>TE</em>
25). She leans on Husserl&rsquo;s doctrine of fulfillment and,
importantly, its limitations to craft her own view of the
transcendence of knowing (<em>TE</em> 31, 34, 36, 91). More decisively
than anyone else, he recognizes &ldquo;seeing as the ultimate ground
of all rational claims and perfect clarity as the measure of all
truth&rdquo; (<em>TE</em> 284). Still, she laments the fact that
Husserl&mdash;&ldquo;the very same scholar whom we have to thank above
all for reestablishing transcendence as a fact of
consciousness&rdquo;&mdash;vehemently opposes any realistic,
epistemological interpretation of transcendence (<em>TE</em> 47). She
takes particular exception to Husserl&rsquo;s insistence that an abyss
separates consciousness and reality (<em>TE</em> 49). By stressing
that transcendence can be attributed to objects of consciousness
whether or not there is something transcendent, he shows that he does
not take it [the transcendence of consciousness]
&ldquo;seriously&rdquo; (<em>TE</em> 57). Both Husserl&rsquo;s
phenomenology and Cassirer&rsquo;s Kantianism show their common
modern, idealist stripes by taking knowing&mdash;not being&mdash;as
primitive (<em>TE</em> 73).</p>

<p>
As noted, Husserl&rsquo;s influence on Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s
thinking is substantial in the ways that she appropriates his
phenomenology as well as the ways that she distances herself from it.
The same might be said for Franz Brentano&rsquo;s arguably even more
telling influence on her thinking. Brentano&rsquo;s importance for her
work is twofold: first, she regards him as the foremost advocate for
the objective conception of values which she herself embraces
(<em>Essays</em> 4) and second, in her view, it is &ldquo;thanks to
Brentano and since Brentano&rdquo; that the latest research has become
familiar once again with the phenomenon of intentionality (<em>TE</em>
8, 25). But she also develops her own philosophical position by
setting it against Brentano&rsquo;s approach in at least two respects.
Brentano develops what is today deemed a
&ldquo;dispositionalist&rdquo; approach where value is a quality of a
higher order, dually dependent (like secondary qualities) on the
subject as well as the properties of things.
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s philosophy of value aligns with this
dispositionalist approach, save in one crucial respect: she locates
that disposition in feelings not desires (see Vendrell-Ferrarin 2014:
151&ndash;152). She shares with Brentano the notion that the ensuing
judgments can be objective but she rejects Brentano&rsquo;s appeal to
a supposedly immediately evident judgment in this connection (akin to
a judgment like the principle of noncontradiction that is clearly
differentiable from a blind judgment); she rejects this appeal to
intuition in favor of empirical experience and the work of identifying
and removing errors. &ldquo;Thus, Landmann-Kalischer understands the
objectivity of sensory judgments and value-judgments not as a fact but
as a task, &hellip;&rdquo; (Vendrell-Ferrarin 2014: 153) or, as
Landmann-Kalischer herself puts it, &ldquo;The objectively valid
values are not given, but have to be won&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 163).
On a more general, logical level, she rejects Brentano&rsquo;s
contention that axioms are &ldquo;immediately true&rdquo;, rejecting
it because (a) judgments of outer perception are subjectively no less
evident than those of inner perception and (b) the subjective evidence
of judgments derived from the axioms is the same as that of the axioms
themselves (<em>Essays</em> 177&ndash;181; on the influence of
Brentano&rsquo;s method and descriptive psychology on
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s thinking in general, see Matherne 2023:
249&ndash;256 and Matherne&rsquo;s Introduction to <em>Essays</em>
xxvii&ndash;xxxii [Matherne 2024a]).</p>

<p>
As a 22-year-old student, Landmann-Kalischer attended a seminar led by
Max Dessoir at which Stefan George read his poetry (Karlauf 2007:
194). She later (1908) made the acquaintance of the poet who became an
annual summer guest of the family in Basel from 1913 to 1927. During
this time Landmann-Kalischer became a devoted, even ardent follower of
the poet, keeping a regular diary of their conversations, later
published as <em>Gespr&auml;che mit Stefan George</em> (Conversations
with Stefan George); on her involvement in the <em>George-Kreis</em>
(the circle of George&rsquo;s admirers), see Raulff 2009:
139&ndash;157. Based upon a manuscript written to honor the poet on
his 50<sup>th</sup> birthday in 1918, she publishes anonymously
<em>Georgika: Das Wesen des Dichters</em> (Georgika: The Essence of
the Poet) in 1920, followed by a reviewed&nbsp;edition in 1924. In
1923 she completed &ldquo;Carl Spitteler&rsquo;s Poetic Mission
[<em>Sendung</em>]&rdquo;, a study of the Nobel Prize-winning Swiss
poet. Two further works on George would be published posthumously:
<em>Georges Wiedererweckung der Griechen</em> (George&rsquo;s
Reawakening of the Greeks) (1955) and <em>Stefan George und die
Griechen. Idee einer neuen Ethik</em> (Stefan George and the Greeks:
Idea of a New Ethics) (1971).</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s work in the early part of the century was
by no means confined to aesthetics, axiology, and poetology. By 1916
she completed the first draft of a major work in epistemology:
<em>Transcendenz des Erkennens</em> (<em>Transcendence of
Knowing</em>); the published version appears in 1923. This work
presents a robust review of the different forms of transcendence,
intra-mental and extra-mental transcendence, i.e., transcendence
within consciousness and transcendence of something independent of
consciousness, respectively. The review culminates in a potent defense
of what she deems &ldquo;transcendent realism&rdquo; and &ldquo;a
realist epistemology&rdquo;. The existence of the external world is,
she submits, the <em>Urph&auml;nomen</em>, providing the very sense of
consciousness. The notion of a subject not transcending itself is pure
fiction, even though the intention of the existing, extra-mental
object is &ldquo;essentially unfulfillable&rdquo; (<em>TE</em> 24,
31). Although we cannot help but represent [<em>vorstellen</em>]
objects,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
still we represent each object as unrepresented&hellip;The fact that
the transcendent objects inevitably appear transcendent only to a
consciousness cannot cancel the other fact that every consciousness
attests to its transcendence. (<em>TE</em> 46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These ruminations, it bears noting, echo unmistakably in
Heidegger&rsquo;s subsequent account of being-in-the-world, entailing
the &ldquo;transcendence&rdquo; of Dasein that underlies its concerns
and dealings, whether theoretical or practical, amidst innerworldly
beings (Heidegger <em>SZ</em> 364). This echo is perhaps to be
expected, given their common repudiation of Husserl&rsquo;s idealism,
and Landmann-Kalischer seems to have recognized as much (<em>Wissen
und Werten</em> [Landmann 1930: 98]; Riedner 2002: 3).</p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, Landmann-Kalischer takes both idealists and
positivists to task, criticizing the former for countenancing only the
contents of consciousness and the latter for countenancing only
appearances&mdash;as though those contents and those appearances do
not point to transcendent objects (<em>TE</em> 65f). In this very
connection the Jesuit Scholastic philosopher, Erich Przywara, sees
<em>Transcendenz des Erkennens</em>, with its insistence that
transcendence is the <em>a priori</em> of knowing, as a departure from
Kant and a return to a Scholastic position, albeit with the profile of
the <em>George-Kreis</em> (Przywara 1924: 65). Korinna Sch&ouml;nharl
similarly reads <em>Transcendenz des Erkennens</em> as the singular,
unified presentation of the &ldquo;epistemological intuitions&rdquo;
of the <em>George-Kreis</em> and concludes by noting the work&rsquo;s
influence on the economist Edgar Salin (Sch&ouml;nharl 2009:
446&ndash;448, 465, 471&ndash;475). Landmann-Kalischer herself
acknowledges the influence of conversations with the poet on the work
(Landmann 1963: 15). Indeed, drawing on aesthetics to make an
epistemological point, she emphasizes the following analogy between
the object of a painting and the object of consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as the means of the presentation [<em>Darstellung</em>] and its
object are at once in the painting, so consciousness of the object and
the transcendent object are at once in our knowledge. (<em>TE</em>
70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The analogy holds, moreover, whether or not the object is the pure
product of phantasy or a faithful imitation of something actual. So,
too, the knowledge like the painting is only one of many means of
portraying the object, each varying in its accuracy and what it
accentuates.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We may believe again in what we see and how we see it: knowledge is a
picture [<em>Bild</em>]. In the copy [<em>Abbild</em>] it shows us the
original [<em>Urbild</em>]. (<em>TE</em> 71)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s life is marked by tragedy on a personal
level, particularly in the decade immediately following the
publication of <em>Transcendenz des Erkennens</em>. In 1925 her
daughter dies as a teenager from a rare form of tuberculosis, her
husband commits suicide in 1931. Whether or not she suffered from not
having her love for George requited, she experienced rejection by the
<em>George-Kreis</em> that was clearly motivated in her mind by the
mounting anti-semitism in Germany. At this point the personal and
political tragedies of her life begin to merge. When she protested
George&rsquo;s sympathy for a movement that treated Jews with the
brutality that National Socialism did, she reported&nbsp;him replying
dismissively: &ldquo;When I think of what Germany faces in the next
fifty years, this whole Jewish thing in particular is not so important
to me&rdquo; (Norton 2002: 726; Karlauf 2007: 604f). As
Landmann-Kalischer finally realized that it was impossible for Jews to
remain in Germany, she dreamt of a Jewish ghetto in Namibia, before
finally coming around to appreciate the approach of Zionists.</p>

<p>
After Hitler came to power, Landmann-Kalischer spent most of the 1930s
in Basel, befriending the painter Gertrud Kantorowicz and living with
the philologist Renata von Scheliha (until the latter&rsquo;s
emigration to the United States in 1948). During this time she gave
lectures at the <em>Volkshochschule</em> in Basel and explored various
interpretations of the classics. But she also returned to central
themes in aesthetics, completing&nbsp;<em>Grundz&uuml;ge einer Lehre
vom Sch&ouml;nen</em> (Fundamentals of a Doctrine of the Beautiful) in
1940, which was available in hectograph copies until its posthumous
publication&nbsp;as <em>Die Lehre vom Sch&ouml;nen</em> (The Doctrine
of the Beautiful) in 1952 (Schuster, 35). Following a short visit to
von Scheliha in 1951, Landmann-Kalischer died of complications from an
operation.</p>

<h2 id="CogValAesJud">2. The Cognitive Value of Aesthetic Judgments</h2>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer opens her 1905a essay on the cognitive value of
aesthetic judgments by posing two leading questions, to be treated
separately: (1) &ldquo;whether the aesthetic judgment is a cognitive
judgment&rdquo; (in Kant&rsquo;s sense, something Kant denies) and (2)
&ldquo;whether and to what extent aesthetic judgments can be credited
with trans-subjective validity&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 4). Her
strategy to answer these questions is to elaborate analogies between
sensory judgments and value judgments. These analogies demonstrate
three theses: (i) that aesthetic valuation is the work of an
&ldquo;organ&rdquo; functioning similarly to sense organs, (ii) that
aesthetic judgment is on a par with sensory judgments in terms of
their objective validity, and (iii) that beauty is a property of
things in the same sense as sensory qualities are. Championing these
theses, she notes, runs against the grain of most contemporary views
of values, Brentano being the lone exception (as noted above). She
runs through a list of proponents of the subjectivist view of values,
who affirm that values are neither the properties of things nor the
objects of cognitive judgments. She also notes the divergence among
these proponents regarding the separate question of the objective
validity of aesthetic judgments, their so-called &ldquo;mandate&rdquo;
character, and how it connects with their subjectivist positions on
values. &ldquo;One looks in vain in the case of one author as in that
of another,&rdquo; she submits,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for a principled stance toward the question of the extent and the
degree to which value judgments can be true and false and can
accordingly mandate [<em>fordern</em>] our acknowledgment or
rejection. (<em>Essays</em> 7; translation slightly revised)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If, without denying the subjectively conditioned character of values,
one could show that value judgments are on a par with sensory
judgments and their trans-subjective validity, &ldquo;this explanation
would have the advantage over the others of simplifying instead of
complicating the picture of the world&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 8). With
this statement, Landmann-Kalischer introduces the project of the
essay.</p>

<p>
The first step in making her case is to establish the basic connection
of values to feelings as opposed to desires (the will) or to an ideal
(norm) of the subject. If anything, desires presuppose feelings and
immediate value judgments are quite independent of an ideal (which is,
in any case, itself already a value, thereby forfeiting any claim that
it is what forms values). Having dismissed these two views of value,
Landmann-Kalischer concludes that, &ldquo;along with the majority of
psychologists&rdquo;, its content is to be seen in its connection to
feeling. Here the paradigm is Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;pure, disinterested
judgment of taste&rdquo;, based upon the connection of an object to
the subject&rsquo;s feeling of pleasure and displeasure (accordingly,
the only values under consideration here are primary, unmediated
values; excluded are economic and utilitarian values which alike
presuppose other values.)</p>

<p>
Having established the fundamental connection between values and
feelings (a strategy already pursued by Brentano), Landmann-Kalischer
probes whether this connection entails that value judgments are not
really cognitive judgments, i.e., judgments designating a property of
the object. Underlying the supposition of their non-cognitive status,
Landmann-Kalischer points out, is the view that feelings are a purely
subjective element, referring only to one&rsquo;s own being (in
contrast to sensations that relate to external objects). Throwing down
the gauntlet at such views (and anticipating similar points made by
Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty), Landmann-Kalischer asserts: &ldquo;In my
view, it is time to become skeptical of such purely subjective
elements of consciousness&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 13). Both
phenomenologists reject the notion that sensations can be isolated
from their worldly context or gestalt or that they are purely internal
and, in that sense, purely subjective.</p>

<p>
Pressing the point, she asks: Isn&rsquo;t the separation of
things&rsquo; sensory qualities from the feelings they elicit as
incoherent as the separation of their primary qualities from their
secondary qualities? Why should being red count as a property of a
thing but being beautiful does not? Some would argue that the
variability of feeling is one reason why. But Landmann-Kalischer
counters that this sort of variability is also found in sensations and
representations. Moreover, despite the variability and distortions, we
have come to accept the law-governed dependency of some sensations on
the object as well as the possibility of objective cognition through
them. Hence, it would be arbitrary to rule out a similar prospect for
feelings. To be sure, Landmann-Kalischer adds, in both cases, that of
sensations as well as feelings, a distinction between subjective and
objective conditions holds.</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer concedes that science traditionally purges
cognizing of feelings both (a) because they did not enter into
consideration for determining causes and (b) because animists and
their kin often misread them into nature. Yet, in regard to (a),
something similar holds for sensations. Thus,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for mechanics, the color of things is as irrelevant as thermal
qualities are for optics. So, too, for the consideration of the
anatomy of a flower, its aesthetic value is no less immaterial than
its color. (<em>Essays</em> 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As for (b), cognition through feeling has little to do with this
importation of feelings into things (which is itself a kind of
philosophical or religious thesis). Someone might also object that the
sensory properties of things play a fundamental role in the conceptual
cognition of them, i.e., that color and touch aid us in recognizing
things in ways that beauty does not. But, Landmann-Kalischer counters,
while a color may aid in recognizing things, it is frequently set
aside in the formation of concepts, whereas a thing&rsquo;s value,
while perhaps not much help in recognizing things, may be essential to
concept-formation, e.g., that of an artwork. Landmann-Kalischer flags
one final objection to placing values and sensory qualities on a par,
namely, the dependency of the experience of beauty on the latter. But
such dependency, she submits, does not entail that &ldquo;a lesser
degree of being [is] to be ascribed to it [beauty]&rdquo;
(<em>Essays</em> 17f).</p>

<p>
Following these general reflections in support of the thesis of the
parity of values and sensory properties, Landmann-Kalischer
acknowledges that justification of the thesis turns on the question of
whether and to what extent the same degree of objective validity can
be ascribed to both sensory and aesthetic judgments. Both sorts of
judgments are immediate and pre-reflective and they have subjective
forms (e.g., &lsquo;this pleases me,&rsquo; &lsquo;I see blue&rsquo;)
as well as objective forms (&lsquo;this is beautiful,&rsquo;
&lsquo;this is blue&rsquo;). Landmann-Kalischer begins with the
subjective form, registering how they present themselves as judgments
of inner perception. An aesthetic judgment can be subjectively
unreliable due to the interference of a feeling, a distraction, or the
influence of a concept on our attention, all of which is analogous to
how we may &lsquo;mishear&rsquo; or &lsquo;overlook&rsquo; in the
domain of the senses. Whereas subjective reliability in the case of
the senses is measured by various tests, Landmann-Kalischer suggests
that something similar is possible albeit yet to be achieved in the
aesthetic domain. Still, in both cases, it is generally recognized
that there is a more or less &ldquo;maximal subjective
reliability&rdquo;, achievable through practice and education;
psychology, too, can assist by determining what is extraneous and thus
to be excluded.</p>

<p>
Turning from the question of subjective reliability to objective
reliability, Landmann-Kalischer notes that drawing out the analogy
between sensory and aesthetic judgments in the latter sense runs up
against an obvious difficulty. Whereas we can compare the adequate
stimuli of the sensations with the sensations themselves, we lack
anything of the sort in the aesthetic domain. Some regard this lack as
a reason to reject the claim that the two sorts of judgment are on the
same level, but Landmann-Kalischer points out that in no domain has
the connection between stimulus and sensation been given from the
outset (in fact it is still missing, she notes, in the case of smell).
So the fact that this sort of connection has not been determined for
the aesthetic domain is not a sufficient reason to reject the
possibility. Given the present lack of means to test aesthetic
judgments&rsquo; objective reliability, Landmann-Kalischer proposes a
possible way of theoretically determining the conditions of such
reliability. The proposal consists in</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
discussing the possible deceptions here in analogy with deceptions of
the senses and pointing out such deceptions in the history of
aesthetic judgments. For now the objectively correct judgment remains
a presupposition, an ideal, imaginary point that we must hope to be
able to find by setting aside all causes of deceptions.
(<em>Essays</em> 25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(<em>T&auml;uschung</em>, the word translated &lsquo;deception&rsquo;
here, might be better rendered &lsquo;illusion&rsquo; in some cases;
we speak, for example, more commonly of an optical illusion than an
optical deception.)</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer distinguishes three sorts of deceptions or
illusions with respect to sensations: psychological (e.g., optical
illusions due to attention straying from the optical object itself),
physiological deceptions (e.g., deceptions due to an impaired
receptive organ), and physical (e.g., illusions, like the bent stick
in water, that are principally due to the physical stimulus). Under
physical deceptions Landmann-Kalischer also includes deceptions that
are about intensity, e.g., deceptions due to the stimulus exceeding
upper or lower limits of sensation. Each of these sorts of deception
has its analogue in the aesthetic domain: psychological deceptions
(e.g., evaluating an artwork&rsquo;s historical or political
significance in place of its aesthetic value), physiological
deceptions (e.g., a judgment colored by an emotion or disposition), or
physical deceptions (e.g., deceptions due to lighting, arrangement, or
a performance&rsquo;s distortion of the aesthetic object).</p>

<p>
Having drawn the analogy between sensory and aesthetic
judgments&rsquo; reliability, Landmann-Kalischer argues that the same
basic truth criterion applies to both sorts of judgment. That
criterion is a judgment&rsquo;s agreement with other judgments. To be
sure, both sorts of judgment are immediate but, insofar as they lay
claim to objective reliability, they</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
either are not made <em>simply</em> on the basis of the immediate
impression or are nonetheless subjected to comparison after the fact
and modified accordingly. (<em>Essays</em> 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer identifies four groups of judgments expressing
agreement, on which the validity of sensory judgments depends. These
are agreements with: (1) other judgments of the same sense, (2)
judgments of other senses, (3) other individuals&rsquo; sensory
judgments, and (4) any other cognition, particularly scientific, that
we have of the things in question. After elaborating these four groups
with examples (differentiating universality and objectivity along the
way), Landmann-Kalischer presents four similar groups for value
judgments. These are agreements with</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(1) judgments of the same individual about the same object at another
time, (2) judgments by the same individual about other objects, (3)
judgments by others, and (4) judgments that have universal,
specifically scientific representations for their object.
(<em>Essays</em> 49)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just as the bearers of objective sensory judgments are not individual
impressions but the sum of them,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
so, too, what is decisive for the objective aesthetic judgment is not
the individual feeling of pleasure but instead an entire series of
impressions received from the object under different conditions.
(<em>Essays</em> 49)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this context, Landmann-Kalischer notes how placing aesthetic
judgments on the same level as sensory judgments can seem to underrate
them in one respect and unduly elevate them in another: to underrate
them because they lay claim to a universal validity that is denied
sensory judgments and to elevate them since they lack the universal
agreement that it is possible to have for sensory qualities. But it
seems to underrate them because aesthetic judgments are more
profoundly associated with the essence of being human. In general, a
person&rsquo;s value judgments matter far more to us than their
sensory judgments but this difference, Landmann-Kalischer adds, does
&ldquo;not justify any intrinsic contrast between these
judgments&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 52). As for the reason why the
alleged parity seems to overrate aesthetic judgments, the explanation
lies in the fact that they lack the &ldquo;factual universality&rdquo;
of sensory judgments (<em>Essays</em> 52). But, in addition to
pointing out structural reasons why many aesthetic judgments cannot be
or cannot as yet be shown to be in agreement, Landmann-Kalischer notes
that some elementary agreements (e.g., symmetry, thresholds,
proportion, and contrast) are recognizable as are certain common rules
(dealing, e.g., with perspective in painting, dramatic technique,
musical composition, and the like). Also complicating matters for
aesthetic judgments, in contrast to sensory judgments, is the fact
that the former involves &ldquo;the life of peoples&rdquo;, while the
latter typically concerns only an &ldquo;individual life&rdquo;
(<em>Essays</em> 53). So, too, while aesthetic objects are present in
nature and art, the latter are subject to the greatest
changes&mdash;changes, Landmann-Kalischer adds, that are by no means
based only on aesthetic viewpoints.</p>

<p>
Universal agreement cannot be the criterion for the correctness of
judgments since it would render contrary judgments unthinkable, ruling
out the sense or purpose of the criterion. The criterion is instead
the &ldquo;individual truth&rdquo; accorded &ldquo;individually
constant judgments about which no universal agreement reigns&rdquo;,
supplemented by the investigation&mdash;outlined in the essay&mdash;of
investigating each judgment for &ldquo;possible causes of its
deceptiveness (or illusoriness)&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 56f;
translation slightly altered). Thus, Landmann-Kalischer submits, in
conclusion, that the comparison of sensory and aesthetic judgments
&ldquo;in regard to their validity and the sources of deceptions in
them&rdquo; justifies the inference &ldquo;that beauty is to be
construed as a property of things in the same sense as sensory
qualities are&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 62).</p>

<p>
The cognitivist and objectivist position that Landmann-Kalischer
fashions in this, her first major essay, has significant ramifications
for contemporary debates in aesthetics. These ramifications have been
forcefully demonstrated in a recent study by Samantha Matherne.
Relying precisely on the line of reasoning in &ldquo;On the Cognitive
Value of Aesthetic Judgments&rdquo;, Matherne argues for the
advantages of Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s cognitivist and objectivist
approach over hedonist and Kantian approaches to the question of
aesthetic demarcation and normativity (Matherne 2020).</p>

<h2 id="ArtTru">3. Artistic Truth</h2>

<p>
Having defended the cognitive value of aesthetic judgments a year
earlier, Landmann-Kalischer argues in &ldquo;On Artistic Truth&rdquo;
(1906) that artworks, while not judgments themselves, express contents
that represent a specific sort of reality and thus can be judged to be
true or false. While mental representations in general represent
objective reality to varying degrees, art represents the reality of
the mind, including those mental representations themselves. In other
words, art relates to mental reality in the same way that mental
reality relates to objective reality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Art does not afford objective reality. It mirrors and portrays the
mental world instead, and it is true insofar as it portrays that world
faithfully, insofar as it succeeds in freeing the mental world from
its entanglement with objective reality (which overreaches often
enough precisely in naive consciousness) and in establishing it purely
on its own terms&hellip; . Just as we would never see our face were it
not for a mirror, so, too, we would never see our own inner life
opposite us &mdash;were it not for the mirror of art. (<em>Essays</em>
70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be sure, art is not the only way of representing the reality of the
mind; inner perception does as well. Still, art is in effect a mirror
of the soul, our only means of seeing what is otherwise only available
to &ldquo;inner perception&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 70). The emphasis
here, moreover, is on &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; since art differs from
psychology, precisely by making what is given to inner perception
accessible to outer perception, whereas psychology translates what is
so given into concepts (<em>Essays</em> 104). As Samantha Matherne
puts it, an artist is for Landmann-Kalischer &ldquo;someone who
conveys truths about psychic reality through an artistic medium&rdquo;
(Matherne 2023: 254).</p>

<p>
The forms of artistic truth correspond to three zones of consciousness
(sensations/perceptions, memories, and phantasy), each of which
exhibits in its own way three peculiarities of consciousness: its
representation of only a segment of reality, while sporting a center
and periphery, and being subject to conditions of the entire life of
consciousness (e.g., feelings and interests, personal and public).
Art&rsquo;s mirroring of sensations or perceptions is true when it
represents them</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
just as they are in consciousness, when they do not yet or no longer
serve as a means of cognition, when the correction that thinking makes
in them, for the purpose of the construction of objective reality, is
not yet or no longer performed on them. (<em>Essays</em> 73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In keeping with the pursuit of this sort of mirroring, painters are
interested in more sorts of colors than typically come into
consideration when the focus is on objective reality as such;
something analogous holds for the musician&rsquo;s palette of sounds.
The painter and the musician give objective expression to these
&ldquo;surplus&rdquo; sensations and their relations, and as they are
found in consciousness before or after they serve as means of
knowledge (consider, for example, a painting that captures the way a
stick looks bent in water or perhaps Cezanne&rsquo;s <em>Montagne
Sainte-Victoire</em>). So, too, traditional painting epitomizes the
way perception centers on an object against a background (e.g.,
Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>The Three Trees</em>).</p>

<p>
The difference between mental reality and what serves the purposes of
knowing is even starker in the case of memory-representations than
perceptions, so much so that the memory-representations openly
conflict with the latter. Our memories are typically selective and all
too often we fill in gaps in our memory with familiar representations;
so, too, we often remember only what we want to or at least have a
strong motive to remember, all the while doing so in a manner that is
little suited to afford &ldquo;a faithful picture of reality&rdquo;.
But these features by no means make memory&rsquo;s representations any
less a subject for art to mirror faithfully. To be sure, an
artwork&mdash;think of historical plays&mdash;may be considered untrue
if it violates certain accepted views of its theme that govern
memory&rsquo;s representations. But it can nonetheless faithfully
depict a memory of what happened or of a feeling that accompanied or
allegedly accompanied what happened. Therein lies the
&ldquo;success&rdquo;, i.e., the artistic truthfulness, of many a
Shakespearean historical tragedy (<em>Richard III</em>, <em>Troilus
and Cressida</em>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Only a strong feeling, relative to a theme [<em>Gegenstand</em>],
makes an artistically true portrayal of it possible since its
representation lives in our memory only under the influence of such a
feeling. (<em>Essays</em> 81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, just as a certain feeling makes a representation live on in
our memory and thus in its mirroring by art, so, too, it is a feeling
that principally drives phantasy&rsquo;s representations and
art&rsquo;s mirroring of them. (Indeed, Landmann-Kalischer maintains
that phantasy&rsquo;s representations differ from memory&rsquo;s only
by degrees, albeit producing deliberately what the latter does
nondeliberately.) This point is particularly evident in the case of
the fairytale&mdash;the genre that is predominantly phantasy and
&ldquo;cultivates in the most perfect manner what every art lives
from&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 87). While we otherwise long &ldquo;for
surprises, for the extraordinary, for everything that breaks up the
everyday and breaks through what is merely possible&rdquo;, in the
fairytale &ldquo;everything goes on as we would like it to&rdquo;
(<em>Essays</em> 86). &ldquo;In a fairytale&rdquo;, Landmann-Kalischer
continues, &ldquo;we feel free because it plays freely with the things
that we stand powerless against in life, the things that we have been
delivered to without any hope of rescue&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 86).
Wishes are an essential part of the life of the soul and it is left to
art to express these wishes, &ldquo;rewriting the natural course of
what happens and doing so in ways that flatter every longing (and to
that extent are artistically true)&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 90). But
the rewriting must not exceed the bounds of what could happen,
&ldquo;the probable&rdquo; in the sense of what must appear as capable
of being true.</p>

<p>
Having discussed the truth of art in terms of human
sensation/perception, memory, and phantasy, Landmann-Kalischer turns
to three ways of connecting their representations, two of
which&mdash;the probable and the necessary&mdash;draw on the
conjunction of objective reality, while the third&mdash;lyric
poetry&mdash;remains &ldquo;completely confined to the mental
world&rdquo;, dominated as it is by feelings. Beginning with the
probable, so dominant in the history of aesthetics, Landmann-Kalischer
notes that it is &ldquo;<em>what appears to be true</em>&rdquo;, a
psychological truth that coincides with neither the real nor the
phantastic (<em>Essays</em> 91f). But while this suffices for a fable,
a tragedy demands more, not that one thing can but that it must follow
another and, hence, overcomes our reluctance to accept it as true.
This same tragic inevitability is necessary when the tragic makes up
the content of epics in contrast to comedy which requires &ldquo;only
a very slight degree of probability&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 93).</p>

<p>
While the truths of tragedy and comedy correspond to different
underlying feelings identifiable in terms of modalities of objective
reality (the necessary and the possible respectively),
Landmann-Kalischer notes that &ldquo;all cognition aims at the
necessary conjunction of the given&rdquo;. But it is equally true that
this necessity is &ldquo;cognitively unattainable&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And here art enters. We seek the sense and interconnectedness of what
happens; reality does not supply it. We must first create it, but we
<em>must</em> do so. Art supplies it. In art&rsquo;s microcosms it
feigns the unattained and unattainable ideal as something attained.
Here it flatters the soul&rsquo;s fundamental intellectual need, even
as it flatters all of the soul&rsquo;s most irrational inclinations.
Although agreeing here in its orientation with the procedure of
science, in its fulfillment it nonetheless goes so far beyond science
that it expresses, again, an element of the <em>mental</em> world
(directly opposed to outer reality). (<em>Essays</em> 94)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer adds that it also satisfies an ethical need, once
again expressing as an artistic truth, the truth of the soul, its wish
for moral reassurance.</p>

<p>
Comedy and tragedy combine representations that truthfully depict the
reality of the mind in terms of (constrained by) the possibility and
necessity of those combinations respectively. Lyric poetry, as noted,
is different. In the case of lyric poetry, &ldquo;the
interconnectedness of the representations is not only
<em>dominated</em> by the feeling but is frequently only intelligible
at all on the basis of it&rdquo; (<em>Essays</em> 96). So, too, the
associations provided by simile and metaphor are said to
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; true inasmuch as that truth is an artistic truth,
expressing the mental reality of those associations and their
grounding.</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer concludes her survey of the parts of the reality of
the mind that art can represent by turning to feelings, a phenomenon
that plays no part in cognition in the way that representations and
their connections (possible, probable, necessary) do. Despite their
inner-worldly status and despite being incapable of representing
objective reality as do other basic mental phenomena (perception,
memory, phantasy), feelings are nonetheless expressed in ways that art
and in some cases art alone can represent. That is to say, feelings do
not remain captive of the inner world but instead are expressed both
in physiological-physiognomical ways and in actions. But the
expression is never pure in life and is only adequate to some degree
in art. For example, as Landmann-Kalischer puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[c]ustom and ethical life, pride and shame hold us back a thousand
times over from the action that would express our feeling adequately
&hellip; the more the spontaneous expression of feeling in actions is
inhibited by reinforced feelings of humanity, justice, self-respect
and respect of others, and the less the demand for such expression can
be satisfied in life, the more a people will be in need of art.
(<em>Essays</em> 101)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="DocBea">4. The Doctrine of the Beautiful</h2>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s posthumously published, four-chapter study,
<em>The Doctrine of the Beautiful</em> (<em>Die Lehre vom
Sch&ouml;nen</em>) begins with a chapter on &ldquo;the place of beauty
in the world&rdquo;. Following Goethe&rsquo;s lead, she recapitulates
the Greek discovery of how beauty arises in nature as a harmony of
countervailing forces, from the elemental to the vegetable to the
animal to the supreme beauty and its &ldquo;true, primal place&rdquo;
(<em>wahre Urort</em>): the human being, &ldquo;the supreme creation
of nature and the creator of art&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 11f). Beauty is
all the greater, the more powerful and antagonistic the forces it
combines: &ldquo;Beauty would not be beautiful were it not difficult,
were it not a victory&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 16). Nonetheless, the
&ldquo;paradox of beauty&rdquo; is that its victory, while hard won,
is non-violent, unforced, and free; an ordering that does not result
in domination. Landmann-Kalischer identifies certain &ldquo;basic
forms&rdquo; of harmony that underlie the different sorts of beauty
and correspond to the different spheres of existence: (1) the formal
harmony of measure and proportion, (2) the organic harmony of plant
and animal, (3) human harmony, (4) cosmic harmony, (5) artistic
harmony. Despite the obvious link between beauty and a certain
robustness and vitality, she advises that we cannot expect, given the
complexity of life&rsquo;s conditions, that everything that achieves
the capacity to live attains harmony and thus beauty in all its parts.
Many a movement of an animal, for example, is merely the expression of
&ldquo;an unsatisfied urge&rdquo;, leading Landmann-Kalischer to note,
emending Schiller, that &ldquo;the animal, too, is beautiful only when
it plays&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 23).</p>

<p>
Taking issue with some Christian and Oriental approaches to human
beauty, Landmann-Kalischer extols the human body as no less integral
to human beauty than the human soul. Nonetheless, &ldquo;where no
spirit animates it [the human body], no body is beautiful&rdquo;
(<em>LS</em> 28). What unfailingly beautifies a human being is a
bearing of humility and respect towards the dignity of the spiritual
world. Only the confusion that sometimes befalls the cultural world
could lead to the mistake of deeming a human&rsquo;s animal beauty
higher than genuine human beauty. Indeed, &ldquo;every beauty of an
animal nature cannot make up for ugliness or insufficiency of the
spiritual sphere&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 29f). But a strong and beautiful
spirit can triumph over an ugly body; indeed, it can lend a human
being a certain sublimity (think Socrates!).</p>

<p>
From the general principle that beauty is always a property of a
particular subject (e.g., the beauty of a boy is not that of a grown
man), Landmann-Kalischer draws three other principles. The
<em>first</em> such principle is that every species of being must
agree with itself if it is to be beautiful. This principle entails the
incomparability of one species with another (e.g., a birch is not more
beautiful than an oak) and the aesthetic pleasure this self-agreement
affords, including the &ldquo;incongruous joy&rdquo; where the
elements are ugly (<em>LS</em> 31). The <em>second</em> such principle
is that every exemplar of a certain species must correspond to the
norm of that species&mdash;a principle heralding the tension between
the contingent and law-governed. Thanks to this principle, individuals
of the same species are comparable, e.g., the oak struck by lightning
vs. the oak spared by the storm. The <em>third</em> principle
following from the general principle that beauty is always a
particular subject&rsquo;s property is that the height of the beauty
that something is capable of corresponds to its species. The higher
and more complicated the level of life, the higher the beauty but also
the greater the risk of ugliness. So, too, the fewer the successes (in
contrast to the beauty of the lower levels), so much so that the
humans appear in those cases as gods, exemplars of a different species
altogether.</p>

<p>
Although all human beauty is the beauty of the human spirit, this
hardly means that every human expression is beautiful. That spirit
itself and the soul as well must first be beautiful themselves and, as
with the body, their beauty depends upon the harmony of all their
functions and capacities, both cognitive and volitional, conscious and
unconscious. The human spirit is a whole and the development of one
side at the expense of others is uncomely. In this connection
Landmann-Kalischer cites the loss, since Classicism and Romanticism,
of the &ldquo;true content&rdquo; of the concept of the beautiful
soul, as it is lumped together with sentimentality. In order to secure
the concept, Landmann-Kalischer submits, we have to return to the
&ldquo;measure and harmony&rdquo;, the unity of the good and the
beautiful
(<em>&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#972;&sigmaf;</em>)
championed in the classical age of the ancient Greeks. Moreover, while
clearly visible and stamping itself in fixed forms (paradigmatically
expressed in Greek statuary), the &ldquo;true unfolding of spiritual
beauty&rdquo; takes place in life, in what a human being does and
omits doing, in the fate that the human being undergoes and shapes
(<em>LS</em> 40).</p>

<p>
Having explained (a) how the degree of beauty is a function of the
disparateness and power of the forces that achieve harmony in it and
(b) that the supreme, spiritual beauty stamps the beauty of the human
being, Landmann-Kalischer completes the opening chapter by reviewing,
with respect to human beauty, differences in age, gender, culture, and
peoples. While countenancing the biologically based differences in the
first two categories, Landmann-Kalischer notes how spiritual beauty
rises above them. With respect to cultural differences, she contends
that her conception of beauty as harmony countenances such
differences&mdash;&ldquo;There are as many types of beauty as there
are types of human being&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 44). Yet in this variety
there is also, she contends, &ldquo;a more or less large
approximation&hellip;to the absolute human beauty&rdquo; (<em>LS</em>
45). To this end she compares favorably&mdash;and, at least by
today&rsquo;s standards, quite controversially&mdash;the Idolino with
a bronze of the Chola dynasty, while reaffirming the homage paid to
&ldquo;the Greeks as the prototype of human beauty&rdquo;, by all
peoples who came in contact with them (<em>LS</em> 47).</p>

<p>
In the second chapter of <em>The Doctrine of the Beautiful</em>,
Landmann-Kalischer turns from &ldquo;the place of beauty in the
world&rdquo; to &ldquo;the creation of beauty in art&rdquo;. Artists
bring into being an even more complex harmony than otherwise surfaces
in nature, as they express the beauty of the human spirit in sensory
form. Echoing her early essay on artistic truth, Landmann-Kalischer
observes: &ldquo;Just as the nature surrounding [the human being]
found a mirror in his spirit, so he creates a mirror of his own beauty
in art&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 48). In the process, the artist works under
two defining constraints: the use of some material (&ldquo;<em>the
Urph&auml;nomen of art</em>&rdquo;) and the focus on a singular sense
modality. In contrast to the usual fleeting representation of things
via multiple sense modalities, &ldquo;we are all eyes&rdquo; when it
comes painting, &ldquo;all ears&rdquo; in the case of music
(<em>LS</em> 50ff).</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer identifies three equally essential elements of
artistic [<em>k&uuml;nstlerische</em>] beauty: (1) formal beauty,
i.e., the beauty of the forms and their organization (e.g., the
symmetry of columns, the proportions of a human figure, the splendor
and harmony of colors, the play of sounds and its rhythms, rhyme and
meter), (2) artisanal beauty (<em>artistische Sch&ouml;nheit</em>),
i.e., the artist&rsquo;s artistry and technical mastery of the
artistic means of portraying an object, and (3) the artistic content
(<em>Gehalt</em>), i.e., the object portrayed by the artist and the
artist&rsquo;s expression &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 68).
Just as the formal and artisanal beauty lose their sense when, instead
of serving as a means to forming an artistic object, either becomes
art&rsquo;s ultimate purpose, so, too, an object portrayed in the
artwork loses its artistic content when the artistic means (the first
two elements) disappear into it. &ldquo;The artistic object, which
always signifies a unity of I and world, falls apart when the artistic
means is left out of consideration&rdquo;, mistakenly rendering art
&ldquo;either naturalistic or expressionistic, either mere imitation
of nature or mere expression of the soul&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 72f).
While artistic beauty is a whole made up of the union of these three
elements, it is difficult to avoid confusing a part for the whole.
Nonetheless, Landmann-Kalischer submits, as this whole beauty remains
the &ldquo;sense and essence of art&rdquo; and all construals of art
to the contrary&mdash;not least the timeworn views of art as imitation
and as expression&mdash;are based upon that confusion. After making
her case in this manner against these traditional views of art and
citing the testimony of poets, she concludes this second chapter with
a review of the beauty of particular arts (poetry, painting,
sculpture, music, and architecture).</p>

<p>
Shifting from artist to aesthetics in the third chapter (&ldquo;the
grasp of the beautiful in the sense for beauty&rdquo;),
Landmann-Kalischer elaborates the aesthetic intuition, the aesthetic
state of mind (<em>Zustand</em>), and the aesthetic judgment. The
aesthetic intuition is empathetic in the sense that its object is
understood from within and what is given to our senses stirs up
&ldquo;the resonance of our soul&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 211). Aesthetic
intuition grasps the simplest forms as meaningful expressions of the
human. Thus, for example,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
music&rsquo;s effect is not connected to mere sounds; a melody is
taken up as the song of a soul; we give to birds, even instruments, a
heart analogous to the human. (<em>LS</em> 213)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet, while we see &ldquo;our own feeling dwelling in the intuited
object&rdquo;, that feeling is no longer personal, surfacing as it now
is in another medium (<em>LS</em> 216).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This feeling of the beauty of the object is an actual feeling and
experiencing it can be our most important concern; but the joy or
sorrow empathetically projected [<em>eingef&uuml;hlte</em>] into the
beautiful object is devoid of interest because it is no actual
feeling, no feeling of our own, but merely a represented feeling.
(<em>LS</em> 217)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Something analogous holds for the aesthetic object, removed as it is
from any connection to the actuality surrounding it. Thus, the piece
of canvas hanging on the wall is in no sense the reality of the
artwork and &ldquo;insofar as it is a work of art, it is not this
little piece of canvas&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 218). As for the aesthetic
state of mind, Landmann-Kalischer borrows extensively from Schiller,
portraying that condition as playful but nonetheless deadly serious,
since beauty alone <em>&ldquo;separates us from the
inhuman</em>&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 241). She refuses to distinguish the
ethical from the aesthetic effect of art, not least since &ldquo;the
supreme human possibilities are nowhere more visible&mdash;and nowhere
more impressively&mdash;than in the beautiful guise, the serious play
of art&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 244). This third chapter concludes with a
return to the arguments of her earlier essay on the cognitive value of
aesthetic judgment (see above), namely, that aesthetic judgments,
however fallible, are no less true or false than judgments of the
senses. &ldquo;Despite all the diverging judgments, we must assume
&lsquo;true&rsquo; beauty as objectively obtaining and knowable&rdquo;
(<em>LS</em> 249).</p>

<p>
The fourth and final chapter of <em>The Doctrine of the Beautiful</em>
addresses &ldquo;the place of beauty in the realm of values&rdquo;. In
contrast to self-centered, subjective animal values (the pleasing, the
useful), there are objectively valid, cultural values&mdash;the holy,
the true, the good, and the beautiful&mdash;that obtain in themselves.
Landmann-Kalischer regards the holy as the primeval form in which the
consciousness of all these other cultural values is rooted; so, too,
religion is &ldquo;the cradle of all culture&rdquo;, originally
cultivating the other values (<em>LS</em> 270, 302). In this
connection, while acknowledging the original unity of religious and
political life, Landmann-Kalischer argues at length that &ldquo;the
state as such does not belong to the cultural values&rdquo;
(<em>LS</em> 277). At the same time, she contends that both religion
and art stem from the &ldquo;holy in the primal sense&rdquo; and that,
while reason &ldquo;in ages of Enlightenment&rdquo; vainly tries to
replace the holy with the good or the true, &ldquo;only art can give
back the complete feeling of the holy&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 349f).</p>

<p>
Before addressing how the values are essentially related to one
another, Landmann-Kalischer discusses their relationship to one
another in different eras. In a section entitled &ldquo;the three ages
of culture&rdquo;, she distinguishes religious, rational, and artistic
ages, where the holy, the-true-and-the-good, and the beautiful
respectively held sway&mdash;albeit inevitably more or less, never
exhaustively&mdash;over the other values. The three ages exhibit three
sides and three stages of development of human existence, both
individual and collective. While a one-sided pursuit of any such value
sacrifices the completeness of a person&rsquo;s humanity, the
&ldquo;measure&rdquo; for that completeness is to be found only in the
art, which presupposes the harmonious development of all human
capacities (<em>LS</em> 282, 286). As one might expect,
Landmann-Kalischer cites the Middle Ages as the paradigmatic religious
age and the Enlightenment as the pre-eminently rational age, although
she is quick to add that these different ages seldom coincide with
specific chapters of human history. Among artistic ages, short-lived
and rare as they are, she counts the age of the Pre-Socratics (the
supreme if not the sole instance), the Italian Renaissance,
Elizabethan England, and German classicism (the era of Goethe and
Schiller)&mdash;each with a prefiguring and an afterlife of their
own.</p>

<p>
As noted above, art owes its origins, as do the other values, to the
experience of the holy. Yet while metaphysical, ethical, or political
motives shaped the great world religions, the only poetic religion is
that of the Greeks, whose poets gave them their gods, fashioning them
as sublime human beings and characterizing the Muses themselves as
gods. The Greeks&mdash;&ldquo;the people of
art&rdquo;&mdash;assimilated religion and poetry to one another, to
the enhancement of both. The contrast with &ldquo;the
ethical-philosophical religions&rdquo; could hardly be starker and
here Landmann-Kalischer includes ethical religions that inherit the
Mosaic law (make no images of God&mdash;a law that drives pictorial
art into the ornamental and impoverishes poetic fantasy) as well as
ascetic-philosophical religions where love of the earthly and the
human, the presupposition of the sense of beauty, perishes. Any
religion that centers its doctrine on another world runs the sizable
risk of sacrificing art and the sense of beauty to contempt for this
&ldquo;earthly vale of tears&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 296).</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer acknowledges the fear of the &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;
and the anxiety over powers beyond our senses and control as the
primal human experience (<em>Urerlebnis</em>) on which religion rests
(<em>LS</em> 287, 298). While religion reaches for some &ldquo;means
of coercion&rdquo; (<em>Zwangsmitteln</em>) to quell those fears and
fulfill human wishes, art makes no promises and only those not swamped
by fears can approach it. If art grants some measure of redemption, it
consists, not in the promised fulfillment of wishes but in
&ldquo;opening up a new world, the world of beauty, in which wishes
grow silent&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 298). While religion overcomes the
lack of harmony with the promise of another world, the piety of art is
directed at this world, overcoming disharmony &ldquo;through the
beauty of the world that it shows&rdquo;; so, too, while a certain
anxiousness &shy;&ndash; &ldquo;trembling between fear and hope&rdquo;
reigns in religion, the artist, by contrast, bravely &ldquo;trusts his
own feelings&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 299). Still, it remains difficult for
art, &ldquo;the higher zone of consciousness&rdquo;, to maintain
itself over against religion, &ldquo;since the negative, the fear from
which all religion proceeds, is always stronger than the positive, the
joy from which all art stems&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 301).</p>

<p>
Following this account of the relationship of beauty and art to the
holy and religion, Landmann-Kalischer concludes the book with two
sections on &ldquo;beauty and the values of reason: the good and the
true&rdquo;. The first section reviews the beautiful&rsquo;s fate
under the dominance of the rational; the second elaborates
beauty&rsquo;s overturning of the rational. In that first section
Landmann-Kalischer relates how, along with religion, art is called
before the tribunal of reason. But while this process is typically
identified with the Enlightenment, Landmann-Kalischer discusses its
complex prefiguring in antiquity (Hesiod, Plato, and Aristotle),
art&rsquo;s subsequent decline into matters of amusement and
instruction, form and content (among Stoics, Epicureans, and
Plutarch), the relegation of beauty to an expression of the good
(Plotinus, Augustine), and finally &ldquo;the Christian era&rsquo;s
complete contempt for beauty, along with all other worldly
goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;the battle that truth wages against
beauty&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 315).</p>

<p>
In late antiquity religion and poetry were inseparable means of
education and, hence, reason&rsquo;s battle against poetry at the time
was also a battle against religion. In the seventeenth century, by
contrast, poetry and art originally made common cause with the
Enlightenment&rsquo;s turn to this world and its battle against the
otherworldliness of religion. Yet the more reason extended its own
realm, the more it alienated itself from a sense for the beautiful.
Aesthetic feelings are said to grope vainly for what the intellect can
grasp clearly and distinctly; art becomes nothing more than
&ldquo;children playing, <em>delectatio puerilis</em>&rdquo;,
permission for which must first be fetched from reason, while anyone
who indulges in aesthetic pleasures cannot help but have a
&ldquo;guilty conscience&rdquo;&mdash;a sentiment exploited by
Rousseau (<em>LS</em> 317&ndash;320).</p>

<p>
While Landmann-Kalischer identifies a host of German writers who
contribute to overcoming reason&rsquo;s revolt against the muses, the
&ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of art and the value of beauty is epitomized by
Goethe&rsquo;s poetic genius and registered unmistakably in
Schiller&rsquo;s aesthetic letters. Yet while Schiller&rsquo;s
demonstration of the supremacy of the beautiful over the good is
airtight in her opinion, the same cannot be said for his and
Goethe&rsquo;s convictions about beauty&rsquo;s supremacy over the
true. To the extent that Goethe conceives truth as the source of
beauty and Schiller conceives art as the means to truth, their
thinking continues to fall in line with the Enlightenment. But
Landmann-Kalischer notes how Goethe and Schiller alike come to
recognize art as a way of taking up the world that is not a
stepping-stone to clearer knowledge but an organ of its own that
stands &ldquo;not beneath but above reason&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 323).
She relates how philosophers at best approximate this realization,
beginning with Kant&rsquo;s identification of a pure, aesthetic
feeling alongside the understanding and willing, allowing for the
beautiful&rsquo;s co-ordination with&mdash;not its subordination
to&mdash;the true and the good. By contrast, both Hegel and Schelling,
with all their profound aesthetic insights, ultimately champion the
Enlightenment&rsquo;s subordination of art to philosophy. If we are to
rise above speculative philosophy&rsquo;s claims about the limitedness
of the sphere of art and &ldquo;find new points of departure for
overcoming the true through the beautiful&rdquo;, it is necessary,
Landmann-Kalischer submits, to go back to the continuation of the
Goethean spirit in the likes of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and
George.</p>

<p>
In making the case for this move, Landmann-Kalischer reviews
Hegel&rsquo;s &ldquo;unproven&rdquo; contention that a certain
&ldquo;interiority&rdquo; (<em>Innerlichkeit</em>), a Stoic and
Christian legacy, &ldquo;towers over all other spheres of the
spirit&rdquo; and thus serves as the &ldquo;existential
presupposition&rdquo; that philosophizing is superior to the sphere of
art (<em>LS</em> 328). Landmann-Kalischer charges Hegel in this regard
with &ldquo;absolutizing&rdquo; a particular historical consciousness.
When she demonstrates how the rational is overturned by the beautiful,
she has in mind a beauty that realizes the true in concrete,
intellectual intuitions rather than dwelling on abstractions. Echoing
her work on epistemology, she insists that knowing by itself is an
incomplete capacity; &ldquo;it cannot grasp the things that it
shows&rdquo; and, from the standpoint of the human being as a whole,
it is &ldquo;the activity of a part&rdquo;
(<em>Teilt&auml;tigkeit</em>) that is instrumental in the transition
from drive to action (<em>LS</em> 329). The person who knows exercises
only one element of the soul, the person who acts&mdash;and, with a
nod to the artist, she adds, the person who displays or shapes
(<em>darstellt oder bildet</em>)&mdash;encompasses them
altogether.</p>

<p>
Reason&rsquo;s highest value is truth and it is essentially fixed on
finding the truth. &ldquo;But what truth it should seek&hellip;is not
subject to its jurisdiction alone&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 330f). In other
words, if truth is supposed as the supreme value, there is no value
that can determine what truth matters. By signaling the limits of
truth (its dependency upon other values) in this way,
Landmann-Kalischer repeats that she is not proposing that humanity
should step back from the heights that the development of reason has
helped it achieve. She only opposes reason &ldquo;insofar as it
proposes to posit the truth (that is its own supreme value) as the
value giving direction over our entire life&rdquo; (<em>LS</em>
332).</p>

<p>
Referring back to her work in epistemology, Landmann-Kalischer reviews
the transcendent character of knowledge. Knowledge
&ldquo;transcends&rdquo; (<em>transzendiert</em>) in one sense by
being directed at &ldquo;objects that can never be given to it&rdquo;
(<em>LS</em> 333). Every function of knowing also transcends in the
sense of always referring to another function (e.g., the perception of
the present moment to the memory of the moment that has just passed).
From transcending in both senses, Landmann-Kalischer infers that every
cognitive function is by itself less than self-sufficient, dependent
not only upon one another but ultimately (in their interdependence) on
intuition.</p>

<p>
The intuition here is an essential, higher form of knowing that refers
to a whole, whether it be the world as a whole or a concrete, existing
thing as a whole. This intuition is intellectual and sensory
(Landmann-Kalischer also dubs it &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;); it is, in the words of Schopenhauer,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the supremely attainable cognition [<em>Erkenntnis</em>]; not in
abstract knowing [<em>Wissen</em>] but in the correct and profoundly
intuitive grasp of the world lies the source of all wisdom.
(<em>LS</em> 337&ndash;339)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, precisely at this &ldquo;highest point of knowledge&rdquo;,
the thinker gives way to the artist since in the end truth lies, not
in what is universal but what is concrete and concrete truth is found
in poetry alone. Thus, Landmann-Kalischer submits, &ldquo;Poetry is
not only more philosophical than history, it is more philosophical
than philosophy itself&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 339).</p>

<p>
In Landmann-Kalischer&rsquo;s treatment of the beautiful and the good
(the final section of the study), she takes her bearings from
Schiller&rsquo;s writings, particularly in the ways it moves
critically and, in her view, trenchantly beyond the fundamental
conflictedness of Kantian moral thinking. Presenting only the
&ldquo;minimum&rdquo; that separates the morally sane from the
&ldquo;morally insane&rdquo;, Kant&rsquo;s determination of willing by
reason alone can hardly do justice to the virtue and goodness that are
the mark of human excellence when viewed in&mdash;and only
in&mdash;its entirety.</p>

<p>
Once again, beauty&rsquo;s holistic character gives it the edge over
the limitedness of a conception of a purely rational good that is not
incorporated in beauty. Beauty perfects human sensuality and
rationality, without suppressing one on the other&rsquo;s account; in
beauty, the celebration of the reconciliation and harmony of these two
sides of the human condition, the path to human freedom, is on
display. Stressing the affinity between Schiller&rsquo;s concept of
the beautiful soul (with its sublime disposition) and the ancient
doctrine of virtue, Landmann-Kalischer declares: &ldquo;If we make a
human good from within, he becomes beautiful; if we make him beautiful
on the inside, he becomes good&rdquo; (<em>LS</em> 347).</p>

<p>
Landmann-Kalischer concludes with a resounding rejection of the view
that beauty is merely the means to the other values, as though
appearance is something accessible without what appears&mdash;and vice
versa. An entire system of values appears in beauty and only in it is
the system in its inner interconnectedness visible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is with a view to beauty that all other values are first rightly
understood, first rightly applied, rightly dosed, controlled, limited,
etc. All other values are <em>abstracta</em>, values only of
properties that become concrete solely through the value that attaches
to the whole, i.e., through beauty. (<em>LS</em> 349)</p>
