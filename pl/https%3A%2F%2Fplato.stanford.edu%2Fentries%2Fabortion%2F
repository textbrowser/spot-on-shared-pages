<h1>The Ethics of Abortion</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 14, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy, either via
surgery or via the taking of medication. Ordinary people disagree
about abortion: many people think abortion is deeply morally wrong,
while many others think abortion is morally permissible. Philosophy
has much to contribute to this discussion, by distinguishing and
clarifying different arguments against abortion, distinguishing and
clarifying different responses to those arguments, offering novel
arguments against abortion, offering novel defenses of abortion, and
offering novel views about the relevant issues at stake.</p>

<p>
This entry&rsquo;s central question is: is abortion morally wrong?
This question has important legal and political implications. If
abortion is morally wrong, it is nevertheless an open and further
question whether abortion should be outlawed or legally restricted in
some way. It is also a substantive question how a society should
decide whether to outlaw or restrict abortion. This entry focuses on
the moral question and does not delve into these important legal and
political questions.</p>

<p>
The first six parts of this entry present six arguments against
abortion. Subsections of those parts present responses to these
arguments &ndash; that is, defenses of abortion. The seventh part
discusses why the ethics of abortion matters.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="ArgRigLif">1. The argument from a right to life</h2>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start by considering the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>The fetus is a person.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>All persons have a right to life.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Therefore, the fetus has a right to life.</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>It is morally wrong to kill something that has a right to
life.</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>Abortion kills the fetus.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.</p>

<p>
This argument has some real intuitive appeal. Abortion is the killing
of a human being, so it does seem to be the killing of a person. In
general, it is wrong to kill persons; it does seem that all persons
have a right to life.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll consider five lines of objection to this argument.</p>

<h3 id="EquObj">1.1 The equivocation objection</h3>

<p>
We might object to the argument from a right to life by arguing that
the argument equivocates. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; could have two
different meanings for the purposes of the argument. Suppose that
&ldquo;person&rdquo; means any animal that is a <em>human being</em>;
on this reading, saying a being is a person tells us what species the
being is. It is on this reading that claim 1 is obviously true: it
says that the fetus is human. But suppose that &ldquo;person&rdquo;
means &ldquo;moral person&rdquo; or something with full moral status
&ndash; something that counts fully for moral purposes, the way that
an ordinary adult human being counts. It is on this reading that claim
2 is obviously true: it says that all moral persons have a right to
life. The objection is that the argument is only plausible if claim 1
is interpreted with one meaning of &ldquo;person&rdquo; and claim 2 is
interpreted with another meaning of &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
What this objection shows is that the argument from a right to life,
as we have presented it, has two different versions. One version of
the argument uses &ldquo;person&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;human
being&rdquo; throughout. For this version of the argument, premise 2
is a controversial assumption: it says that all human beings, even
early human fetuses, have a right to life. Another version of the
argument uses &ldquo;person&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;moral person&rdquo;
or &ldquo;being with full moral status.&rdquo; For this version of the
argument, premise 1 is a controversial assumption: it says that all
fetuses, even the early human fetuses that die in first-trimester
abortions, have full moral status.</p>

<p>
This objection shows that the argument from a right to life has (at
least) one controversial assumption: either premise 1 or premise 2 is
controversial.</p>

<h3 id="VioCasObj">1.2 The violinist case objection</h3>

<p>
Suppose that a famous violinist is very sick with a serious kidney
disease. All medical records have been searched, and you are contacted
with the following surprising request: would you please come stay in
the hospital for nine months, lying in a bed next to the violinist, so
that your kidneys can cycle his blood? You are the only person who is
the right match to help him, and after nine months he will have made a
full recovery. You think it over, and reluctantly decline. While you
would love to help another person, spending nine months in the
hospital is a huge sacrifice that you are not prepared to make. The
next day after you decline, you wake up in the hospital, attached to
the violinist. It turns out that the Society of Music Lovers kidnapped
you. The doctor tells you that, while it was wrong to kidnap you, it
would also be wrong for you to unplug yourself: the violinist needs to
stay attached to you for nine months, or he will die. If you unplug
him, you would be killing him, and he has a right to life. While you
have a right to control what happens in and to your body, his right to
life is surely stronger.</p>

<p>
What may you do in this case? Surely you may unplug yourself. (So
claims Thomson 1971, which introduced this famous case.) But this
shows that the argument we have been considering, the argument from a
right to life, does not succeed. The violinist does have a right to
life; yet it is permissible to kill him. Thus, it is not always true
that one may not kill another human, just because that human has a
right to life. The violinist case appears to show that claim 4 of the
argument from a right to life is false. (The violinist case also
undermines another claim, the claim that it&rsquo;s not okay to
violate one person&rsquo;s right to life for the sake of a weaker
right; this is the claim that Thomson aims to undermine, when she
offers the case.)</p>

<p>
Note that the violinist case objection defends abortion while granting
the claim that the fetus has a right to life. The objector claims that
<em>even if</em> the fetus has a right to life, it simply does not
follow that abortion is morally wrong.</p>

<p>
Consideration of this case may adjust our moral framing of the choice
whether to abort a fetus. While it is natural to see this simply as a
choice whether to kill a living being, reflection on the violinist
case may lead us to see it rather as a choice whether to provide
life-sustaining aid to a living being &ndash; with the further fact
that one must kill that being to avoid providing the aid.</p>

<h4>1.2.1 Response from consensual sex</h4>

<p>
The violinist case might appear to defend abortion only in the case of
rape. It may seem to be important to the case that you were taken into
the hospital against your will.</p>

<p>
Thus, one might respond to the violinist case by offering a different
argument against the permissibility of abortion:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>A pregnant woman who has consensual sex is responsible for the
fetus&rsquo;s dependence on her body.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>If you are responsible for someone&rsquo;s dependence on something
of yours, then it is morally wrong to deprive him of that thing.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.</p>

<p>
To respond to this new argument, we might consider the following
variant of the violinist case. Suppose that after you declined to help
the violinist, you heard that the Society of Music Lovers was planning
to kidnap you. You could stay home, in which case you would be safe.
Or you could go about your normal life, with some hired bodyguards,
hoping that any kidnapping attempt would fail. You choose to go about
your normal life, with the bodyguards, and yet you are kidnapped and
hooked up to the violinist. Surely in this case (the argument goes),
you may still detach from the violinist, thereby killing him. This is
true even though your choice to go about your normal life was a
<em>cause</em> of your kidnapping, and in that sense you are
<em>responsible</em> for the situation in which the violinist is
dependent on you. Thus, claim 2 is shown to be false: although you are
responsible for his dependence, you may deprive him of your aid.
Surely a woman who has sex with contraception is no more
<em>responsible</em> for the fetus&rsquo;s dependence on her than you
are in this variant of the violinist case; thus, claim 2 is false as
applied to her case as well. (For further discussion of the
responsibility objection, see Kamm 1992 and Boonin 2003.)</p>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, one thing that emerges from considering this
worry is that it may matter whether having sex is a central and
important life activity, such that abstaining from sex would be a
significant burden. In the variant of the violinist case, it may be
important that staying at home to avoid kidnappers would be onerous.
Would refraining from sex similarly be onerous?</p>

<p>
(A different argument regarding responsibility holds that a pregnant
woman is a <em>mother</em> to the fetus and has the role-based duties
associated with that relationship. But that assumes that there is
already, and will be in the future, a meaningful relationship between
the woman and the fetus. See Little 1999.)</p>

<h4>1.2.2 Does the violinist case provide its own positive argument?</h4>

<p>
So far we&rsquo;ve discussed the way that the violinist case can be
used to defend the permissibility of abortion in the face of the
argument from a right to life. We might also consider using the
violinist case in an argument to establish that abortion is morally
permissible:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>If abortion is morally wrong, then it&rsquo;s morally wrong to
detach oneself from the violinist.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s not morally wrong to detach oneself from the
violinist.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, abortion is not morally wrong.</p>

<p>
This argument isn&rsquo;t made in Thomson 1971, but it is worth
considering. Much of the discussion about whether the violinist case
provides an effective response to the argument from a right to life
will also shed light on whether this is a sound argument. What are the
differences between the abortion case and the violinist case? Do they
make a moral difference?</p>

<h3 id="WhaRigLif">1.3 What is a right to life?</h3>

<p>
One might object to the argument from a right to life by probing the
question of what a right to life is, and what kinds of duties it
creates in others. This probing may provide another way of rejecting
premise 4.</p>

<p>
We can begin by noting that a right to life is not a right to be given
whatever is necessary to sustain one&rsquo;s life. If a person is
dying, and all that she needs to save her life is the touch of (famous
actor) George Clooney&rsquo;s hand on her forehead, then nevertheless
she has no right that he come to her bedside to cure her with his
touch. (See Thomson 1971, page 55.) Similarly, the famous violinist
mentioned above has no right to the use of your kidneys to cycle his
blood. And he has no right that you remain attached to him &ndash;
even though detaching yourself deprives him of what is necessary to
sustain his life.</p>

<p>
For a yet more fanciful example, suppose you are trapped in a tiny
house with a rapidly growing child. The house is very small, and the
child is extremely large &ndash; if his growth continues unchecked, he
will crush you to death. The child himself will be unscathed;
eventually he will grow big enough that the house will burst apart and
he will walk free. Does the child&rsquo;s right to life mean that you
cannot defend yourself from the threat he poses to you? Must you
simply submit to die in this way? Surely not, Thomson 1971 argues.</p>

<p>
It might seem that a right to life is at least always a right not to
be killed. But it is not always wrong to kill another person, even
though that person has a right to life. If someone attacks you, and
the only way to defend yourself is to kill him, then you may kill him.
And consider again the violinist: detaching yourself kills him, yet it
is permissible to detach yourself. These observations might seem to
show that if someone has a right to life, it is not simply wrong to
kill them, but rather it is wrong to kill them <em>unjustly</em>.
Perhaps a right to life is merely a right against being unjustly
killed (Thomson 1971). But if that is correct, then the argument from
a right to life needs a different premise:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>5*.</dt>
<dd>Abortion kills the fetus unjustly.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This premise is much more controversial than the original premise.</p>

<h4>Can self-defense justify abortion?</h4>

<p>
Some of the cases we have just been considering involve <em>innocent
threats</em> and the idea that a being with full moral status can
become liable to be killed in self-defense even when they are morally
innocent. For example, the growing gigantic child who will crush you
in your house unless you kill him first is not blameworthy for posing
a threat to you; but he poses a threat nonetheless.</p>

<p>
The idea that the fetus has full moral status from the moment of
conception can actually be used to argue for the permissibility of
abortion, as follows. Pregnancy itself is caused by the embryo, which
implants into the woman&rsquo;s uterus. If the fetus is an independent
person, then it is like a mentally incompetent agent who perpetuates
an illicit bodily intrusion against a woman, and then starts
redirecting vital resources and nutrition away from her. Understood in
this way, ending pregnancy is simply defending oneself against attack
from another independent being. (See McDonough 1996.)</p>

<p>
But one might deny that morally innocent threats can be treated in the
way that morally guilty threats can be treated &ndash; at least when
it comes to what third parties may do. Consider the following view: a
person who is threatened by an innocent threat may kill to save her
own life, but a third party may not choose sides between the innocent
threat and the innocent potential victim. On this view, the threatened
person has a mere &ldquo;agent-relative permission&rdquo; to defend
herself: while she can defend herself, that does not mean that a third
party can also act to defend her. (By contrast, it is of course true
that a third party can act to defend someone against a culpable
assailant.) If this view is right, then we cannot use the idea of
<em>self-defense</em> to defend ordinary surgical abortion in the face
of the argument from a right to life. While granting that women would
be morally permitted to perform abortions on themselves, it would not
follow that doctors are permitted to perform abortions. (See Davis
1984. For the view that doctors can act as the pregnant woman&rsquo;s
agent in her self-defense, see English 1975.)</p>

<p>
What should we think about this worry?</p>

<p>
First of all, it is important to note that the reframing of abortion
that the violinist case suggests need not be understood in terms of
&ldquo;self-defense&rdquo;; rather, abortion is reframed as
fundamentally about the withdrawal of aid.</p>

<p>
Second, it is implausible that mere <em>moral innocence</em> renders a
threat immune to attack from third parties. It does seem that a
temporarily insane person who rushes at an innocent person can be
killed by anyone, not just by the attacked person; this seems true no
matter how blameless the attacker is. (For more on innocent threats,
see Frowe and Parry 2024.)</p>

<h3 id="Pot">1.4 Potentiality</h3>

<p>
The objections we considered in sections 1.2 and 1.3 granted the
claims that fetuses are persons, and that persons have a right to
life: these objections granted claims 1, 2, and 3 of the argument from
a right to life. Let&rsquo;s turn now to considering a challenge to
claim 3, which holds that fetuses have a right to life. The objector
holds that having the <em>potential</em> to become a being with a
right to life (or with full moral status) is not sufficient to
currently have a right to life (or to currently have full moral
status).</p>

<p>
(Note that this objector will also deny either claim 1 or claim 2.
They will deny claim 1 if it is read as the claim that fetuses have
full moral status, or they will deny claim 2 if it is read as the
claim that all human beings have a right to life. See section
1.1.)</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll consider two different challenges to the idea that
potentiality is sufficient for a right to life.</p>

<h4>1.4.1 The kitten serum case objection</h4>

<p>
Suppose that there was a serum we could inject into kittens that would
make them into cognitively sophisticated cats; these cats would be as
intelligent as human adults, and they would have the emotional
complexity that human adults have. One of these cats would surely have
full moral status; it would surely have a right to life. (So claims
Tooley 1972, which introduced this famous case and offered the
following argument.) While we would have strict moral duties
concerning these cats, just as we have strict moral duties regarding
other persons, we would not have any duty to turn kittens into these
sophisticated cats: we would not be obligated to inject any kittens.
Furthermore, if a kitten were injected, but the serum had not yet had
any effect, it would be morally permissible to inject a neutralizing
agent that would prevent the serum from working; this would be just as
permissible as failing to inject. A kitten who had been injected with
the serum plus a neutralizing agent would be just like any ordinary
kitten. Kittens have no right to life: there is no moral requirement
to refrain from painlessly killing them (so the argument goes). But
now consider a kitten that has just been injected with the serum. It
has the potential to have a right to life. But it lacks a right to
life: it is morally permissible to inject the neutralizing agent and
then to painlessly kill it; this would not be morally permissible if
it had a right to life. So the kitten that has just been injected with
the serum is a counterexample to the claim that a being with the
potential to have a right to life must already have a right to life.
(This is the argument of Tooley 1972.)</p>

<p>
For those who believe we may painlessly kill kittens, this argument
poses a powerful challenge to the idea that fetuses have a right to
life. But the rhetorical effectiveness of this argument may be greatly
diminished by the fact that nowadays, many people think that animals
do have a right to life, or at least that there are strong moral
reasons against killing animals even painlessly.</p>

<p>
Perhaps a variant of the argument can nevertheless gain some traction,
even with those who believe that kittens do have a right to life.
Consider the view that all conscious animals have a right to life, but
that some animals have only a low level of moral status, while other
animals have a high level of moral status. On such a view, it is
natural to think that kittens have a low level of moral status,
compared to the full moral status that adult humans have. If we
consider the kitten serum case, it does seem right that we are not
morally obligated to inject any kittens with the serum, and also that
it would be morally permissible to inject a neutralizing agent after
injecting the serum. But this does seem to show something about
potentiality &ndash; it seems to show that having the
<em>potential</em> to have a certain level of moral status does not
already give a being that level of moral status. Consider a kitten
that has just been injected with the serum. It has the potential to
become a being with full moral status. If it already had full moral
status, surely it would be wrong to inject the neutralizing agent,
thus depriving it of the rich experiences that greater cognitive and
emotional sophistication would provide. But it is permissible to
inject the neutralizing agent; thus it does not already have full
moral status.</p>

<p>
Thus, even without the assumption that kittens lack a right to life,
the kitten serum case can provide something important: an argument
that the potentiality to have a certain level of moral status is not
sufficient for already having that level of moral status. (This
argument may provide a good response to other arguments against
abortion, even if it does not engage the argument from a right to
life.)</p>

<h4>1.4.2. The actual future principle</h4>

<p>
Another objection denies the significance of the fetus&rsquo;s
potential future by contrasting it with the significance of the
fetus&rsquo;s actual future. Arguments for the claim that potentiality
is sufficient for moral status may include claims such as &ldquo;the
fetus is the beginning stage of a person.&rdquo; But this is not true
for all fetuses. Some fetuses are the beginning stages of persons; the
fetus that became you was the beginning stage of a person. But many
fetuses are not; for a fetus that dies early in pregnancy, there is no
person such that they were the beginning stage of that person. On one
view, it is not potential future personhood but actual future
personhood that makes for moral status: according to the Actual Future
Principle, pre-conscious fetuses that will become persons already have
moral status, while pre-conscious fetuses that will die as
pre-conscious fetuses lack moral status. (See Harman 1999, which
introduces the Actual Future Principle and argues that the Actual
Future Principle makes sense of various commonly-held but apparently
conflicting claims, such as the following two claims: that early
abortion requires no moral justification, while nevertheless it is
appropriate to love (and wrong to harm) those early fetuses that are
being carried to term.)</p>

<h3 id="SelConObj">1.5 The self-consciousness objection</h3>

<p>
Another objection to the argument also targets claim 3, that fetuses
have a right to life. This objection holds that for a being to have a
right to something, the being must desire that thing. But to desire to
continue to live, one must have a conception of oneself as a being
that persists through time. Fetuses lack any such conception.
Therefore, they lack a right to life. (See Tooley 1972, which also
argues that human infants lack a conception of themselves and thus
argues that infanticide is morally permissible.)</p>

<p>
A distinct objection arises from the weaker claim that to have moral
status or a right to life, a being must be conscious (if not
necessarily self-conscious), because to have any interests at all a
being must be conscious. Since early abortions kill fetuses that are
not yet conscious, this view defends abortion in these cases. (See
Steinbock 1992.)</p>

<h3 id="MisObj">1.6 The miscarriage objection</h3>

<p>
Here is yet another objection to claim 3. If fetuses are really full
moral persons with a right to life, then whenever a miscarriage
occurs, it is a tragedy just like the death of any person. But
miscarriage is very common; at least ten percent of pregnancies end in
miscarriage. This would make miscarriage the greatest moral tragedy,
and the greatest public health crisis, that we face. (See Berg 2017.)
But this simply isn&rsquo;t true, so claim 3 must be false.</p>

<h2 id="ArgLos">2. The argument from loss</h2>

<p>
Consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Abortion deprives the fetus of a valuable future.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Killing an adult human is wrong (unless justified) because it
deprives them of a valuable future.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>If what makes killing an adult human wrong (unless justified) is
present in another activity, then that activity is also wrong (unless
justified).</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, abortion is wrong (unless justified).</p>

<p>
To understand this argument, let&rsquo;s start by considering the
claim that killing an adult human <em>is wrong unless justified</em>.
What does this say? The claim says that it is normally wrong to kill
an adult human, while acknowledging the reality that there are cases
in which it is permissible to kill an adult human; in these cases,
there is some <em>justification</em> for the killing. (See section 1.3
for discussion of the related fact that even though persons have a
right to life, it is sometimes morally permissible to kill them.)
(Sometimes philosophers talk of something&rsquo;s being <em>wrong
unless justified</em> by saying it is &ldquo;<em>pro tanto</em>
wrong&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>
The central innovation of this argument against the moral
permissibility of abortion is that it proceeds without claiming that
the fetus is a person, that the fetus has moral status, or that the
fetus has a right to life. It seeks to show that abortion is wrong
(unless justified) without a detour into those thorny issues. (The
argument was introduced by Marquis 1989. Relatedly, Quinn 1984 uses a
close examination of identity over time to argue that the fetus
suffers a significant loss in abortion.)</p>

<p>
The argument from loss is intuitively compelling. It is hard to
explain our reasons against killing adults without appealing to what
adults lose in death. And when a fetus is killed in an abortion, it
loses a tremendous amount &ndash; it loses out on (at least a good
chance of) life as a person. Not only does the fetus lose the same
thing an adult loses, but the fetus loses more of that thing.</p>

<h3 id="MorStaObj">2.1 The moral status objection</h3>

<p>
However, the argument&rsquo;s apparent escape from the thorny issue of
personhood and moral status may be an illusion. One might object to
premise 2 of the argument as follows. When we ask what makes it wrong
to kill a person, the fact that the person is deprived of a valuable
future is only a partial answer. This explains why the person&rsquo;s
death is bad for them. But what gives us a compelling moral reason?
That the person has moral status <em>and</em> that death is bad for
them are the two facts that together provide the compelling moral
reason, the objection asserts.</p>

<p>
The objector maintains that premise 2 is false, and that it would have
to be revised as follows to be true:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>2*.</dt>
<dd>Killing an adult human is wrong (unless justified) because it
deprives them of a valuable future and they have moral status.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The argument thus needs an additional premise:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>A fetus has moral status.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But claim 4 is controversial, and is exactly the controversial claim
on which the argument hoped to avoid relying.</p>

<h3 id="FutLikOurObj">2.2 The future-like-ours objection</h3>

<p>
Another objection takes aim at premise 1 of the argument from loss.
This objection denies that abortion deprives the fetus of a valuable
future. Now, it might seem obvious that abortion does deprive the
fetus of a valuable future. After all, if it were not for the
abortion, the fetus would very likely go on to have a normal life as a
person, and a person&rsquo;s life is well worth having, even given the
various hardships that people endure. The objector agrees to all of
that. What the objector denies is that the fetus now <em>has</em> that
future, and that the fetus is <em>deprived</em> of that future. The
objector claims that ordinary persons have a future that they lose in
death because ordinary persons bear strong psychological and
neurophysiological connections to their immediate futures, and
overlapping chains of such connections to their more distant futures.
Ordinary persons in the immediate future will remember the present,
and will have the same desires and intentions as in the present.
Furthermore, ordinary persons have some control (but of course not
total control) over how their futures develop. The objector claims
that it is these connections with the future that mean that a person
now has a future that they can lose. By contrast, fetuses early in
pregnancy do not have experiences that can be remembered, they
certainly do not have desires or plans, and they have no capacity to
control what happens to them. Thus, the objector claims, they do not
now possess futures that they can lose. (See McInerney 1990.)</p>

<p>
Similarly, one might object to premise 1 by saying that while the
fetus does lose out on a future life, that loss is of little
significance to the fetus currently. The &ldquo;time-relative
interests view&rdquo; (McMahan 2002) holds that how much something
good or bad in my future matters to me <em>now</em> depends on the
level of psychological connection between me now and me when I would
have that future experience. A good thing that would happen to me far
in the future, when I am a very different person, is less in my own
interests now, than something else which is less valuable but would
happen sooner, to a version of me that is more like my current self.
On this view, the pre-conscious fetus has no interest in any of its
valuable future, since it has no psychological connection at all to
that future. Even a fetus with some consciousness still has virtually
no psychological connection to its future, in that its future self
will not remember its current life; so it also has no interest in
getting to have that future life (DeGrazia 2007).</p>

<h3 id="HowRelVioCasArg">2.3 How this relates to the violinist case argument</h3>

<p>
The argument from loss is often taught to students alongside the
argument from the violinist case (see section 1.2). Since the first
argument is against abortion, and the second argument defends
abortion, the two arguments might appear to disagree. It is important
to see that they do not. The argument from loss concludes with the
claim that abortion is wrong unless justified. But this is the very
same assumption that the violinist argument <em>grants</em> to
opponents of abortion. The argument from loss seeks to make the case
that there&rsquo;s a strong reason against abortion. The violinist
case argument grants that there is a strong reason against abortion,
and argues that nevertheless abortion can be defended. (Marquis 1989
includes a brief paragraph stating the assumption that if there is a
strong reason against abortion, then, all things considered, abortion
is wrong; no argument for this is given, and Thomson 1971 is not cited
or discussed.)</p>

<h2 id="ArgGolRul">3. The argument from the Golden Rule</h2>

<p>
Consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>We should treat others as we would want to be treated ourselves.
(The Golden Rule.)</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>We are glad that we were not aborted.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, we should not abort others.</p>

<p>
There is some intuitive plausibility to this argument. (The argument
is offered by Hare 1975.) The claim that we should treat others as we
would want to be treated ourselves does seem right. Teaching children
the Golden Rule is a useful way of teaching them to treat other
children nicely.</p>

<p>
Like the argument from loss, this argument aspires to settle that
abortion is morally wrong without addressing the thorny question of
whether a fetus is a person, or has moral status. If the Golden Rule
is all we need, then we can side step these thorny issues.</p>

<p>
But the apparent side step may not work. An objector may say that
claim 1 is implausible when taken with sufficiently wide scope. Is
&ldquo;others&rdquo; meant to range over all things? All living
beings? It is too controversial in that form. Surely the plausible
version of claim 1 is this:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>1*.</dt>
<dd>If a being has full moral status, then we should treat it as we
would want to be treated.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This claim captures that we should treat persons as we would want to
be treated. It does not say anything about how we should treat
animals, if they have some moral status but not full moral status.
(And that&rsquo;s good: the Golden Rule is not very plausible when
applied to animals. We should not treat animals the way we treat
people. Or alternatively, &ldquo;the way we would want to be
treated&rdquo; would mean &ldquo;if we were animals&rdquo;; but then
we wouldn&rsquo;t really know what to say about that: it
wouldn&rsquo;t provide guidance.)</p>

<p>
But if the argument includes claim 1* rather than claim 1, then the
argument needs the following claim:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Fetuses have full moral status.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Thus, the argument can be rejected simply by rejecting the claim that
fetuses have full moral status. (See Harman 2009, footnote 12.)</p>

<h2 id="ArgIntVal">4. The argument from intrinsic value</h2>

<p>
Consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>It is wrong to destroy something with intrinsic value, absent
justification.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Human life has intrinsic value.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, abortion is wrong, absent justification.</p>

<p>
Like the argument from loss (section 2), this argument does not
establish that it is morally wrong to have an abortion, all things
considered. Its conclusion is that abortion is wrong unless it can be
justified. (Thus, as discussed in section 2.3, nothing in this
argument disagrees with the defense of abortion from the violinist
case (section 1.2).)</p>

<p>
It has been argued that popular opposition to abortion in the United
States is best seen as expressing a view along the lines of the
argument from intrinsic value (see Dworkin 1993). After all, opponents
of abortion in the United States often think that abortion in the case
of rape is morally permissible. This view would be hard to understand
if they believed that abortion was akin to the murder of an innocent
person. (It&rsquo;s not okay to murder an innocent person, even if
somehow murdering that innocent is the only way to psychologically
move on after having been raped.) So, we can make more sense of their
opposition to abortion if we see them as believing that abortion
involves the destruction of something with intrinsic value. This is
the kind of moral consideration that might be overruled by
considerations of the trauma that a rape victim is likely to
experience if she is forced to continue a pregnancy to term.</p>

<p>
It has been argued (by Dworkin 1993) that those who are
&ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; in the United States (that is, those who
believe that abortion should be legally permissible) are <em>also</em>
committed to the view that human life has intrinsic value. After all,
people who are pro-choice are typically reluctant to call themselves
&ldquo;pro-abortion&rdquo;; rather, they see abortion as a regrettable
occurrence that should nevertheless be available to women. It would be
far better if unwanted pregnancy were entirely avoided through
effective birth control, they think. They do think that something bad
happens in an abortion; they simply think that it is not wrong to
cause this bad outcome. After all, they acknowledge that it makes
sense to regret an abortion, and that abortion is not as trivial as an
appendectomy. (Similarly, Hursthouse 1991 argues that abortion
&ldquo;is always a matter of some seriousness&rdquo; (page 238).)</p>

<p>
Thus, on the view we&rsquo;re considering, those in the United States
who oppose abortion and those who defend abortion rights actually have
very similar views. They are not diametrically opposed, one side
believing that abortion is trivial and the other believing that
abortion is murder. Rather, both sides agree that human life has
intrinsic value; they simply disagree on the significance of this
fact: how bad is the fetus&rsquo;s death, and what does it take to
justify causing that death? This is a disagreement of degree, not of
kind, the view holds. (For another argument that both sides of the
abortion debate accept the same basic principles, see Warnke
1999.)</p>

<p>
Against the claim that those opposed to abortion are opposed on the
grounds that fetal life has intrinsic value, it has been pointed out
that many U.S. citizens are Catholic, and the Catholic church does
treat abortion as murder (Thomson 1995).</p>

<p>
And against the claim that those who are &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; also
believe that fetal life has intrinsic value, it has been argued that
we can make sense of regret for abortion, and of the fact that
abortion is not trivial, by appeal to the significance of the flipside
of abortion: continuing a pregnancy is of great moral consequence
(Harman 1999).</p>

<p>
(Dworkin 1993 draws a political and legal conclusion from his claim
that both sides of the abortion debate believe that fetal life has
intrinsic value and simply disagree about what it takes to justify
destroying that value. He adds the further claim that beliefs about
the value of fetal life are religious in nature. His conclusion is
that we cannot outlaw abortion, because that would impose a religious
view on some people who don&rsquo;t hold it. Dworkin nevertheless
holds that, because abortion is a serious matter, waiting periods may
be legally imposed. Stroud 1996 responds that we can&rsquo;t in
general impose waiting periods on people while they work out where
they stand on religious questions; for example, it would not be okay
to impose a waiting period before joining a church.)</p>

<h2 id="ArgMorRis">5. The argument from moral risk</h2>

<p>
Consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>If you have considered arguments that abortion is wrong and
rejected them, you may have made a mistake in your reasoning: there is
some chance that abortion is seriously wrong despite your rejection of
these arguments.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>If there is some chance that abortion is seriously wrong, then in
having an abortion you would be taking a moral risk.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>There is a strong moral reason against taking a moral risk of
doing something seriously wrong.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, there is a strong moral reason against having an
abortion.</p>

<p>
This argument holds that, from the perspective of anyone deciding
whether to have an abortion, even if she has rejected arguments
against the permissibility of abortion, there is nevertheless a strong
moral reason against abortion given by the moral risk that she would
be taking. There&rsquo;s some chance that she&rsquo;s mistaken about
whether abortion is morally permissible; perhaps, contrary to her own
thinking, abortion is morally wrong. (The argument is offered in
Moller 2011.&nbsp; A similar argument against abortion is made by
Lockhart 2000. Baker 2016 uses considerations of moral risk to argue
that abortion should be illegal.)</p>

<p>
One thing to emphasize about this argument is that it holds that there
is a strong moral reason against abortion even if in fact all the
anti-abortion arguments are bad arguments. The mere existence of these
arguments, and the fallibility of our own moral reasoning, generates a
strong moral reason against abortion even if, in itself, abortion is
really morally unproblematic.</p>

<p>
How might one respond to this argument? One might grant the conclusion
and hold that nevertheless, actual abortions are permissible because
the burdens on women of not aborting are significant. (Moller 2011
allows that this may be the case.) One might deny that someone whose
moral reasoning is sound really is in a position in which she should
acknowledge that it might be true that she is mistaken about the
ethics of abortion. Or, one might challenge the idea that this kind of
epistemic moral risk &ndash; stemming from the possibility that
one&rsquo;s moral thinking is mistaken &ndash; generates any moral
reasons at all: one might hold that while non-moral risks generate
moral reasons, purely moral risks do not (Weatherson 2019 and Harman
2015).</p>

<h2 id="ExpArgAgaSelAbo">6. The expressive argument against selective abortion</h2>

<p>
Some arguments conclude that some abortions are wrong (including some
early abortions), without also concluding that all abortions are
wrong. Some abortions are performed because prenatal testing reveals a
genetic abnormality in the fetus that would cause the fetus to be
disabled. Consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent nobottommargin">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Abortion of an otherwise wanted pregnancy because the fetus will
have a disability expresses a discriminatory attitude: that disabled
people should not have been born, don&rsquo;t have a right to exist,
or are less valuable than non-disabled people.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Expressing a discriminatory attitude like that is morally
wrong.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="indent notopmargin">
Therefore, Abortion of an otherwise wanted pregnancy because the fetus
will have a disability is morally wrong.</p>

<p>
This argument is compatible with the claim that, in general, abortion
is morally permissible. According to this argument, it&rsquo;s the
reason for these abortions that makes them wrong, not the mere fact
that they are abortions. (See Asch 1989, Wendell 1996, and Parens and
Asch 2000.)</p>

<p>
One way of arguing for premise 1 would be to point out that
prospective parents often have mistaken, distorted impressions of what
life with a disability involves, and doctors and genetic counselors
too often emphasize the negatives without sharing positive stories of
lives of disabled persons (Parens and Asch 2000, Kaposy 2018). Many
disabled persons argue that a life with a disability is not a worse
life than a life without a disability, when all is considered (Barnes
2016).</p>

<h3 id="BurObj">6.1 The burdens objection</h3>

<p>
One objection to this argument disputes premise 1 by saying that a
pregnant woman may worry not that her disabled child would have too
hard a life, but that raising the child would be too difficult for her
and her family, given their limited resources. For example, she might
already be raising a disabled child. (See Kittay 2019.)</p>

<h3 id="ObjPreDis">6.2 The objection from preventing disability</h3>

<p>
Another objection to this argument disputes premise 1 by pointing out
that women can morally permissibly prevent their fetuses from becoming
disabled by taking folic acid and avoiding medicines that would cause
abnormalities in their fetuses. Thus, it appears that it is morally
legitimate for parents to aim to have non-disabled children. (See
Parens and Asch 2000.)</p>

<h3 id="ObjLacHar">6.3 The objection from lack of harm</h3>

<p>
A third objection to the argument disputes premise 2 by saying that
expressing a discriminatory attitude is morally wrong only if the
expression leads to harm for the relevant people. The objector then
goes on to argue that it is very hard to show, and it is implausible,
that there are any harms that disabled people suffer that they would
not suffer if these expressions did not occur. After all, there is
unfortunately plenty of prejudice against disabled people, independent
of people&rsquo;s procreative decisions and what they express. (See
Nelson 2007.)</p>

<h3 id="ObjEquAboVal">6.4 The objection from equivocation about value</h3>

<p>
A fourth objection to the argument points out that there is a
difference between holding that a disability would be bad for the
person who is disabled, on the one hand, and holding that disabled
persons are less valuable or less worthy of existing, on the other
hand. The objector maintains that abortion of a disabled fetus
expresses only the first of these ideas, not the second.</p>

<h2 id="WhyEthAboMat">7. Why the ethics of abortion matters</h2>

<p>
If abortion is murder, then it&rsquo;s quite straightforward why the
ethics of abortion matters: there is murder going on, and we should
recognize that. But suppose that abortion is not murder; indeed,
suppose that abortion is morally permissible. Why is that fact
important?</p>

<p>
The violinist case argument (Thomson 1971) looms large in
philosophical teaching and discussion of abortion. The argument aims
to establish that <em>even if</em> fetuses have a right to life, then
nevertheless abortion is permissible. But there are two ways in which
the prominence of this argument is misleading regarding what is at
stake when it comes to the ethics of abortion. First, the argument
proceeds by relying heavily on the burdens on a woman of
<em>pregnancy</em>: it is precisely because pregnancy is onerous (and
pregnancy and childbirth are dangerous) that we may permissibly
decline to undergo these burdens for another, even if that other has a
right to life. But the importance to women of abortion access is not
fundamentally about the burdens of pregnancy; it is also about the
burdens and life-altering nature of <em>motherhood</em>. The
liberation of women has depended crucially and fundamentally on
women&rsquo;s gaining the ability to decide whether, and when, to
become parents to new children. The autonomy of women is at stake.
(The burdens of pregnancy might be enough to entitle women and anyone
who can become pregnant to a right to abortion, but they alone do not
tell the fundamental story of why that right is needed.)</p>

<p>
Second, and relatedly, the argument proceeds by <em>granting</em> that
fetuses have a right to life. While it is certainly important to show
(if it can be done) that abortion is permissible even on this
assumption, it is also important for us to remember&mdash;in thinking
about the importance of the ethics of abortion&mdash;that the claim
that fetuses have a right to life is a controversial claim that no one
is entitled to take as common ground. And without that claim, there is
no need to appeal to <em>the burdens of pregnancy</em> to justify
abortion. Indeed, there is no need for justification at all.</p>

<p>
One might object that pregnancy cannot force anyone into motherhood as
long as one has the option of making an adoption plan for one&rsquo;s
child. A pregnant woman can avoid motherhood by continuing her
pregnancy and making an adoption plan&mdash;there is no need for
access to abortion to avoid motherhood. But this objection ignores the
reality that many women bond with and come to love their fetuses while
they carry them to term, and/or many women simply prefer not to make
an adoption plan for their own child, even while they would strongly
prefer to end a pregnancy and not to become a mother to a new child at
this time. Thus, the reality is that restrictions of abortion access
consign many women to motherhood at times they would prefer not to
become mothers&mdash;even if the option to make an adoption plan is
available. And of course, it is not just women who are affected in
this way, but <em>anyone who can become pregnant</em>; this includes
women, some nonbinary persons, and transgender men. For many pregnant
people, lack of access to abortion forces them to turn a fetus that
they think does not matter at all into a child they deeply love. (See
Harman 2021.)</p>
