<h1>Relational Quantum Mechanics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Feb 4, 2002; substantive revision Tue Feb 4, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) is the most recent among the
interpretations of quantum mechanics that are widely discussed today.
It was introduced in 1996, with quantum gravity as a remote motivation
(Rovelli 1996); interests has grown since, first very slowly, but
steadily, and has peaked during the last years (see Calosi and Riedel
2024, also for a good account of the historical evolution of the
interpretation).</p>

<p>
RQM does not interpret the confusion about quantum theory as a sign
that what is necessary to render the theory intelligible is a new
equation (as in De Broglie-Bohm theory), some not-yet observed
phenomena (as in the physical collapse hypotheses), or the assumuption
of the existence of an unaccessible domain of reality (as the Many
Worlds&rsquo;s universal quantum state.) Rather, it interprets quantum
phenomena as an invitation to a radical update of the conceptual
framework we use to think about reality.</p>

<p>
RQM is a refinement of the textbook interpretation, where some aspects
of the role played by the &ldquo;Copenhagen observer&rdquo; (but not
all of them) are not limited to the classical world, but can rather be
played by any physical system. The interpretation rejects an ontic
construal of the quantum state: the quantum state play only an
auxiliary role, akin to the Hamilton-Jacobi function of classical
mechanics. It is instead based on an ontology of physical systems and
physical variables, as is classical mechanics. The difference with
classical mechanics is double (a) <em>variables only take value at
discrete interactions</em> and (b) the value a variable takes is only
<em>relative</em> to the (other) system affected by the interaction.
Here &ldquo;relative&rdquo; is in the sense in which in classical
mechanics velocity is a property of a system <em>relative</em> to
another system. These relative events occur at discrete times, and
consist of physical variables taking on precise relative values; these
variables may lack any value at all in intermediate times. At least in
some readings, as discussed below, this leads to a radical
perspectival antifoundationism. The technical basis of RQM is the
following</p>

<p>
Main Assumption: <em>The probability distribution for (future) values
of variables relative to a system \(S\) depend on (past) values of
variables relative to the same system \(S\), but not on (past) values
of variables relative to another system \(S'\).</em></p>

<p>
The interpretation does not require, for its formulation, the
assumption of a classical world. Measurement does not play any
fundamental role, and it does not require certain special systems to
be counted as &lsquo;observers&rsquo;. Instead, it assumes that any
physical system can play the role that the Copenhagen&rsquo;s observer
assumes in bringing about values of variables at a given time. This is
possible without changing the predictions of quantum theory, thanks to
the Main Assumption, because the interference observed by a system
\(S\) is not erased by the actualisation of variables relative to a
different system \(S'\) (it can of course be suppressed by
decoherence). In the Wigner-Friend situation, the interference
observed by Wigner is compatible with Friend&rsquo;s determined
observation. In this way, RQM succeeds in making sense of a fully
quantum world without requiring hidden variables, many worlds,
physical collapse mechanisms, or a special role for mind, agents, or
similar.</p>

<p>
The price to pay for this parsimony is a weakening of the conventional
(&ldquo;strong&rdquo;) realism of classical mechanics where physical
variables are assumed to have values which are non-relational and
exist at every time. The fact that variables take value only at
interactions gives a sort of sparse event (or &ldquo;flash&rdquo;)
ontology; the fact that they are labeled by the system to which they
refer, adds a level of indexicality to the representation of the
world, and raises philosophical issues.</p>

<p>
By itself RQM is metaphysically neutral, but it has a strong
relational stance that questions strong realism (Laudisa 2019), in a
sense discussed below. Because of this tinkering with realism, RQM has
been framed, in turn, in the context of various philosophical
perspectives, including constructive empiricism (van Fraassen 2009),
neo-Kantism (Bitbol 2007 [Other Internet Resources], Bitbol 2010),
anti-monism (Dorato 2016), structural realism (Candiotto 2017),
Perspectival realism (Massimi 2022), metaphysical coherentism (Dorato
and Morganti 2022) and anti-foundationalist coherentism. (See also
Brown 2009, Wood 2010 [Other Internet Resources], and especially the
extended discussion in Calosi and Riedel 2024.) The interpretation has
many aspects in common with Dennis Dieks&rsquo; Perspectival Quantum
Realism (Dieks 2022, Bene and Dieks 2002), with QBism (Fuchs 2001,
2002 [Other Internet Resources]), with Healey&rsquo;s pragmatist
approach (Healey 1989, 2023) and with the view of quantum theory
discussed by Zeilinger and Bruckner (Zeilinger 1999, Brukner &amp;
Zeilinger 2003).</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="MainIdea">1. Main Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="ValuPhysVari">1.1 Values of physical variables</h3>

<p>
The starting point of RQM is that quantum mechanics is not about a
wave function or a quantum state \(\psi\); it is about values of
physical variables. The basic ontology assumed by RQM, accordingly,
includes only physical systems and variables that take values, as in
classical mechanics. For instance, a real fact is the position of a
particle having a certain value \(x\) at a certain time \(t\). Facts
as this one (&ldquo;the particle is at \(x\) at time \(t\)&rdquo;) are
called &ldquo;events&rdquo;, or &ldquo;quantum events&rdquo;. Quantum
theory is about such events. There are however two differences between
facts in quantum mechanics and facts in classical mechanics. In
classical mechanics, there are two general assumptions that are
abandoned in RQM:</p>

<p>
(a) In classical mechanics it is assumed that all the variables of a
system have a value at every time. RQM, on the contrary, assumes that
in nature this is in not the case in general (Heisenberg 1925; Kochen
&amp; Specker 1967). Physical variables have values only at some
times, and have no value at the other times. Events, in other words,
are discrete. Variables have values when a system acts on another
system. More precisely, for a system \(S\) to have a variable \(A\)
taking a value <em>is</em> to interact with a second system \(S'\);
the variable \(A\) characterizes the effect of a certain action on
\(S'\). In RQM, this is what it means for a variable to have a value.
That is, for a system to be described by a variable taking a value
<em>is</em> to affect another system in a certain manner, and nothing
else. This is the basic intuition that led Heisenberg to find the key
to quantum mechanics in 1925; there are questions that make sense in
classical mechanics, but have no significance in nature. For instance,
the question &ldquo;What is the \(y\)-component of the spin of an
electron when its \(z\)-component is \(\frac{1}{2} \hslash\)?&rdquo;
is meaningless: neither it admits an operational definition, nor is it
needed for a realistic understanding of nature.</p>

<p>
(b) The second assumption of classical mechanics dropped in RQM is
that variables take absolute values, namely values independent from
any other systems. Instead, RQM assumes that <em>all</em> (contingent)
physical variables are relational. Contingent variables are those
represented by phase space functions in classical theory. Any value
that these variables take is (implicitly or explicitly) labelled by a
second physical system. If the variable \(A\) of a system \(S\) takes
a value in the interaction with a second systems \(S'\), the value it
takes is <em>relative to</em> \(S'\). The actualisation of an event
itself is relative to a system. The concrete meaning of this is the
assumption above, according to which future ways the system \(S\)
affects \(S'\) depend (probabilistically) on the values that variables
of \(S\) have taken with respect to \(S'\), but <em>future ways the
system \(S\) affect a third system \(S''\) do not</em>. The ensemble
of all events relative to an arbitrary system \(S'\), together with
the probabilistic predictions these entail, is called the
&ldquo;perspective&rdquo; of \(S'\).</p>

<p>
Dropping these two assumptions breaks away from a venerable conceptual
structure that has long underpinned physics in particular and perhaps
our worldview in general: the idea that the world can be though as
composed by systems that at any time have variable properties by
themselves, irrespectively from any other system, and these properties
can be describes by the values taken by variables characteristic of
the system in itself.</p>

<p>
The claim at the basis of RQM is that &ldquo;different observers can
give different accounts of the same set of events&rdquo; (Rovelli
1996: 1643). Textbook quantum mechanics is a complete description of
the perspective of a single system, but it disregards the effect of
this system on the perspective of other systems. RQM emphasises the
fact that any observer itself behaves as a quantum system, when acting
on other systems. Vincenzo Fano (2024 [Other Internet Resources])
gives a simple illustration of how RQM applies to common apparently
paradoxical situation in quantum mechanic. The relation between
perspectives is discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="RelaVariDiffObseGiveDiffAccoSameSetEven">1.2 Relative variables: &ldquo;Different observers can give different accounts of the same set of events&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Relative variables are variables whose value does not depend on a
single system, but rather on two systems. A well known example is the
velocity of an object in classical mechanics. The velocity is
implicitly or explicitly relative to a second object. There is no
&ldquo;velocity of a single object&rdquo;, irrespectively on any other
object, in classical mechanics. Other well-known examples are the
electric potential (only the potential of a conductor with respect to
another conductor has physical meaning) and position (only position
with respect to some other object has physical meaning). Relational
quantum mechanics takes a further long step in this direction,
assuming that we can make sense of quantum mechanics by assuming that
<em>all</em> physical variables are relational in this sense.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Relative&rsquo; does not mean subjective. Subjects, or agents
play no special role in RQM. When we say that our speed is 11km/second
with respect to the Sun, we are not attributing subjectivity to the
Sun. When we say that the distance between a signpost and a road
intersection is 100 meters, we are not thinking that a road&rsquo;s
intersection is an agent. In a naturalistic perspective, a person, an
agent, a subject, are physical systems; the world they relate to is
described by the value of the variables <em>with respect to</em> them.
A person dwelling on the Earth sees the Cosmos rotating because the
Earth is spinning; but the Cosmos rotates with respect to the frame
defined by Earth irrespectively from the existence of persons on the
Earth. To say that RQM requires subjects or agents is the same mistake
as saying that our explanation of the daily rotation of sun moon and
stars around the Earth requires to take agency or subjectivity into
account: a nonsense. There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or
mentalistic, in RQM.</p>

<h3 id="ObseMeas">1.3 Observer and measurement</h3>

<p>
In textbook presentations, quantum mechanics is about measurement
outcomes obtained when an &ldquo;observer&rdquo; makes a
&ldquo;measurement&rdquo; on a quantum system. Such measurements are
not generic interactions between two systems. They are special kinds
of interactions. They require that information is registered and
stored. For this to happen, there must be decoherence and dissipation,
hence a classical domain. RQM extends the interpretation of the theory
to the regimes where decoherence and dissipation are not sufficient to
underpin the &ldquo;observer-measurement&rdquo; interpretation. When
decoherence is sufficient, the values of variables becomes
&ldquo;stable&rdquo; (Di Biagio and Rovelli 2021): their label become
irrelevant and measurments have determined outcomes within that
decoherence domain.</p>

<p>
According to RQM, therefore, quantum mechanics is not a theory of the
dynamics of an entity \(\psi\), from which the world of our experience
somehow emerges. It is instead a theory about the standard world of
our experience, described by values that conventional physical
variables take at interactions, and about the transition probabilities
that determine which values are likely to be realized, given that
others were. This is compatible with quantum phenomena, if the
relative character of variables is taken into account.</p>

<h3 id="WaveFunc">1.4 The wave function</h3>

<p>
In RQM, the quantum state is a mathematical device that refers to two
systems, not a single one. It codes the values of the variables of the
first that have been actualised in interacting with the second
(Groenewold 1957); it therefore codes in particular anything we can
predict regarding the future values of these variables, relative to
the second system. The state \(\psi\) , in other words, can be
interpreted as a compendium of information accessible to a second
system, determined by a specific history of interactions. Understood
in this manner the quantum state is always and only a <em>relative
state</em> in the sense of Everett (1957). In this sense RQM is
strongly &ldquo;Everettian&rdquo;. It is so in a different sense than
the Many Worlds interpretations, which includes a hypothetical
universal wave function of which the various relative states \(\psi\)
are branches. The universal wave function plays no role in RQM (nor in
any physical application of quantum theory.).</p>

<p>
Several presentations of quantum theory interpret the wave function of
a system, or its quantum state \(\psi\), as properties of the system
as such. From the perspective of RQM, this is what generates the
confusion about quantum theory (Rovelli 2018). RQM is realist about
quantum states in the weak sense that they represent something
physically real: for instance, after a procedure that we call
&ldquo;state preparation&rdquo;, there is a matter of fact about what
that preparation was; preparations giving distinct pure quantum states
correspond to distinct physical states of affairs. These &ldquo;states
of affaires&rdquo;, however, are<em> relative to the preparation
apparatus</em>, they are not states of the system alone. This, in
particular, renders RQM compatible with the &psi;-Ontology theorems
like the PBR theorem for the reality of the wave function (Pusey,
Barrett, &amp; Rudolph 2012; Leifer 2014). The PBR theorem applies to
RQM, construed as a theorem about relative states. The peaceful
coexistence between between RQM these theorems has been discussed in
(Calosi and Oldofredi 2021).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, RQM does not make use of the notion of the
<em>absolute</em> state of a system or of the idea &ndash; common in
other interpretations &ndash; that the quantum state could represent
&ldquo;all there is&rdquo; about that system. This &ldquo;strongly
realistic&rdquo; interpretation of the state is given up in RQM. In
this sense, the interpretation of the wave function in the context of
RQM is akin the interpretation of the Hamilton-Jacobi functional in
classical mechanics: a theoretical tool to facilitate the computation
of the probabilities of future events on the basis of certain given
knowledge about a certain state of affairs. The relation between the
wave function \(\psi\) and the Hamilton-Jacobi functional \(S\) is
more than an analogy, because in the semiclassical approximation the
later approximates the first \((\psi \sim \exp iS/\hslash)\). This
mathematical relation can be taken as an argument against a strongly
realistic readings of \(\psi\), for the following reason. The
interpretation of a quantity A in the mathematical apparatus of a
physical theory must be consisten with the interpretation of the
quantity A reduces to in an approximation. The Hamilton-Jacobi
functions of, say, a classical particle has no strongly realistic
interpretation. The Hamilton-Jacobi function we explicitly use in
calculations collapses and jumps with what we learn about the system,
as does the quantum wave function.</p>

<p>
Voiding the quantum states of its strongly realistic interpretation
gives away with the mystery of quantum jumps and collapses. The fact
that RQM state is relative to a system explains why it can jump as the
two systems act on one another. </p>

<p>
In classical mechanics we can dispense of the Hamilton-Jacobi
functional. This testifies for its lack of direct ontological weight.
We can equally dispense with \(\psi\) in quantum theory. Evidence of
this is that the full early development of the quantum mechanical
formalisms (Heisenberg 1925; Born &amp; Jordan 1925; Dirac 1925; Born,
Heisenberg, &amp; Jordan 1926) predates the work where \(\psi\) was
introduced (Schr&ouml;dinger 1926). Quantum mechanics can be
formulated without reference to the quantum state, as a theory of
probabilities for sequences of events. The state \(\psi\) is a
convenient tool, not a necessary one.</p>

<p>
Heilbron and Rovelli (2023) argue that Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s
development of wave mechanics, in spite of its wide utility, can be
seen as conceptually misleading, because it has promoted a mistaken
overemphasis of the ontological role of \(\psi\) .</p>


<h3 id="QuanSupeCatHalfDeadHalfAliv">1.5. Quantum superposition: can a cat be half dead, half alive?</h3>

<p>
If \(\psi'\) and \(\psi''\) are two orthogonal quantum states of a
system, quantum mechanics assumes that the system can also be in the
state \(\psi = (\psi' +\psi'')/\sqrt{2}\). This is the superposition
principle, a cornerstone of the theory (Dirac 1930). If \(\psi'\) is
the state of a live cat and \(\psi''\) the state of a dead cat, then
\(\psi\) is a state in which the cat is in a quantum superposition of
dead and alive; the theory predicts that this is a possible (relative)
state of a cat. What does RQM say about situations such as this? Is
the cat in some sense half alive and half dead?</p>

<p>
The existence of states like \(\psi =(\psi' +\psi'')/\sqrt{2}\)does
not mean that we &ldquo;see superpositions&rdquo; (as sometimes
wrongly stated): what we &ldquo;see&rdquo;, namely what we measure,
according to textbook quantum theory, are eigenvalues of self-adjoint
operators, not quantum states. Measured eigenvalues are always
univocal, never &ldquo;superimposed&rdquo;. To be a superposition,
rather, means two things. First, that if an observable has value
\(a'\) in \(\psi'\) and value \(a''\) in \(\psi''\) then any
observation of the system will give either \(a'\) or \(a''\), each
with probability 1/2. Second, the probability distribution of the
outcomes of the measurement of any observable that is not diagonal in
the \((\psi'\), \(\psi''\)) basis will be affected by interference:
that is, it will not be the mean of the average values of the
observable in \(\psi'\) and \(\psi''\). In RQM, this and nothing else
is the meaning of being in a quantum superposition.</p>

<p>
We never see cats that are half alive and half dead because quantum
theory predicts that we never see this sort of things. It predicts
that we see cats either alive or dead. It also predicts that in
principle we should be able to see interference effect between the two
states. These interference effects are strongly suppressed by
decoherence in the case of macroscopic systems (like cats), hence the
theory actually predicts that they are extremely hard to observe, in
agreement with experience. A puzzle, on the other hand, appears if we
ask what the cat itself would perceive when we describe it in quantum
superposition. Say the brain of the cat measures whether its heart is
beating or not. The theory predicts that the brain will find either
that it does or that it does not. In textbook quantum mechanics, this
implies a collapse of \(\psi\) to either \(\psi'\) or \(\psi''\). In
turns, this implies that no further effects of interference between
these two states will happen. And <em>this</em> conclusion contradicts
the existence of interference effects (although small due to
decoherence) predicted by quantum theory. <em>This</em> problem is
resolved by RQM. It is solved by the Main Assumption: the way the cat,
a quantum system, affects an external system, is <em>not</em> affected
by the specific way the heart of the cat has affected its brain.</p>

<p>
That is, the state of the cat with respect to the external world does
not collapse when a part of the cat interacts with another.</p>

<h2 id="RelaIssu">2. Related Issues</h2>

<h3 id="Info">2.1 Information</h3>

<p>
The early presentations of RQM were formulated in the language of
information theory. They were at the roots of the later development of
the use of information theory to make sense of quantum theory (Calosi
and Riedel 2024). The quantum state is a way of coding the information
that an observing system \(S'\) may have about a quantum system \(S\),
relevant for predicting future ways \(S\) can affect \(S'\). This
information is determined by the ways \(S\) has affected \(S'\) in the
past. Furthermore, the hope was presented in (Rovelli 1996) that a
full reconstruction of the quantum formalism on the basis of simple
informational postulates was possible. Two main postulates were
proposed:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(i)</span><span class="sen"> relevant
information is finite for a system with compact phase space,
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(ii)</span><span class="sen"> new information
can always be acquired. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The two postulates are not in contradiction with each other because
when new information is gathered some previously relevant information
becomes irrelevant. &ldquo;Relevant&rdquo; here means that it affects
future probabilities. A moment of reflection shows that first
postulate implies the characteristic discreteness of quantum theory,
while the second is implied by Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainties.
Similar ideas were independently considered by Zeilinger and Bruckner
(Zeilinger 1999; Brukner &amp; Zeilinger 2003).</p>

<p>
As emphasized in Dorato (2017), information is best not understood as
a primary notion. It must be defined physically in terms of something
else; as such, it can play an important notion in &ldquo;theories of
principle&rdquo; in the sense of Einstein (1919). In RQM, the
information is defined relationally as relative information (in the
sense of Shannon) that a physical system has about another system.
Relative information is physical correlation between two systems,
namely a measure of the difference between the possible number of
states of the combined system and the product of the number of states
of the two systems, due to the existence of physical constraints.
Thus, we say that a variable \(O_A\) of a system has information about
a variable \(A\) of another system iff the values that \(A\) and
\(O_A\)can take are correlated. In this case the outcome of a
measurment of \(O_A\) predicts the outcome of a measurement of \(A\),
that is, in this sense, &ldquo;\(O_A\)has information about
\(A\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In the spirit of Shannon, this is a weak definition of information
that has no mentalistic, semantic, or cognitive aspects. The
informational perspective of the early work in RQM has influenced the
development of numerous later information theoretical approaches to
the foundations of quantum theory, as well as a number of later
attempts to derive the quantum formalism of the theory from physically
transparent postulates. For an idiosycratic and a bit rambling, but
with intersting insights, account of the state of this program see
(Stacey 2021 [Other Internet Resources]).</p>

<h3 id="Disc">2.2 Discreteness</h3>

<p>
Discreteness is not an accessory aspect of quantum theory: it is its
most characteristic feature (it gives the theory its name).
Discreteness appears in two related ways in quantum theory.</p>

<p>
First, the amount of information that can be gathered regarding the
state of a system which is in a finite region R of its phase space is
finite. For each degree of freedom, it is given by the Liouville
measure of R divided by the Planck constant. This is what causes
discrete spectra. Continuous spectra require infinite phase spaces,
and can be seen as effects of idealisations. The discreteness of
quantum mechanics is therefore expressed by the first of the two
informational postulates.</p>

<p>
Second, quantum mechanics describes the world in terms of values of
variables at specific discrete times. This second aspect of
discreteness is directly accounted for by the sparse ontology of RQM.
The history of a quantum particle, for instance, is neither a
continuous line in spacetime (as in classical mechanics), nor a
continuous wave function on spacetime. Rather, with respect to any
other system it is a discrete set of interactions, each localized in
spacetime.</p>

<p>
The discrete ontology of RQM seems to raise a difficulty: what
determines the <em>timing</em> for the events to happen? The problem
is the difficulty of establishing a specific moment when, say, a
measurement happens. The question is addressed in Rovelli (1998),
observing that quantum mechanics itself does give a (probabilistic)
prediction on when a measurement happens. This is because the meaning
of the question whether or not a measurement has happened is to
ascertain whether of not a pointer variable \(O_A\) in the observing
system \(S\) has become properly correlated with (namely, &ldquo;has
information about&rdquo;) the variable \(A\) of the system \(A\). In
turn, this is a physical question that makes sense because it can be
posed empirically by measuring \(A\) and \(O_A\) and checking if they
are consistent. On the regress that this determines, see Section 3.3
below. </p>

<h3 id="CompOtheInte">2.3 Comparison with other interpretations</h3>

<p>
<em>Textbook</em> &ldquo;<em>Copenhagen</em>&rdquo;: To a good extent
RQM is a completion of the standard textbook interpretation. The
difference is that the latter assumes the existence of a classical
world, or a classical observer, and describes the way quantum systems
affect it in an interaction. The relational interpretation, on the
contrary, assumes that an account of these interactions is valid with
respect to any physical system. Thus, RQM is a sort of
&ldquo;democratised&rdquo; version of Copenhagen, where some (but not
all) roles of the single observer can be assumed by any physical
system. These are sufficient to define a consistent interpretation,
without need of the decohetence and the dissipation required by
conventional quantum measurements. From the perspective of RQM, the
textbook interpretation emerges when there is sufficent decoherence.
</p>

<p>
<em>Many Worlds</em>: Both RQM and the Many Worlds interpretation (see
Vaidman 2018) are rooted in the work of Everett (1957). Both attempt
to solve the mystery of quantum theory by adding a level of
indexicality. In RQM, variables have values with respect to other
physical systems. In Many Worlds, variables have values with respect
to branches of the universal wave function. In neither interpretations
there is any a priori special role for measurement, or observers. The
main difference is the distinct ontological commitment: the Many
Worlds interpretation is based on the assumption that all relative
states are branches of a unique universal wave function, interpreted
as a real entity, which obeys a single deterministic evolution law.
The Many Worlds interpretation must work to recover Heisenberg
uncertainty (via branch indexicality), probabilities (via subjective
interpretation of probability), and discreteness, from this unique,
deterministic, continuous universal wave function. RQM has all this
easily in its foundation. On the other hand, the Many Worlds
interpretation is based on a (according to some, inflated, but)
no-nonsense realist metaphysics, which is precluded by the
perspectivism of RQM. The two can perhaps made closer by the simple
observation that modality can always be transformed into multiple
world realism <em>&agrave; la</em> Lewis (1986), trading actuality for
indexicality.</p>

<p>
<em>Hidden variables</em> (Bohm): Hidden variable theories, of which
Bohm theory (Bohm 1952) is the best available example, provide a
realistic and deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics. The
similarity between RQM and Bohm theory is in the realistic
interpretation of some variables, such as the position of a particle.
The differences are two. The first is that on the Bohm theory it is
position that always has a definite value, whereas, on RQM, what
variable acquires a value in an interaction depends on the nature of
the interaction. The second is that on the Bohm theory position always
has a definite value, which changes in a continuous manner, whereas,
on RQM, the ontology has the sparseness already discussed. In RQM
there is no analog of the extra equation assumed in Bohm theory.
Drezet (2024) has discussed the relation between Bohm theory and RQM.
</p>

<p>
<em>Physical collapse</em>: Physical collapse theories like Ghirardi,
Rimini, and Weber (1986) and Penrose (1996) are physically
distinguishable from standard QM, which is instead assumed to be
correct up to contrary empirical indications, in RQM.</p>

<p>
There are interpretations of quantum mechanics that are close to the
relational one:</p>

<p>
<em>Zeilinger-Bruckner</em>: The Relational Interpretation is close to
the view of quantum theory held developed by Zeilinger and Bruckner;
in particular, similar postulates to the original ones of RQM were
independently proposed in (Zeilinger 1999, Brukner &amp; Zeilinger
2003). These ideas generated some of the interesting mathematical work
aiming at making the derivation of the formalism of quantum theory
from information theoretical postulates precise. For versions of this
program related to RQM see (Grinbaum 2005; H&ouml;hn 2017; H&ouml;hn
&amp; Wever 2017).</p>

<p>
<em>QBism</em>: The emphasis on information in Rovelli (1996)
influenced the birth of QBism (see Fuchs 1998: 3, 2001, 2002 [Other
Internet Resources]). There are similarities between RQM and QBism
(Pienaar 2021b). One similarity is the emphasis on dropping questions
considered meaningless. The second is the use of the language of
information theory (Spekkens 2014). The difference is mostly in the
way the subject holding information is treated. In QBism the ideas of
<em>agent</em> and <em>experience</em> are fundamental (DeBrota 2018
[Other Internet Resources]), while these ideas play no role in RQM. In
RQM, the subject is fully naturalised: it is itself considered a
physical system that can be described by quantum theory. This leads to
a stronger version of realism that QBism, and to the emphasis on the
relational aspect of all variables. In QBism the emphasis is in the
information about the world held by a single subject, taken as
primary. In RQM, the information is relative information (in the sense
of Shannon) that a physical system has about another system; it is not
primary (see Dorato 2017): it is can be simply understood physically
as a correlation between the two systems that can be observed by a
third system. Steven French (2024, 2024b) has framed the relation
between QBism and RQM in terms of the two versions of perspetivalism
(&lsquo;perspectival<sub>1</sub>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;perspectival<sub>2</sub>&rsquo;) considered by Michela
Massimi&rsquo;s Perspectival realism (Massimi 2022).</p>

<p>
<em>Richard Healey</em>: Healey&rsquo;s pragmatist approach (Healey
1989) has in common with RQM the idea that the quantum state is not a
description of physical reality, not even incompletely. Its main
function is to be a (dispensable) tool for computing probabilities.
The main difference is the emphasis on what quantum states are
relative to. For Healey&rsquo;s pragmatist view, a quantum state
ascription is relative <em>only</em> to the perspective of an actual
or potential agent (Healey 2012). In RQM, values are relative to any
physical system. Restricting quantum theory to its use by agents is
not a concern for Healey&rsquo;s pragmatist philosophy; it is more so
in a naturalistic perspective searching for an understanding of Nature
that remains significative also where no agents are around. This is
the same difference as between RQM and QBism, but Healey&rsquo;s
position is closer to RQM than QBism because while the QBism&rsquo;s
quantum state ascriptions depend on the epistemic state of the agent,
for Healey the quantum state ascribed to a system depends only on the
physical circumstances defining the perspective of the agent.</p>

<p>
<em>Phenomenology</em>: Steven French discusses RQM from a
phenomenological perspective (2024b, 9.8) and observes that there is
the possibility of &ldquo;an interesting accommodation [or RQM] with
phenomenology&rdquo; (2024b, pg 226) if RQM drops the insistence that
an observer cannot assign a quantum state to themselves and the RQM
can accomodate conscious observers.</p>

<p>
<em>Cavalcanti&rsquo;s</em> &lsquo;<em>Experimental
metaphysics</em>&rsquo;<em>:</em> Cavalcanti&rsquo;s formalization of
the arguments connecting quantum predictions with general assumptions
about the world (Cavalcanti 2008 [Other Internet Resources]) lead to a
view very close to RQM. </p>

<h3 id="Repr">2.4 Representation</h3>

<p>
The issue of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is related to the
issue of the possibility of offering a <em>representation</em> in the
sense of an intuitive account of what happens in the world. It can be
useful to give a simple-minded pictorial representation of the
intuition sustaining different interpretations. Imagine at time
\(t_1\) a radioactive atom is surrounded by Geiger counters and at
time \(t_2\) one of the counters clicks, having detected a product of
the decay. What has happened during the \(t_1\)-\(t_2\) interval?</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>According to <em>textbook quantum theory</em>, the wave function
of a particle classically trapped in the nucleus leaks out of the
nucleus symmetrically, filling the space surrounding the nucleus. At
the moment of the detection this wave function magically disappears
everywhere except at the particular detector that clicks.</li>

<li>According to the <em>Many Worlds</em> interpretation, all
detectors click. In fact, each detector clicks at every moment of
time, but the wave function of the universe branches continuously into
innumerable branches: we, ourselves, happen to be in one particular
branch in which one particular detector clicks at one particular
time.</li>

<li>According to the <em>Bohmiam interpretation</em>, the wave
function equally leaks uniformly in space, but in the meanwhile the
associated particle, guided by this wave function, zigzags around,
until hitting a particular detector.</li>

<li>According to <em>Physical Collapse</em> interpretations, the wave
function also leaks out uniformly, but when its effect on the heavy
Geiger detectors begins to displace too much matter, the wave function
collapses as in the textbook interpretation, but driven by a
hypothetical dynamical process which has not yet been explicitly
observed (Ghirardi 2018).</li>

<li>What about <em>RQM</em>? In the spirit of Heisenberg, there is no
actual wave function out there in nature, nor there is any fact of the
matter about <em>the position of the particle respect to the Geiger
counter</em> at any moment between \(t_1\)and \(t_2\). The lack of
determination of variables in quantun theory, in particular in RQM,
has been discussed in (Calosi and Mariani 2020). However, there may be
other facts of the matter. For instance, <em>the position of the
particle respect to some air molecule along the way</em>. These, on
the other hand, <em>have no bearing</em> on the position of the
particle with respect to the Geiger counter, which actualises at time
\(t_2\). The probabilistic distribution of this position does not
depend on the position of the particle with respect to the air
molecules.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="FrauRennExpeLoca">2.5 Frauchiger-Renner experiment and locality</h3>

<p>
The Frauchiger-Renner thought-experiment (Frauchiger &amp; Renner
2018) can be read as an indirect support to RQM, since it makes
concrete the idea that &ldquo;different observers can give different
accounts of the same set of events&rdquo;, as in the original RQM
slogan. The experiment is discussed in the conceptual framework of RQM
by Waaijer and van Neerven (2019 [Other Internet Resources]). But if
course it can be accounted by all interpretations.</p>

<p>
The application of RQM to the EPR context and the problem of quantum
non locality has been initially discussed in Smerlak and Rovelli
(2007) and (Laudisa 2001). Some of the claims of the earlier
discussion about RQM being &ldquo;local&rdquo; have been questioned,
pointing out that RQM should in any case be &ldquo;forced to accept
<em>some</em> form of non-locality in quantum phenomena&rdquo;
(Laudisa 2019: 227). See also Pienaar&rsquo;s criticisms (2019) and
the discussion in Martin-Dussaud, Rovelli, and Zalamea (2019) and
(Martin-Dussaud 2021), where a specific sense in which quantum theory
is non-local from the RQM perspective is clarified.</p>

<h3 id="Soli">2.6 Solipsism?</h3>

<p>
Prima facie, RQM may seem to imply a form of perspectival solipsism
(Rovelli 2024 [Other Internet Resources]), as the values of variables
realized in the perspective of some system \(S\) are not necessarily
the same as those realized with respect to another system \(S'\).
However, often this is not the case, as follows directly from quantum
theory itself. The key is to observe that any physical comparison is
itself a quantum interaction. Suppose the variable \(A\) of \(S\) is
measured by \(S'\) and stored into the variable \(A'\) of \(S'\). This
means that the interaction has created a correlation between \(A\) and
\(A'\). In turn, this means that a third system measuring \(A\) and
\(A'\) will find consistent values. That is: the perspectives of
\(S'\) and \(S''\) agree on this regard, and this can be checked in a
physical interaction.</p>

<p>
For instance: imagine experimenter \(S'\) measures the spin of the
electron \(S\), and writes the value of this spin on a piece of paper.
In principle, experimenter \(S''\) can devise an experiment where she
can detect an effect due to interference between the two branches
where the spin of the electron (and the text) have one or the other
value. But if \(S''\) measures the spin and reads the piece of paper,
she will find that experimenter \(S'\) has seen the same spin as
herself.</p>

<p>
Why? Because quantum theory predicts so, as can be seen from the
following: with respect to \(S''\), the first interaction yields a
quantum state of the form</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
&amp; \ket{\text{spin up}} \times \ket{\text{paper with text } \lsq\text{spin up}\rsq} \\
 &amp; + \ket{\text{spin down}} \times \ket{\text{paper with text } \lsq\text{spin down}\rsq} 
\end{align} \]

<p>
Measuring the spin projects the state on one single branch of the two,
and both branches lead to consistency. Therefore, as long as we do not
chase subtle interference phenomena hidden behind decoherence, RQM
implies that we all &lsquo;see the same world&rsquo;. </p>

<h2 id="GeneComm">3. General Comments</h2>

<h3 id="ReacCrit">3.1 Reactions, criticisms, developments</h3>

<p>
Bas van Fraassen (2009) explores &ldquo;the world of quantum mechanics
as RQM depicts it&rdquo; (2010: 390), clarifying what is and what is
not relative to observers. He concentrates on the apparently
paradoxical aspects of RQM. The limits on information that observers
can have, which can only be acquired through physical interaction,
have surprising consequences for complex situations in which an
observer makes a measurement, a second observer makes measurements on
the first and its target, and even a third observer comes in and
observes a process involving the first two observers. Van Fraassen
concludes that all the consistency questions can be laid to rest, when
the situation&rsquo;s representation in RQM is properly understood. On
the other hand, he also observes that if in RQM what the state of a
system relative to an observer is, is not itself relative to anything,
then the question can be raised what relationships there are between
the state of a specific entangled system or its components relative to
different observers. He proposes and additional postulate, weakly
relating the description of the same system as given by different
observers, which forbids the possibility of disturbing inconsistencies
allowed by the multiplication of perspectives. The idea of adding a
postulate relating the description of the same system as given by
different observers has later been developed in Adlam &amp; Rovelli
(2023).</p>

<p>
Laura Candiotto (2017) argues that the best philosophical framework
for RQM is Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) (Ladyman&amp; Ross 2007;
French &amp; Ladyman 2011). Ontic structural realism is meant to be a
defensible form of scientific realism (Ladyman 2019); it argues for
the priority of relations over substances, as self-subsistent
individual objects (Morganti 2011). For Candiotto, RQM is a realistic
theory that assumes the notion of relation (the physical interaction
between systems and instruments) as primitive; objects emerge as
relational &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; (French 2006), or intersections of
processes. The lack of observer-independence is not inability of
providing an account of the structure of matter, because there are no
intrinsic properties that can be assigned to systems independently of
their interactions, therefore this structure is itself relational,
hence in particular observer dependent. Relations via dynamical
processes of information exchange can be taken as the building blocks
of the universe.</p>

<p>
The relation between RQM and ontic structural realism has been
emphasized also by Mauro Dorato (2016). Dorato gives an extensive
evaluation of RQM, pointing out its main characteristics. He
emphasises then two aspects that characterise RQM. The first is a
revisionary metaphysical account of quantum theory; that is: central
assumptions of common sense must go, if they contradict contemporary
physical theories. Here, what is abandoned is the presupposition that
quantum systems have a non-relational, intrinsic nature. RQM&rsquo;s
metaphysics is revisionary also for a second reason. Analogously to
the many-worlds interpretation, RQM does not suggest changing the
formalism of quantum theory&mdash;as alternative formulations of the
theory do&mdash;but rather, modifies the conceptual schemes with which
we can interpret the formalism, and consequently, our metaphysics.
Dorato observes that the relativisation of values implies a
relativisation of the very notion of object or entity, if (i) having
some intrinsic, non-purely dispositional properties is essential to
the identity of an object, and (ii) no entity can exist if it does not
have an intrinsic identity (see N&#257;g&#257;rjuna 1995). The only
reality in RQM is given by events, which are the result of
interactions between distinct quantum systems, but even these events
can be described in a different way by different physical systems. The
interaction cannot be described in a more precise way by a
constructive theory in Einstein&rsquo;s sense (Einstein 1919) that can
explain the coming into being of a definite outcome without just
assuming it as a fundamental fact. Dorato concludes that there is no
measurement problem in RQM because RQM is implicitly formulated as a
theory of principle. He also considers the issue of priority monism as
defined in Schaffer (2010): Shaffer claims that quantum
mechanics&rsquo; entanglement is evidence that the whole universe has
ontological priority with respect to its parts. Dorato point out that
the firm advocacy of relationalism of RQM has instead radical
anti-holistic consequences.</p>

<p>
The second characteristic aspect of RQM pointed out by Dorato is that,
consequently, the best way to capture the nature of not-yet
interacting quantum systems is to call into play a form of
dispositionalism: the only way to attribute some sort of intrinsicness
to the state-dependent properties of quantum systems is to attribute
them dispositions to manifest in a certain way according to the
interactions they are subject to. Dispositionalism is present in many
other views of quantum mechanics (Dorato 2006) but fits particularly
well in the context of RQM. Unlike Qbists interpretations of quantum
theory, which are agents-centered, in RQM the relation &ldquo;\(S\)
manifest \(q\) relative to \(S'\)&rdquo; is symmetric, and this is a
simple consequence of the hypothesis that in RQM quantum systems and
&ldquo;observers&rdquo; are on the same level. As a consequence of its
relational and dispositional aspect, Dorato stresses the fact that in
RQM there cannot be a universal flow of becoming, but only a local,
worldline-dependent and relational one. This still counts as a
relational form of becoming: no universal tide of coming into being,
but a crisscross of ripples. Since a physical system can exemplify a
given succession of events only relatively to another system and not
absolutely, in RQM there cannot be cosmic time, so that also in
general relativity temporal succession of events cannot be regarded as
a total order. In a sense, in RQM there is no quantum state of the
universe, or a God&rsquo;s eye point of view, since the cosmos can
only be described &ldquo;from within a given perspective&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Richard Healey has discussed RQM in two papers. In the first (2021),
he questions possibility of reconciling the observer-relativity of
measurement outcomes with a basic norm of scientific objectivity, in
the context of a quantum theory of gravity. In the second (2022), he
shifts to a more favorable view of main RQM thesis that the outcome of
a quantum measurement is to be viewed as a relative, not an absolute,
fact and he compares RQM to his pragmatist view of quantum theory. He
argues that the version of RQM in Adlam &amp; Rovelli 2023 solves his
previous main objection to RQM (that its ontology of relative facts is
incompatible with scientific objectivity and undercuts the evidential
base of quantum theory) and brings RQM and his pragmatist view into
even closer alignment.</p>

<p>
Steven French (2024) discusses the relation between RQM and the
&ldquo;continental philosophy&rdquo; account of quantum measurment
given by Fritz London and Edmund Bauer in 1939. Andrea Oldofredi
(2021) has argued that RQM is easily compatible with scientific
realism, in the context of an ontology of properties (Oldofredi 2021).
He has also discussed how precisely RQM solves the measurment problem
in (Oldofredi 2022). Juan Sebastian Ardenghi and Olimpia Lombardi
(2022) have discussed the relation between RQM and the
Modal&#8209;Hamiltonian Interpretation, arguing that the two
interpretation complement each other. In (Martin-Dussaud, 2023) a
mathematical formalisation of the notion of relative facts is
proposed.</p>

<h3 id="RelaReal">3.2 Relationality and realism</h3>

<p>
The central move of RQM is to interpret all physical variables as
relational, namely as referring to two systems, not a single one, and
to view them as realised only in interactions. Relationality has been
playing an ever dominant role as our knowledge of the natural world
has increased. Examples are the relational nature of velocity in
classical mechanics, of locality in general relativity, of the
potential in electromagnetism, of the gauge invariant observables in
non-abelian gauge theories, and many others. RQM is a long step
further in this direction. Taken seriously, the philosophical
implications of this overreaching relationally can be heavy. The main
one is a weakening of a strong version of realism.</p>

<p>
There is nothing in RQM that contradicts the assumption that the world
is &ldquo;out there&rdquo;, irrespectively of our mental states, or
perceptions. In this weak sense RQM is consistent with realism. But
RQM questions the assumption that each variables of each subsystem of
the world has a single value at each and every time. In this stronger
sense, realism is questioned by RQM. The ontology of RQM is a sparse
ontology of relational quantum events, not derived from any unique
&ldquo;underlying&rdquo; representation. This weakening of realism is
in a direction similar to what happened with Galilean or
Einstein&rsquo;s relativity, which have shown that there is no fact of
the matter in the velocity of a single object, or in the simultaneity
of two space like separated events alone.</p>

<p>
However, this is a radical step in this direction. In Laudisa (2019)
it is pointed out that RQM gives no deeper account, or underlying
dynamical representation, of the main process: the actualisation of
quantum events at interactions. This is the process which in textbook
quantum theory is called measurement and is accompanied by state
reduction. Quantum mechanics gives probabilities for quantum events to
happen, not a story representing how they happen. This core aspect of
quantum theory is not resolved in RQM: it is taken as a fact of the
world. What RQM does resolve is the question of when this happens: any
time one system affects another one, it happens relative to this other
system. What RQM does, is to show that this is not in contradiction
with the existence of interference effects. But the core discreteness
of the quantum event actualisation is not &ldquo;explained&rdquo; in
RQM: it is understood as the picture of how nature works according to
quantum theory. This can be understood to be in spirit of
Newton&rsquo;s famous observation &ldquo;whatever is not deduced from
the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether
metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical,
have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy
particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and
afterwards rendered general by induction&rdquo; (Newton 1713).</p>

<p>
The radicality of the step implied by RQM has been emphasized by
Timotheus Riedel (2024). Riedel emphasizes the fact that RQM is
necessarilly committed to an &ldquo;unrestricted iteration
principle&rdquo;, according to which facts about what the facts are
from some particular perspective are themselves perspective-dependent,
and so on <em>ad inf</em>. This principle plays a crucial role in
ensuring the communicability and coherence of events across
perspectives, but is incompatible with the orthodox reading of
relativity in terms of relationality, and instead requires adoption of
a notion of perspectival facts. This follows from the fact that in RQM
to say that a system \(S'\) has information about a system \(S\) is is
itself a contingent property of the coupled system (\(S, S'\)), and as
such it can only be relative to some system (possibly \(S'\) itself).
Concretely, this situation can be physically realized when a
measurment happens only if a certain quantum out come is realized,
namely in the case of a superposition between a situation in which a
measurmenet has happened and one in which it hasn&rsquo;t. Hence RQM
assumes that there is no absolute meaning to a propsotion like Fact E
has obtained. The viability of this radical persectivism (including
its RQM version) has been recently discussed by Peter Evans (2020) in
a paper with the title <em>Perspectival objectivity Or: how I learned
to stop worrying and love observer-dependent reality.</em></p>

<p>
This weakening of realism is the &ldquo;price to pay&rdquo; for the
relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. It can be compared
with the &ldquo;price to pay&rdquo; in other interpretations, such as
the inflated ontology and the distance between the ontology and the
world as we see it of the Many Worlds interpretation, the existence of
variables unobservables in principle and the loss of Lorentz
invariance of Bohm theory, and so on.</p>

<p>
An alternative to this radical perspectivalism is to reduce it to
relativism (Riedel 2024), namely to assume that values of variables
are relative, but the fact that a variable has relative to a system is
an absolute fact, which by itself is not relative to anything. Namely
to assume that the actualization of each unique quantum event is a
fundamental absolute physical event. This tamed version of RQM is
often implicitly assumed by commentators, and criticised. Jacques
Pienaar (2021) has given a sharp version of these criticisms in the
form of five no-go theorems indicating that the balancing act between
relative values and absolute actualization of quantum event cannot be
sustanied. Related criticisms where raised in (Muci&ntilde;o 2022) and
(Lawrence 2023). Responses, pointing to the fact that these papers
contain implicit assumptions rejected in RQM, were given in (Rovelli
2021b [Other Internet Resources], Di Biagio &amp; Rovelli 2022 and
Cavalcanti 2023).</p>

<p>
The other side of the coin of each &ldquo;price to pay&rdquo; is the
lesson we might gather from the empirical success of quantum theory:
for the Many Worlds interpretation, for instance, the lesson is the
real existence of other branches, for Bohm theory is the real
existence of unobservable variables that pick a preferred reference
frame, and so on. For RQM, the lesson of quantum theory is that the
description of the way distinct physical systems affect each other
when they interact (and not the way physical systems
&lsquo;are&rsquo;) exhausts all that can be said about the physical
world. The physical world must be described as a net of interacting
components, where there is no meaning to &lsquo;the state of an
isolated system&rsquo;, or the value of the variables of an isolated
system. The state of a physical system is the net of the relations it
entertains with the surrounding systems. The physical structure of the
world is identified as this net of relationships. The notion of
substance that plays a major role in western philosophy might be
inappropriate to account for this science; perhaps the idea of a
&ldquo;mutual dependency&rdquo; (N&#257;g&#257;rjuna 1995) may offer a
relevant philosophical cadre (Rovelli 2021).</p>

<h3><a name="DebaCrosPers">3.3 The debate on the cross perspective link</a></h3>

<p>
Emily Adlam (2022) has argued that interpretations of quantum
mechanics that deny observer-independence challenge our presumption of
intersubjectivity regarding measurement outcomes and this can undemine
the possibility of the scentific project itself, which is based on the
possibility of such agreement. She argues that such observers are
unable to escape their own perspective in order to learn anything
about the perspectives of other observers and therefore be unable to
confirm the theory. The challenge has motivated her and Rovelli to add
to RQM a specific postulate about the relation between perspevctves
(Adlam &amp; Rovelli 2023). They consider a &lsquo;Cross-Perspective
Link&rsquo; postulate, which states that the measurement of a
system&rsquo;s pointer accurately reveals the outcome said system has
registered in an earlier interaction (unless the pointer has been
tampered with). This axiom stipulates the possibility of communication
across viewpoints.</p>

<p>
There are two ways to interpret this postulate. It can be interpreted
strongly, as an absolute statment about a relation between
perspectives. Alternatively, it can be interpreted weakly, as a
statement about what can be ascertained by a (possibly further)
observer. In thsi case, the postulate leads only to the consistency of
physical communication implied by the quantum formalism discussed in
2.6 above.</p>

<p>
The strong interpretation assumes that it is possible to take the
ensemble of all perspectives realistically by &ldquo;regard[ing] the
pointlike quantum events or &lsquo;flashes&rsquo; as absolute,
observer-independent facts about reality&rdquo; [Adlam &amp; Rovelli
2023, Adlam 2024], even if this ensemble is not acessible in principle
to anybody. Whether this option is a viable in RQM is an open
question. It is challenged for instance by Riedel (2024)
&ldquo;unrestricted iteration principle&rdquo;, and by specific no-go
theorems (Pienaar 2021). Blake Stacey (2022 [Other Internet
Resources]) has argued that the strong interpretation is step backs
away from the perspectivalism that characterizes the interpretation:
it is &ldquo;a disguised form of the projection postulate leading to a
&lsquo;global collapse&rsquo; of the state of the interacting
pair&rdquo; (Lahti and Pelonpa&#776;a&#776; 2023).</p>

<p>
Interpreted weakly, the postulate is sufficient to guarantee the
intersubjectivity between agents that enjoy a common decoherece
domain. They can pile up a sufficient number of facts that are stable
in the sense of (DiBiagio and Rovelli 2021) and develop rational
science by noticing probabilistic regularities and by induection, and
therefore develop and test physical laws. A community of scientific
perception in agreement as to what constitutes the object of the
investigation is therefore compatible with RQM ven in its full
perspectival version. On the other hand, this is not sufficient to
close off the possibility that with respect to a further observer
external to this community the entire contingent world specifically
described by current science could be just a term in a quantum
superposition. So interpreted, RQM does not challenge the rationality
of the scientific enterpreise, but <em>does</em> undermine the
possibility of ascertaining facts as absolutely true. Taken in this
sense, RQM interprets quantum phenomena as an invitation to a radical
perspectivalism: with respect to some observer, we can always be like
Friend is for Wigner. For a recent extensive discussion of these
alteratives, see the <em>Foundation of Physics</em> Special Issue on
RQM and especially the introduction by Calosi and Riedel (2024).</p>
