<p>
The laden phrase &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; has come to signify a
wide range of political activity and theorizing founded in the shared
experiences of injustice of members of certain social groups. Rather
than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos,
or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to
secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized
within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or
reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge
dominant characterizations, with the goal of greater
self-determination.</p>

<h2 id="HistScop">1. History and Scope</h2>

<p>
The second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of
large-scale political movements&mdash;second wave feminism, Black
Civil Rights in the U.S., gay and lesbian liberation, and the American
Indian movements, for example&mdash;based in claims about the
injustices done to particular social groups. These social movements
are undergirded by and foster a philosophical body of literature that
takes up questions about the nature, origin and futures of the
identities being defended. Identity politics as a mode of organizing
is intimately connected to the idea that some social groups are
oppressed; that is, that one&rsquo;s identity as a woman or as African
American, for example, makes one peculiarly vulnerable to cultural
imperialism (including stereotyping, erasure, or appropriation of
one&rsquo;s group identity), violence, exploitation, marginalization,
or powerlessness (Young 1990). Identity politics starts from analyses
of such forms of social injustice to recommend, variously, the
reclaiming, redescription, or transformation of previously stigmatized
accounts of group membership. Rather than accepting the negative
scripts offered by a dominant culture about one&rsquo;s own
inferiority, one transforms one&rsquo;s own sense of self and
community. For example, in their germinal statement of identity
politics, articulated through a Black feminist tradition, the Combahee
River Collective argued that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
as children we realized that we were different from boys and that we
were treated different&mdash;for example, when we were told in the
same breath to be quiet both for the sake of being
&lsquo;ladylike&rsquo; and to make us less objectionable in the eyes
of white people. In the process of consciousness-raising, actually
life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences
and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics
that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression. (1982,
14&ndash;15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The scope of political movements that may be described as identity
politics is broad: the examples used in the philosophical literature
are predominantly of struggles for recognition and social justice by
groups of citizens within western capitalist democracies, but
Indigenous rights movements worldwide, nationalist projects, or
demands for regional self-determination use similar arguments.
Predictably, there is no straightforward criterion that makes a
political struggle into an example of &ldquo;identity politics.&rdquo;
Rather, the term signifies a loose collection of political projects,
each undertaken by representatives of a collective with a
distinctively different social location that has hitherto been
neglected, erased, or suppressed. It is beyond the scope of this essay
to offer historical or sociological surveys of the many different
social movements that might be described as identity politics,
although references to this literature are provided in the
bibliography; instead the focus here is to provide an overview of the
philosophical issues in the expansive literature in political
theory.</p>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; is also something of a
philosophical punching-bag and increasingly a term of political abuse.
Since the twentieth-century heyday of the well-known political
movements that made identity politics so visible, a vast academic
literature has sprung up; although &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; can
draw on intellectual precursors from Mary Wollstonecraft to Frantz
Fanon, writing that actually uses this specific phrase, with any of
its contemporary baggage, does not begin until the late 1970s. Hence
the articulation of political projects that embrace a
self-understanding as &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; is more or less
concomitant with deployments of the term that use it as a negative
short-hand to gesture to an opposing position. As updated versions of
this article have appeared over the last 25 years, this latter
phenomenon has become both more marked and more diversified:
&ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; (critically and sometimes scornfully
inflected) can be intended to capture a form of virtue-signaling that
unfairly privileges women and racialized people at the expense of
white men while inhibiting freedom of expression; or, especially in
extra-academic political discourse, simply a kind of unspecified
defense of interest groups that undermines nation-building, cultural
cohesion, or tradition. For some critics, identity politics is the
enemy of liberal ideals, while for others it is liberalism&rsquo;s
savior. From a different political direction it can be a constellation
of imperatives with valuable motives that has nonetheless been subject
to &ldquo;elite capture,&rdquo; or a politics that ignores class
formation and neglects to challenge structural inequalities emerging
from neoliberalism and global capitalism. Further, the very emphasis
on human selves and their assorted group affiliations that identity
politics presumes is no longer clearly at the center of political
philosophy. Hence while social movements that draw on traditions in
anti-racism, Indigenous resurgence, feminism, queer politics, or
disability activism have hardly waned, it has become much harder to
find defenders of self-described &ldquo;identity politics,&rdquo; and
hence it has also become more difficult to articulate it in
contra-distinction to its detractors.</p>

<h2 id="PhilIden">2. Philosophy and Identity</h2>

<p>
From this brief examination of how identity politics fits into the
political landscape it is already clear that the use of the
controversial term &ldquo;identity&rdquo; raises a host of
philosophical questions. Logical uses aside, it is likely familiar to
philosophers from the literature in metaphysics on personal
identity&mdash;one&rsquo;s sense of self and its persistence. Indeed,
underlying many of the more overtly pragmatic debates about the merits
of identity politics are philosophical questions about the nature of
subjectivity and the self (Taylor 1989; Heyes 2007; Butler 2015).
Charles Taylor has argued that the modern identity is characterized by
an emphasis on its inner voice and capacity for
<em>authenticity</em>&mdash;that is, the ability to find a way of
being that is somehow true to oneself (Taylor 1994). While doctrines
of equality press the notion that each human being is capable of
deploying their practical reason or moral sense to live an authentic
life qua individual, the politics of difference has appropriated the
language of authenticity to describe ways of living that are true to
the identities of marginalized social groups. As Sonia Kruks puts
it:</p>

<blockquote>
What makes identity politics a significant departure from earlier,
pre-identarian forms of the politics of recognition is its demand for
recognition on the basis of the very grounds on which recognition has
previously been denied: it is <em>qua</em> women, <em>qua</em> blacks,
<em>qua</em> lesbians that groups demand recognition. The demand is
not for inclusion within the fold of &ldquo;universal humankind&rdquo;
on the basis of shared human attributes; nor is it for respect
&ldquo;in spite of&rdquo; one&rsquo;s differences. Rather, what is
demanded is respect for oneself <em>as</em> different (2001, 85).
</blockquote>

<p>
What is crucial about the &ldquo;identity&rdquo; of identity politics
appears to be the experience of the subject, especially their
experience within social structures that generate injustice, and the
possibility of a shared and more self-determined alternative. Thus
identity politics rests on the connection between a certain undergoing
and the subject-position to which it is attributed, and hence on
unifying claims about the meaning of politically laden experiences to
diverse individuals. Sometimes the meaning given to a particular
experience will diverge from that of its subject: thus, for example,
the victim of sexual violence who is told they caused their own fate
by taking risks, when they believe their attacker is culpable. Making
sense of such interpretive gaps depends on methods that recognize the
divergence between dominant epistemic accounts and subjugated
knowledges (Alcoff 2018). Thus concern about this aspect of identity
politics has crystallized around the transparency of experience, and
the univocality of its interpretation. Experience is never, critics
argue, simply epistemically available prior to interpretation (Scott
1992); rather it requires a theoretical framework&mdash;implicit or
explicit&mdash;to give it meaning (Heyes 2020) or to bridge the gap
between experience and critique (McNay 2022). Moreover, if experience
is the origin of politics, then some critics worry that what Kruks
(2001) calls &ldquo;an epistemology of provenance&rdquo; will become
the norm: on this view, political perspectives gain legitimacy by
virtue of their articulation by subjects of particular experiences.
This, critics charge, closes off the possibility of critique of these
perspectives by those who don&rsquo;t share the experience, which in
turn inhibits political dialogue and coalition-building. Nonetheless,
skepticism about the possibility of experience outside a hermeneutic
frame has been juxtaposed (or even reconciled) with phenomenological
attempts to articulate a ground for experience in the lived body
(Alcoff 2000; see also Oksala 2004 and 2011; Stoller 2009; Heyes
2020), or in related accounts of complex embodiment (Siebers 2017).
Recent work in Black feminist philosophy has also returned to identity
political language by seeking to ground political perspectives in
storytelling: for example, Kristie Dotson (2018) argues that a Black
feminism starting from personal narrative provides a practice that can
undercut unknowing in settler colonial contexts.</p>

<p>
From these understandings of subjectivity, it is easy to see how
critics of identity politics, and even some cautious supporters, have
wondered how it can meet the challenges of <em>intersectionality</em>
(Hill Collins and Bilge 2016). Intersectionality is both an ontology
and a method, with origins in women of color feminisms, especially
Black feminisms (Crenshaw 1989, 1990; Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 2013;
Hancock 2016; Bilge 2020; Carastathis 2023). Its central tenet is that
no axis of identity can be understood as separable from
others&mdash;whether in terms of individual experience or the
political structures that underlie social stratification. To speak of
&ldquo;people of color&rdquo; without distinguishing between class,
gender, sexuality, national and ethnic contexts, for example, is to
risk representing the experience of only some of the group&rsquo;s
members&mdash;typically those who are most privileged. To the extent
that identity politics urges mobilization around a single axis, it
will put pressure on participants to identify that axis as their
defining feature, when in fact they may well understand themselves as
integrated selves who cannot be represented so selectively or
reductively (Carastathis 2017). Generalizations made about particular
social groups in the context of identity politics may also come to
have a disciplinary function within the group, not just describing but
also dictating the self-understanding that its members should have.
Thus, the supposedly liberatory new identity may inhibit autonomy, as
Kwame Anthony Appiah puts it, replacing &ldquo;one kind of tyranny
with another&rdquo; (1994, 163). Just as dominant groups in the
culture at large insist that the marginalized integrate by
assimilating to dominant norms, so within some practices of identity
politics dominant sub-groups may, in theory and practice, impose their
vision of the group&rsquo;s identity onto all its members.</p>

<p>
For example, a common narrative of U.S. feminist history points to
universalizing claims made on behalf of women during the so-called
&ldquo;second wave&rdquo; of the feminist movement in the late 1960s
and 1970s. The most often discussed (and criticized) second wave
feminist icons&mdash;women such as Betty Friedan or Gloria
Steinem&mdash;are white, middle-class, and heterosexual, although this
historical picture itself too often neglects the contributions of
lesbian feminists, feminists of color, and working-class feminists,
which were less visible in popular culture, perhaps, but equally
influential in the lives of women. For some early radical feminists,
women&rsquo;s oppression <em>as women</em> was the core of identity
politics and should not be diluted with other identity issues. For
example, Shulamith Firestone, in her classic book <em>The Dialectic of
Sex</em>, argued that &ldquo;<em>racism is sexism
extended</em>,&rdquo; and that the Black Power movement represented
only sexist cooptation of Black women into a new kind of subservience
to Black men. Thus for Black women to fight racism (especially among
white women) was to divide the feminist movement, which properly
focused on challenging patriarchy, understood as struggle between men
and women, the foundational dynamic of all oppressions (Firestone
1970: esp. 103&ndash;120).</p>

<p>
Such claims about the universality of gender have therefore been
extensively criticized in feminist theory for failing to recognize the
specificity of their own constituencies. Friedan&rsquo;s famous
proposition that women needed to get out of the household and into the
professional workplace was, bell hooks pointed out, predicated on the
experience of a post-war generation of white, middle-class married
women limited to housekeeping and child-rearing by their professional
husbands (Friedan 1963; hooks 1981). Many women of color and
working-class women had worked outside their homes (sometimes in
<em>other</em> women&rsquo;s homes) for decades; some lesbians had a
history of working in traditionally male occupations or living
alternative domestic lives without a man&rsquo;s &ldquo;family
wage.&rdquo; Theorizing the experience of hybridity for those whose
identities are especially far from norms of univocality, Gloria
Anzald&uacute;a, for example, writes of her <em>mestiza</em> identity
as a Chicana, American, raised poor, a lesbian and a feminist, living
in the metaphoric and literal Borderlands of the American Southwest
(1999 [1987]). Some women from the Global South have been critical of
Northern feminist theory for falsely globalizing its claims. Such
moves construct &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; women, they argue, as less
developed or enlightened versions of their &ldquo;First World&rdquo;
counterparts, rather than understanding their distinctively different
situation (Mohanty 1991 [1984]); or, they characterize liberation for
Northern women in ways that exacerbate the exploitation of the global
poor&mdash;by supporting economic conditions in which increasing
numbers of western women can abuse migrant domestic workers, for
example (Anderson 2000). The question of what a global feminism should
make of identity political claims, or how it should conceive
solidarity among women from massively different locations within the
global economic system remains open (Weir 2008).</p>

<p>
Further complicating intersectional methods, the very categories of
identity that are taken to intersect may themselves be thought of as
historically contingent and variable. To take the example of
&ldquo;race,&rdquo; despite a complex history of biological
essentialism in the presentation of racial typologies, the notion of a
genetic basis to racial difference has been largely discredited; the
criteria different societies (at different times) use to organize and
hierarchize &ldquo;racial formations&rdquo; are political and
contingent (Omi and Winant 1994 [1986]). While some human physical
traits are in a trivial sense genetically determined, the grouping of
different persons into <em>races</em> does not pick out any patterned
biological difference. What it does pick out is a set of social
meanings with political ramifications (Alcoff 1997, 2006). The most
notorious example of an attempt to rationalize racial difference as
biological is the U.S. &ldquo;one-drop rule,&rdquo; under which an
individual was characterized as Black if they had &ldquo;one
drop&rdquo; or more of &ldquo;Black blood.&rdquo; Adrian Piper points
out that not only does this belief persist into contemporary readings
of racial identity, it also implies that given the prolonged history
of racial mixing in the US&mdash;both coerced and voluntary&mdash;very
significant numbers of nominally &ldquo;white&rdquo; people in the
U.S. today should be re-classified as &ldquo;Black&rdquo; (Piper
1996). In those countries that have had official racial
classifications, individuals&rsquo; struggles to be re-classified
(almost always as a member of a more privileged racial group) are
often invoked to highlight the contingency of race, especially at the
borders of its categories. And the history of groups such as the Irish
who, arguably, changed from being considered non-white to being
considered white in the US (Ignatiev 1995), illustrates a genealogical
thesis about who counts as white. Following Foucault (1978), a
<em>genealogical thesis</em> is one in which a claim about the
ontological priority of identity is recast as historically contingent
and emerging from relations of power (Heyes 2020, 14). The claim that
race is &ldquo;socially constructed,&rdquo; however, does not in
itself mark out a specific identity politics. Indeed, the very
contingency of race and its lack of correlation with categories that
have more meaning in everyday life (such as ethnicity or culture) may
circumscribe its political usefulness: just as feminists have found
the limits of appeals to &ldquo;women&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; so
Asian-Americans may find that among nations as diverse as Chinese,
Indian, or Vietnamese their racial designation itself provides little
common ground. That a US citizen of both Norwegian and Ashkenazi
Jewish heritage will check that they are &ldquo;white&rdquo; on a
census form says relatively little (although in a post-Trump U.S., it
arguably says more [Jardina 2019]) about their experience of their
identity, or indeed of their very different relationship to
anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>
Critical engagement with the origins and conceptualization of
subjectivity also informs poststructuralist challenges to identity
politics. Such challenges posit that it rests on a mistaken view of
the subject that assumes a <em>metaphysics of
substance</em>&mdash;that is, that a cohesive, self-identical subject
is ontologically (if not actually) prior to any form of social
injustice (Butler 2006 [1990]). This subject has certain core
essential attributes that define her or his identity, over which are
imposed forms of socialization that cause her or him to internalize
other nonessential attributes. This position, they suggest,
misrepresents both the ontology of identity and its political
significance. The alternative view offered by poststructuralists is
that the subject is itself always already a product of discourse,
which represents both the condition of possibility for a certain
subject-position and a constraint on what forms of self-making
individuals may engage in. There is no real identity&mdash;individual
or group-based&mdash;that is separable from its conditions of
possibility, and any political appeal to identity formations must
engage with the paradox of acting from the very subject-positions it
must also oppose. Central to this position is the observation that any
claim to identity must organize itself around a constitutive
exclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
An identity is established in relation to a series of differences that
have become socially recognized. These differences are essential to
its being. If they did not coexist as differences, it would not exist
in its distinctness and solidity. Entrenched in this indispensable
relation is a second set of tendencies, themselves in need of
exploration, to conceal established identities into fixed forms,
thought and lived as if their structure expressed the true order of
things. When these pressures prevail, the maintenance of one identity
(or field of identities) involves the conversion of some differences
into otherness, into evil, or one of its numerous surrogates. Identity
requires differences in order to be, and it converts difference into
otherness in order to secure its own self-certainty. (Connolly 2002,
64)
</blockquote>

<p>
The danger of identity politics, then, is that it casts as authentic
to the self or group a self-understanding that in fact is defined by
its opposition to a dominant identity, which typically represents
itself as neutral. Reclaiming such an identity as one&rsquo;s own
merely reinforces its dependence on this Other, and further
internalizes and reinforces an oppressive hierarchy. This danger is
frequently obscured by claims that particular identities are essential
or natural, as we saw with race. For example, some early gay activists
emphasized the immutable and essential natures of their sexual
identities. They were a distinctively different natural kind of
person, with the same rights as (white, middle-class) heterosexuals
(another natural kind) to find fulfillment in marriage and family
life, property ownership, personal wealth accumulation, and consumer
culture. This strand of organizing (associated more closely with
white, middle-class gay men) with its complex simultaneous appeals to
essential difference in sexual identity and to sameness in terms of
aspirations and rights claims has a history going back to
pre-Stonewall homophilic activism (see discussion in Terry 1999, esp.
353&ndash;7). While early lesbian feminists had a very different
politics, oriented around liberation from patriarchy and the creation
of separate spaces for woman-identified women, many still appealed to
a more authentic, distinctively feminist womanhood. Heterosexual
feminine identities were products of oppression, yet the literature
imagines a utopian alternative where woman-identification will
liberate the lesbian within every woman (e.g., Radicalesbians 1988
[1970]). The paradigm shift that the term &ldquo;queer&rdquo; signals,
then, is a shift to a model in which identities are more
self-consciously historicized, seen as contingent products of
particular histories rather than enduring or essential natural kinds
(Phelan 1989 and 1994; Blasius 2001). Michel Foucault&rsquo;s
<em>History of Sexuality</em> famously argues that
&ldquo;homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it
was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had been a
temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species&rdquo;
(Foucault 1978, 43). Although Foucault is the most often cited as the
originator of such &ldquo;genealogical&rdquo; arguments about
homosexuality, other often neglected writers contributed to the
emergence of this new paradigm (e.g., M. McIntosh 1968). Such theories
still co-exist uneasily with popularized essentialist accounts of
gender and sexual identity, which purport to look for a particular
gene, brain structure, or other biological feature that is
noninteractive with environment and that will explain gender-normative
behavior (including sometimes trans identity) and same-sex sexual
desire.</p>

<p>
At stake are not only epistemological and metaphysical questions about
how we can know what kind of thing &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo;
might be, but also a host of moral and political questions. Some gay
activists thus see biological explanations of sexuality as offering a
defense against homophobic commentators who believe that gay men and
lesbians can voluntarily change their desires. Indeed, much of the
intuitive hostility to genealogical or poststructuralist accounts of
sexuality within gay and lesbian communities even today seems to come
from the dual sense of many individuals that they could not have been
other than gay, and that anything less than a radically essentialist
view of sexuality will open the door to further attempts to
&ldquo;cure&rdquo; them of their homosexuality (through
&ldquo;conversion therapy,&rdquo; for example). Nonetheless, it is
perfectly possible to argue that the experience of one&rsquo;s bodily
feelings and concomitant sense of self having an origin solely inside
oneself is both deeply felt and in this sense real and that it is an
experience with a history larger than the individual (Heyes 2007;
Salamon 2010). Furthermore, as Eve Sedgwick argues, no specific form
of explanation for the origins of sexual preference will be proof
against the infinitely varied strategies of homophobia (Sedgwick 1990,
esp. 22&ndash;63). That sexual orientation takes on a metaphysical
life of its own elides the fact that it is generally sexual
behavior&mdash;not an abstract &ldquo;identity&rdquo;&mdash;that is
the object of moral disapprobation. <em>Queer</em> politics, then,
works to trouble the categories &ldquo;gay&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lesbian,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;heterosexual&rdquo; (or
indeed other categories of social thought in general), and point out
that the homo/hetero dichotomy, like many others in western
intellectual history that it arguably draws on and reinforces, is not
only mutually implicated, but also hierarchical (heterosexuality is
superior, normal, and originary, while homosexuality is inferior,
deviant, and derivative) and masquerades as natural or
descriptive.</p>

<p>
These conflicting positions within gender and sexual politics are
exemplified in the history of the expansion of gay and lesbian
organizing to those with other queer affiliations. Those describing
themselves as &ldquo;gay&rdquo; and &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; wondered if
bisexual and transgender (and then intersex, Two Spirit, asexual, and
more) people shared sufficiently similar experience and interests to
make an identity political movement. Indeed, this suspicion sometimes
worked in the opposite direction: not all trans or intersex people
have understood themselves to be queer, or to share the same political
goals as gay and lesbian organizers, for example. This rejection of
putative commonality finds an ironic parallel in challenges to the
inclusion of transwomen in women-only spaces (or indeed, their
identification as &ldquo;women&rdquo; in the first place). The
possibility of feminist solidarity across cis and trans lines hinges
on the centrality of sex and gender identities&mdash;and how those are
understood&mdash;to political spaces and organizing (Heyes 2003).
Traditions of trans, mestiza, and cyborg feminist politics have
resisted the claim of sameness and recommended models that embrace the
historicity of subject-positions and intrasubjective plurality (Stone
1991; Haraway 1991; Lugones 1994; see Bettcher 2014 for an
overview).</p>

<p>
Any instance of &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; thus has to navigate
both how &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is understood, and how
&ldquo;politics&rdquo; will function. Establishing sameness or
difference among members of social groups is only significant insofar
as it fits into a model for engaging structures of power that generate
shared experiences of oppression. In this context, the common charge
that identity politics promotes a victim mentality is often made
glibly. Nonetheless, Wendy Brown offers a more sophisticated caution
against the dangers of <em>ressentiment</em> (the moralizing revenge
of the powerless). She argues that identity politics has its own
history in liberal capitalism that relentlessly reinforces the
&ldquo;wounded attachments&rdquo; it claims to sever:
&ldquo;Politicized identity thus enunciates itself, makes claims for
itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and inscribing
its pain in politics; it can hold out no future&mdash;for itself or
others&mdash;that triumphs over this pain&rdquo; (Brown 1995, 74). The
challenge that identity politics retains attachments to hierarchized
categories defined in opposition to each other and over-identifies
with artifactual wounds has been met with more discussion of the
temporality of identity politics: can an identification be premised on
a forward-looking solidarity rather than a <em>ressentiment</em>-laden
exclusion of different Others from a political community (see Zerilli
2005; Weir 2008; Bhambra and Margee 2010)? It also invites
consideration of whether pain is always a regressive, fixed ground of
identity claims, or whether it might be a legitimate reality for
mobilization, as Tobin Siebers suggests of disability (2017,
322&ndash;3). In other words, does appealing to the damage of
oppression to the oppressed&mdash;including the pain of injustices,
emotional or psychological pain, or, sometimes, physical
pain&mdash;always mire a group in identifying through that pain, or
can &ldquo;pain and suffering &hellip; sometimes be resources for the
epistemological insights of minority identity&rdquo;? (322). </p>

<p>
Some proponents of identity politics have suggested that
poststructuralism is politically impotent, capable only of
deconstruction and never of action (Hartsock 1998, 205&ndash;226).
There are, however, political projects motivated by poststructuralist
theses. For example, Judith Butler&rsquo;s articulation of
<em>performativity</em> as a way of understanding subject-development
suggests to them and others the possibility of disarticulating
seamless performances to subvert the meanings with which they are
invested (Butler 2006 [1990]). Butler famously argues that gendered
subjects are constituted through iterative actions in which gender is
repeated and sedimented (for the individual but also as a set of
social categories), but can also always be (in theory) disrupted. Far
from being an ontologically prior quality of subjects, gender is
always in the process of being made and is thus always susceptible to
subversion. In <em>Gender Trouble</em> (Butler 2006 [1990]) uses the
example of drag to show how a performance (in the literal sense) can
disarticulate sex and gender, and reveal gender as an aesthetic and
social presentation that can be parodied, confused, or revered. That
example proved controversial, although other critics have suggested
other examples: Adrian Piper&rsquo;s conceptual art seeks to disrupt
the presumed self-identity of race by showing how it is actively
interpreted and reconstituted, never determinate and self-evident (see
e.g. MOMA 2018); or Linda Zerilli discusses the
&ldquo;world-building&rdquo; work of the Milan Women&rsquo;s Bookstore
Collective&mdash;a feminist group that rejects a subject-centred view
of women&rsquo;s injured status in favor of a protensive practice of
freedom (2005, chapter 3).</p>

<h2 id="ContPhilEngaIdenPoli">3. Contemporary Philosophical Engagement with Identity Politics</h2>

<p>
There are more and more examples of identity politics being a straw
man for various polemics. The form these most commonly take is to
represent &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; as an aggrandised,
narcissistic source of political malaise in which unrepresentative
minorities push their own self-expression through agendas of grievance
or pride, along the way attempting to suppress the free expression and
the rights of others. It&rsquo;s important to these polemics that
examples are scant and arguments unelaborated, which makes writing a
philosophical entry about identity politics increasingly challenging.
The literature in political science, analyzing the contexts in which
such polemics find purchase, has focused on the various contexts of
the growth of far-right populism (e.g. Guriev and Papaioannou 2022).
Cas Mudde and Christob&aacute;l Kaltwasser (2017) define populism as a
world-view that divides the polity into a pure people and a corrupt
elite, shrugs off the trappings of liberal democracy as a ruse of that
elite, and prefers a nationalist, authoritarian politics driven by
hostility to minorities and to pluralism in general. To the extent
that the true citizens of the nation-state are construed narrowly and
exclusively in these forms of pluralism, it paradoxically constitutes
its own kind of identity politics (Noury and Roland 2020), often
marked by white supremacism, misogyny, eugenic thinking, and
homophobia (e.g. Currell 2019, Kaul 2021, Corrales and Kiryk 2022).
Central to this view is a sometimes-tacit, sometimes-explicit
understanding of feminist and anti-racist interventions as dangerous
to the nation, the family, and tradition; Judith Butler&rsquo;s 2024
book <em>Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Gender?</em> analyzes the conceptual
role played by &ldquo;gender&rdquo; in this mode of thought across a
wide range of case studies, from the Catholic Church to Trumpism.</p>

<p>
Some commentators, especially in the US, argue more substantively that
identity politics&mdash;still under-specified, but understood as
formal demands for minority recognition based only on group
membership&mdash;is a central obstacle to functional liberalism. On
this view, identity politics is essentialist (making some version of
Kruks&rsquo; epistemology of provenance claim) and generates a siloed
politics in which constituencies defend only the importance of their
own experiences, rather than the larger political community they might
shape (Appiah 2018). Looking for people who are <em>like</em> you
rather than who share your political values as allies runs the risk of
sidelining critical political analysis of complex social locations and
elevating members of select social groups as the only persons capable
of making or understanding claims to justice. As Mark Lilla, in an
interview about his 2017 book on this point, describes his own
students (one of his identity political targets):</p>

<blockquote>
What I see, essentially, is that, to the extent that they are
political, their political interest is circumscribed by either how
they see their own identity or what they think identity issues are.
I&rsquo;m struck by the lack of interest in military affairs, class
structure, economics that&rsquo;s not economics in order to get into
business school. There&rsquo;s a lack of interest in American
religion. All of these subjects that might help you understand the
country in a richer way. They&rsquo;re very much drawn to classes that
are about themselves (Remnick 2017 [Other Internet Resources])
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider Francis Fukuyama&rsquo;s related argument that the twentieth
century was the century of the economic in politics&mdash;a contest
between a left defined through workers&rsquo; rights, social welfare,
and robust redistribution, and the right&rsquo;s drive to reduce
government by shrinking the public sector and selling publicly owned
services and replacing them with private market delivery. By contrast,
he suggests, the twenty-first century has seen the left focus
&ldquo;less on creating broad economic equality and more on promoting
the interests of a wide variety of marginalized groups, such as ethnic
minorities, immigrants and refugees, women, and LGBT people. The
right, meanwhile, has redefined its core mission as the patriotic
protection of traditional national identity, which is often explicitly
connected to race, ethnicity, or religion&rdquo; (Fukuyama 2018, 91).
This allegedly renders the left less able to address trending
inequality, and redirects its focus to &ldquo;cultural issues,&rdquo;
and validating interiority and achieving recognition&mdash;all of
which racist nationalists can easily co-opt:</p>

<blockquote>
Today, the American creedal national identity, which emerged in the
wake of the Civil War, must be revived and defended against attacks
from both the left and the right. On the right, white nationalists
would like to replace the creedal national identity with one based on
race, ethnicity, and religion. On the left, the champions of identity
politics have sought to undermine the legitimacy of the American
national story by emphasizing victimization, insinuating in some cases
that racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of systematic
exclusion are in the country&rsquo;s DNA (108)
</blockquote>

<p>
This version of identity politics is only slightly more recognizable
from the history of social movements or from the more philosophical
academic literature. Nonetheless, the popular debate rests on serious
questions about the extent to which liberal intellectual and
institutional traditions are antagonistic or consonant with the
identity political arguments embedded in feminist, queer, or critical
race politics. At the most basic philosophical level, critics of
liberalism have suggested that liberal social ontology&mdash;the model
of the nature of and relationship between subjects and
collectives&mdash;was misguided. Often citizens are conceptualized as
in principle essentially similar individuals, as for example in John
Rawls&rsquo; famous thought experiment using the &ldquo;original
position,&rdquo; in which representatives of the citizenry are
conceptually divested of all specific identities or affiliations in
order to make rational decisions about the social contract (Rawls
1971). To the extent that group interests are represented in liberal
polities, they tend to be understood as associational, forms of
interest group pluralism whereby those sharing particular interests
voluntarily join together to create a political lobby. Citizens are
free to register their individual preferences (through voting, for
example), or to aggregate themselves for the opportunity to lobby more
systematically (e.g., by forming an association such as a neighborhood
community league). These lobbies, however, are not defined by the
identity of their members so much as by specific shared interests and
goals, and when pressing their case the marginalized subjectivity of
the group members is not itself called into question. Finally,
political parties, the other primary organs of liberal democratic
government, critics suggest, have few moments of inclusivity, being
organized around party discipline, responsiveness to lobby groups, and
broad-based electoral popularity. Ultimately conventional liberal
democracy, diverse critics claim, is ontologically vulnerable in two
ways: first, the neutral citizen of liberal theory is in fact the
bearer of an identity coded white, male, bourgeois, able-bodied, and
heterosexual (Pateman 1988; Di Stefano 1991; Mills 1997; Pateman and
Mills 2007), and, second, liberal frameworks stuck on formal equality
and proceduralism cannot effectively address the ongoing structural
marginalization that persists in late capitalist liberal states, and
may even be complicit with it (Young 1990; P. Williams 1991; Brown
1995; M. Williams 1998; Mills 2017). This implicit ontology in part
explained the persistent historical failure of liberal democracies to
achieve full inclusion in power structures for members of marginalized
groups. A richer understanding of political subjects as constituted
through and by their social location, and of liberal institutions as
the product of colonial and imperial histories (Losurdo 2011), is
required. In particular, the history and experience of injustice
brought with it certain perspectives and needs that could not be
assimilated through existing institutions. Individuals are oppressed
by virtue of their membership in a particular <em>social
group</em>&mdash;that is, a collective whose members have relatively
little mobility into or out of the collective, who usually experience
their membership as involuntary, who are generally identified as
members by others, and whose opportunities are deeply shaped by the
relation of their group to corollary groups through privilege and
oppression (Cudd 2006). Liberal democratic institutions have
persistently grappled with the challenge of recognizing such
asymmetries of identity while stressing procedural and literal
equality in institutions. In this context, critics have also charged
that <em>integration</em> (or, more provocatively, assimilation) is a
guiding principle of liberalism (see Callan 2005). If the liberal
subject is coded in the way Young (1990) suggests, then attempts to
apply liberal norms of equality will risk demanding that the
marginalized conform to the identities of their oppressors. For
example, many commentators on the politics of gender and sexuality
objected to campaigns defending the right of same-sex couples to marry
or otherwise representing queer people as living up to heterosexual
(white, or middle-class) norms, on the grounds that these legal
developments assimilate same-sex relationships to an existing dominant
model, rather than challenging its historical, material, and symbolic
terms (e.g. Puar 2017). If this is <em>equality</em>, they claim, then
it looks suspiciously like the erasure of socially subordinate
identities rather than their genuine incorporation into the polity.
For some critics, all this suggests a rejection of liberalism as
inadequate to the task of rectifying the unjust social stratifications
that drive identity politics. For others, however, identity politics
is a necessary supplement to liberalism in order to enable its deepest
value commitments, and some radical liberals have argued that the
potential and underlying value orientations of liberal democracy can
still be realized through operationalizing them more robustly (for a
scholarly work that arguably defends this position, see Mills 2017,
and for its popular version see Beauchamp 2020 [Other Internet
Resources]).</p>

<p>
Identity politics, then, has a vibrant life as a target of both
far-right populist and liberal disapprobation. Ironically, it is also
something of a <em>b&ecirc;te noire</em> for leftist commentators. For
Ol&uacute;f&eacute;mi T&aacute;&iacute;w&ograve;, identity politics
(like much else) has been subject to &ldquo;elite
capture&rdquo;&mdash;a phenomenon whereby &ldquo;the advantaged few
steer resources and institutions that could serve the many toward
their own narrower interests and aims...the way socially advantaged
people tend to gain control over benefits meant for everyone&rdquo;
(2022, 22). On his analysis, we see this in Black Studies programs
captured by bourgeois scholars, or in unions with racially diverse
membership whose decision-making is dominated by white people (31).
Marxists (both orthodox and revisionist) and socialists have often
interpreted the perceived ascendancy of identity politics as
representing the end of radical materialist critique (e.g. Reed and
Michaels 2023), and capitulation to cultural criticism in place of
analysis of the material roots of oppression. In a 2018 special issue
of the Marxist journal <em>Historical Materialism</em>, for example,
the editors&rsquo; introduction describes approvingly subsequent
articles that show how</p>

<blockquote>
the Left has abrogated the notion of identity as being materially
rooted, and contingent on historical and geographical context. In its
place, we see the hegemonic acceptance of an inherently reactionary
alternative: one which perceives race, gender and sexuality as
dearly-held, self-fashioning, and self-justifying essences. Such a
concession has not only reinforced the class/identity binary, but also
led to a stifled political imagination in which identity-based
politics can only be conceptualised within a liberal-capitalist logic.
(Kumar et al. 2018, 5&ndash;6)
</blockquote>

<p>
Uncannily like those rejections by politically dissimilar critics,
identity politics, here, is both factionalizing and depoliticizing,
but on this version draws attention away from the ravages of late
capitalism toward superstructural cultural accommodations that leave
economic structures unchanged and provide a cover for worsening
structural inequalities (L&eacute;ger 2023). This argument goes back a
long way&mdash;arguably to Marx himself. In the 1990s, to give a relatively
recent example, Nancy Fraser lamented the supremacy of perspectives
that take injustice to inhere in &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; constructions
of identity that the people to whom they are attributed want to
reject. Such recognition models, she argued, require remedies that
&ldquo;valorize the group&rsquo;s &lsquo;groupness&rsquo; by
recognizing its specificity,&rdquo; thus reifying identities that
themselves are products of oppressive structures. By contrast,
injustices of distribution require redistributive remedies that aim
&ldquo;to put the group out of business as a group&rdquo; (Fraser
1997: 19). If Fraser&rsquo;s argument traces its intellectual roots to
Marx through critical theory, similar arguments come via Foucauldian
genealogy. In her 2008 book <em>Against Recognition</em>, Lois McNay
argues that identity claims that are at the heart of many contemporary
social movements are represented as demands for recognition in the
context of an over-simplified account of power. Although theorists of
recognition typically start from a Hegelian model of the subject as
dialogically formed and necessarily situated, they too quickly abandon
the radical consequences of such a view for subject formation, McNay
argues. The subject of recognition becomes both personalized and
hypostatized&mdash;divorced from the larger social systems of power
that create conditions of possibility for particular
&ldquo;identities&rdquo; (2008, esp. 1&ndash;23). In this way, the
debates around subject-formation that are at the heart of
philosophical discussions of identity politics parallel conversations
between Habermasians and Foucauldians about the possibility of a
transcendental subject that can ground practices of critique (see
Allen 2008). This varied debate has a long half-life (see Fraser 2010;
2013; McNay 2022) and contemporary manifestations. For example, Glen
Coulthard (2014) argues that the shift in colonial state-Indigenous
relations in present-day Canada from unabashed assimilationism to
demands for mutual recognition (especially of cultural
distinctiveness) cannot be an adequate decolonization strategy.
Reading the intellectual history of the politics of recognition
through Hegel to Sartre to Fanon to Benhabib, Coulthard argues that
this discourse is a reiteration (and sometimes a cover-up) of the
patriarchal, racist, and colonial relations between Indigenous people
and the Canadian state that it purports to ameliorate. Instead, he
defends a paradigm of critical Indigenous resurgence that draws on
cultural history and economic practices that are neither essentialized
nor romanticized, but that also do not rest on concession-oriented
relation-building with the existing Canadian state. Audra Simpson
makes a similar argument, suggesting that the politics of recognition
in the context of settler dispossession denies its own history,
assuming that recognition for Indigenous people can occur within the
context of such &ldquo;largely state-driven performance art&rdquo; as
reconciliation, which casts the injustices of settler colonialism as
having occurred &ldquo;in the past&rdquo; and requiring apology,
rather than acknowledging the wide-ranging material political
consequences of land theft and Indigenous sovereignty (2017,
6&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
From the early days, the presentation of a dichotomy (or a choice)
between recognition and redistribution, or the cultural and the
economic, was challenged by those who pointed out that the
intersectional politics of gender, sexuality, and race had always been
engaged and understood through the structures of capitalism (Butler
1997; <em>Upping the Anti</em> 2005; Walters 2018). Defenders point
out again how political organizing through contemporary feminism and
anti-racism&mdash;by way of movements like #MeToo or Black Lives
Matter, for example&mdash;has not shied away from the economic
components to their analyses. The binary between economic critique
that marks discussion of &ldquo;redistribution,&rdquo; and discussion
of group identity that characterizes &ldquo;recognition,&rdquo; may in
moments be conducted as if the two were separate. The idea, however,
that proponents of treating gender, sexuality, or race as intersecting
axes of individual meaning and social stratification have consistently
neglected the economic aspects of their analyses is hard to sustain.
As Suzanna Danuta Walters points out, &ldquo;the critique of identity
politics is dependent upon seeing identity as only the province of the
disenfranchised and marginal&rdquo; as well as upon seeing white men
(including the working-class, straight men who are the imagined
community of the populist right) as somehow not having
&ldquo;identity&rdquo; (Walters 2018, 477). Described by Paul Joshua
as &ldquo;anti-identity identity politics,&rdquo; this position, as
exemplified in his description of the &ldquo;All Lives Matter&rdquo;
response to Black Lives Matter, &ldquo;is predicated on the
taken-for-grantedness of a pre-established racist system which from
centuries of <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> practices is now
fixed almost silently into the socio-political infrastructure&hellip;.
Despite its universalist pretentions, it remains a cloaked
identitarian politics which through a hegemonic narrative (re)presents
itself as a radically inclusionary counter-narrative&rdquo; (2019,
16).</p>

<p>
Every time this article is revised it is more tempting to write that
&ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; is an out-moded term, over-determined
by its critics and part of a reductive political lexicon that rather
remarkably spans the socialist left, the liberal centre, and the
populist right. Yet in 2024, still, there are recent iterations of the
recognition versus redistribution debate, ongoing arguments about the
demands of intersectionality, and new forms of political resistance
within the movements that circulate under the sign &ldquo;identity
politics.&rdquo; Both flexible and extensible, identity political
tropes continue to influence new political claims: an extensive
literature approaches disability, for example, as a diverse and
dynamic set of experiences of social injustice that sediment
self-understandings among the disabled and motivate a politics that
insists dominant cultures change their exclusionary practices (Siebers
2006, 2008; Kafer 2013; Davis 2013). Perhaps most important for
philosophers, any idea of identity itself appears to be in a period of
rapid evolution. Attempts to decode human genetics and shape the
genetic make-up of future persons (Richardson and Stevens 2015), to
clone human beings, or to xeno-transplant animal organs, and so on,
all raise deep philosophical questions about the kind of thing a
person is. As more and more people form political alliances using
disembodied communications technologies, the kinds of identities that
matter seem also to shift. Identity is increasingly formed and
negotiated online. For example, Paul D&rsquo;Ambrosio and Hans-Georg
Moeller (2021) argue that social media has created a form of identity
they label &ldquo;profilicity,&rdquo; in which an individual&rsquo;s
subjectivity is neither primarily affirmed through extra-digital
social group memberships, nor through ethical or political practice
qua citizen, but rather through the construction of online profiles
that are iteratively validated by generic others in a kind of looping
effect. Finally, behaviors, beliefs, and self-understandings are
increasingly pathologized as syndromes and disorders, including
through the identification of new &ldquo;types&rdquo; of person (in
turn generating possibilities for new forms of identity politics).</p>

<p>
Increasingly, this long list of confounding variables for identity
political thought moves the debates outlined here toward
anti-identarian models that take somatic life, affect, time, or space
as organizing concepts. For example, both new materialisms and
neo-vitalist philosophies, in their political contexts, share an
emphasis on <em>becoming</em> over <em>being</em>, a
&ldquo;posthumanist&rdquo; reluctance to award ontological priority to
any shared characteristics of human beings (Wolfe 2010, 2020), a
skepticism about discourses of authenticity and belonging, and a
desire to focus on generative, forward-looking political solutions
(Bhambra and Margee 2010; Coole and Frost 2010; Connolly 2011). The
lines between humans and other animals (Haraway 2007; Donaldson and
Kymlicka 2014, 2016), between the living and the non-living (Sharp
2011), and between objects and subjects (Bennett 2009) are radically
challenged. The COVID-19 pandemic showed more clearly than ever how
the edges of human bodies are porous with our environments. To varying
degrees these emphases are echoed in other process
ontologies&mdash;whether Annemarie Mol&rsquo;s work in medical
anthropology (2002), the reintroduction of bodies as socially and
biologically dynamic and intra-active forces in forming political
subjectivities (Protevi 2009), or the ways indirect, technologically
mediated experience shapes so much of our contemporary
&ldquo;identities&rdquo; (Turkle 2023). This mass of shifts and
contradictions might be thought to mark the end of the era of identity
politics. Whatever limits are inherent to identity political
formations, however, the enduring rhetorical power of the phrase
itself indicates the deep implication of questions of power and
legitimate government with demands for self-determination that are
unlikely to fade away.</p>
