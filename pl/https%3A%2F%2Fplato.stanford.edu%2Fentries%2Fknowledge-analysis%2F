<h1>The Analysis of Knowledge</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Feb 6, 2001; substantive revision Wed Jan 21, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
For any person, there are some things they know, and some things they
don&rsquo;t. What exactly is the difference? What does it take to know
something? It&rsquo;s not enough just to believe it&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t know the things we&rsquo;re wrong about. Knowledge seems
to be more like a way of getting at the truth. The analysis of
knowledge concerns the attempt to articulate in what exactly this kind
of &ldquo;getting at the truth&rdquo; consists.</p>

<p>
More particularly, the project of analysing knowledge is to state
conditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for
propositional knowledge, thoroughly answering the question:
&ldquo;What does it take to know something?&rdquo; By
&ldquo;propositional knowledge&rdquo;, we mean knowing <em>that
something is the case</em>, i.e., knowledge of a proposition. For
example, if Susan knows that Alyssa is a musician, she has knowledge
of the proposition that Alyssa is a musician. Propositional knowledge
should be distinguished from knowledge by &ldquo;acquaintance&rdquo;,
for example when we say that Susan knows <em>Alyssa</em>, or that she
knows <em>Vancouver</em>. (Knowing Susan may involve knowing some
propositions about Susan, but it is only the latter kind of knowledge
that is our focus here.)</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Knows that&rdquo; is the canonical English expression for
indicating propositional knowledge. We also often attribute
propositional knowledge with so-called &ldquo;knows-wh&rdquo;
locutions: Sooyung might know whether the shop is open, for instance,
or Juan might know who won the election. These cases also involve
propositional knowledge: one knows these things by knowing the
proposition that is the answer to the embedded question. Sooyung can
know whether the shop is open by knowing that the shop is not open.
There is some controversy over the particular status of knowledge-how
(i.e., &ldquo;Ahmed knows how to ride a bicycle&rdquo;)&mdash;see
Stanley 2011 and his opponents discussed therein.</p>

<p>
The propositional knowledge that is the analysandum of the analysis of
knowledge literature is paradigmatically expressed in English by
sentences of the form &ldquo;<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em>&rdquo;,
where &ldquo;<em>S</em>&rdquo; refers to the knowing subject, and
&ldquo;<em>P</em>&rdquo; expresses the proposition that is known. A
proposed analysis consists of a statement of the following form:
&ldquo;<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> if and only if
<em>J</em>,&rdquo; where <em>J</em> indicates
that <em>S</em> satisfies
the analysans&mdash;paradigmatically, a list of conditions that
are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for <em>S</em> to
have knowledge that <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>
It is not enough merely to pick out the actual extension of knowledge.
Even if, in actual fact, all cases of <em>S</em> knowing that
<em>P</em> are cases in which
<em>S</em> satisfies <em>J</em>, and all cases of the latter
are cases of the former, <em>J</em> might fail as an analysis of
knowledge. For example, it might be that there are possible cases of
knowledge without <em>J</em>, or vice versa. A proper analysis of
knowledge should at least be a necessary truth. Consequently,
hypothetical thought experiments provide appropriate test cases for
various analyses, as we shall see below.</p>

<p>
Even a necessary biconditional linking knowledge to some state
<em>J</em> would probably not be sufficient for an analysis of
knowledge, although just what more is required is a matter of some
controversy. According to one version of the project, to analyze
knowledge is literally to identify the components that make up
knowledge&mdash;compare a chemist who analyzes a sample to learn its
chemical composition. On this interpretation of the project of
analyzing knowledge, the defender of a successful analysis of
knowledge will be committed to something like the metaphysical claim
that <em>what it is</em> for <em>S</em> to know that <em>P</em>
is for some list of conditions involving <em>S</em> and the
proposition that <em>P</em> to obtain. Other theorists think of
the analysis of knowledge as distinctively
<em>conceptual</em>&mdash;to analyse knowledge is to limn the
structure of the <em>concept</em> of knowledge. On one version of this
approach, the concept <em>knowledge</em> is literally composed of more
basic concepts, linked together by something like Boolean operators.
Some contributors to the literature write in terms of
<em>definitions</em> of knowledge. Consequently, an analysis is
subject not only to extensional accuracy, but to facts about the
cognitive representation of knowledge and other epistemic notions. In
practice, many epistemologists engaging in the project of analyzing
knowledge leave these metaphilosophical interpretive questions
unresolved; attempted analyses, and counterexamples thereto, are often
proposed without its being made explicit whether the claims are
intended as metaphysical or conceptual
 ones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 In many cases, this lack of specificity may be legitimate, since all
parties tend to agree that an analysis of knowledge ought <em>at
least</em> to be extensionally correct in all metaphysically possible
worlds. As we shall see, many theories have been defended and,
especially, refuted on those terms.</p>

<p>
The attempt to analyze knowledge has received a considerable amount of
attention from epistemologists, particularly in the late
20<sup>th</sup> century, but no analysis has been widely accepted.
Some contemporary epistemologists reject the assumption that knowledge
is susceptible to analysis.</p>

<h2 id="KnowJustTrueBeli">1. Knowledge as Justified True Belief</h2>

<p>
Much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century literature on the analysis of
knowledge began with a critique of a three-part
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; analysis of knowledge. Although this
analysis does derive from ideas articulated throughout the history of
epistemology, it&rsquo;s a bit of a convenient fiction to say that
this so-called &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; analysis was ever widely
accepted; it was primarily articulated in the 20<sup>th</sup> century
by its attackers. See Kaplan 1985, Dutant 2015, Antognazza 2015, and
Le Morvan 2017 on the mismatch between the canonical story and the
actual intellectual history.</p>

<p>
There are three components to the traditional analysis of knowledge.
(For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as a
&ldquo;tripartite&rdquo; analysis of knowledge.) According to this
analysis, justified true belief is necessary and sufficient for
knowledge.</p>

<div class="indent">
<strong>The Tripartite Analysis of Knowledge:</strong>
<br />
<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> if and only if:

<ol>

<li>It is true that <em>P</em>;</li>

<li><em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>; and</li>

<li><em>S</em> is justified in believing that <em>P</em>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
The tripartite analysis of knowledge is often abbreviated as the
&ldquo;JTB&rdquo; analysis, for &ldquo;justified true
belief&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s consider the three conditions in turn.</p>

<h3 id="TrutCond">1.1 The Truth Condition</h3>

<p>
Most epistemologists agree that what is false cannot be known. For
example, eighty-four is not a prime number. Consequently, it could
never be the case that anyone knows that eighty-four is a prime
number. One can only know things that are true. For this reason, the
traditional theory of knowledge includes, as one of the components for
the analysans for <em>S knows that P</em>, the condition that it
is true that <em>P</em>. (Sometimes, the explicit invocation of
truth is left out, and the relevant condition is listed simply
as <em>P</em>. See Nozick (1981: 680, n. 6).)</p>

<p>
Sometimes, when people are very confident of something that turns out
to be wrong, it can be natural to describe them as
&ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that false proposition. Suppose, for example,
that late in a sports match, the home team is so far behind that many
spectators are very confident that they will lose. If they turn around
in the final seconds to achieve a miraculous comeback and win the
game, some people might be inclined to say that, prior to the
comeback, many spectators &ldquo;knew&rdquo; that the home team would
lose. Allan Hazlett (2010) argues on the basis of data like this that
&ldquo;knows&rdquo; is not a factive
 verb.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Hazlett&rsquo;s diagnosis is deeply controversial; most
epistemologists will treat such knowledge ascriptions as a kind of
exaggeration, and not as literally true. The analysis of knowledge is
about identifying the circumstances under which someone really does
know a given proposition&mdash;not necessarily about the circumstances
under which it might be conversationally acceptable to say that they
know.</p>

<p>
Relatedly, the idea that a proposition is true does not require that
anyone can know or prove that it is true. Not all truths are
<em>established</em> truths. If you flip a coin and never check how it
landed, it may be true that it landed heads, even if nobody has any
way to tell. Truth is a <em>metaphysical</em>, as opposed to
<em>epistemological</em>, notion: truth is a matter of how things
<em>are</em>, not how they can be <em>shown</em> to be. So when we say
that only true things can be known, we&rsquo;re not (yet) saying
anything about how anyone can <em>access</em> the truth. As
we&rsquo;ll see, the other conditions have important roles to play
here. Knowledge is a kind of relationship with the truth&mdash;to know
something is to have a certain kind of access to a fact.</p>

<h3 id="BeliCond">1.2 The Belief Condition</h3>

<p>
The belief condition is only slightly more controversial than the
truth condition. The general idea behind the belief condition is that
you can only know what you believe. Failing to believe something
precludes knowing it. &ldquo;Belief&rdquo; in the context of the JTB
theory means <em>full</em> belief, or <em>outright</em> belief. In a
weak sense, one might &ldquo;believe&rdquo; something by virtue of
being pretty confident that it&rsquo;s probably true&mdash;in this
weak sense, someone who considered the home team the favourite to win
the game, even while recognizing a nontrivial possibility of their
losing, might be said to have believed that the home team would win.
Outright belief is
 stronger.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 To believe outright that <em>P</em>, it isn&rsquo;t enough to have a
pretty high confidence in <em>P</em>; it is something closer to a
commitment or a being sure, or having settled the question. In the
paper that explicitly laid out the &ldquo;justified true belief&rdquo;
analysis, Edmund Gettier (1963) actually listed three slightly
different tripartite analyses, which differed in how this condition
was articulated: one was given in terms of &ldquo;believes&rdquo;, one
in terms of &ldquo;accepts&rdquo;, and one in terms of &ldquo;is sure
that&rdquo;. Epistemologists have tended to follow Gettier in treating
these as effectively equivalent. For further discussion, see McGlynn
2014: 25&ndash;9 and Ichikawa 2017-a: &sect;7.1.</p>

<p>
Although initially it might seem obvious that knowing that <em>P</em>
requires believing that <em>P</em>, a few philosophers have argued
that knowledge without belief is indeed possible. Suppose Walter comes
home after work to find out that his house has burned down. He says:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; Critics of the belief
condition might argue that Walter knows that his house has burned down
(he sees that it has), but, as his words indicate, he does not believe
it. The standard response is that Walter&rsquo;s avowal of disbelief
is not literally true; what Walter wishes to convey by saying,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rdquo;, is not that he really does not
believe that his house has burned down, but rather that he finds it
hard to come to terms with what he sees. If he genuinely didn&rsquo;t
believe it, some of his subsequent actions, such as phoning his
insurance company, would be rather mysterious.</p>

<p>
Colin Radford (1966) gave a more substantive critique of the belief
condition. Suppose Albert is quizzed on English history. One of the
questions is: &ldquo;When did Queen Elizabeth die?&rdquo; Albert
doesn&rsquo;t think he knows, but answers the question correctly.
Moreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to which he
didn&rsquo;t think he knew the answer. Let us focus on Albert&rsquo;s
answer to the question about Elizabeth:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(E)</span><span class="sen">Elizabeth died in
1603.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Radford makes the following two claims about this example:</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">

<li>Albert does not believe (E).</li>

<li>Albert knows (E).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Radford&rsquo;s intuitions about cases like these do not seem to be
idiosyncratic; Blake Myers-Schutz &amp; Eric Schwitzgebel (2013) find
evidence suggesting that many ordinary speakers tend to react in the
way Radford suggests. In support of (a), Radford emphasizes that
Albert thinks he doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to the question. He
doesn&rsquo;t trust his answer because he takes it to be a mere guess.
In support of (b), Radford argues that Albert&rsquo;s answer is not at
all just a lucky guess. The fact that he answers most of the questions
correctly indicates that he has actually learned, and never forgotten,
such historical facts.</p>

<p>
Since he takes (a) and (b) to be true, Radford holds that belief is
not necessary for knowledge. But both of these intuitions are
controversial. Some epistemologists might deny (a), arguing that
Albert does have a <em>tacit</em> belief that (E), even though
it&rsquo;s not one that he thinks amounts to knowledge. See e.g.,
David Rose &amp; Jonathan Schaffer (2013). Alternatively, one might
deny (b), arguing that Albert&rsquo;s correct answer is not an
expression of knowledge, perhaps because it is insufficiently
confident. See Nagel 2010 and Ichikawa 2024 on ways in which
uncertainty can undermine knowledge by undermining belief.</p>

<p>
Maria Antognazza (2020) offers quite a different kind of challenge to
the belief condition on knowledge: she rejects the orthodox
philosophical understanding of belief, according to which it is a kind
of doxastic commitment that does not depend on whether or not it
amounts to an apprehension of reality, holding instead that belief, by
its nature, is a cognitive representation supported only indirectly by
experience. Belief, according to Antognazza, is fundamentally unlike
knowledge, in that by definition, one can only believe that which is
not directly apprehended. This isn&rsquo;t merely a denial that belief
is a necessary condition for knowledge; on her view, believing
<em>P</em> is actually <em>incompatible</em> with knowing <em>P</em>.
This is not a mainstream or widely held approach to belief in
contemporary epistemology, but Antognazza argues that it is supported
by considerations in the philosophy of mind, and representative of
important historical epistemological traditions.</p>

<h3 id="JustCond">1.3 The &ldquo;Justification&rdquo; Condition</h3>

<p>
Why is a third condition necessary? Why not say that knowledge is true
belief? The standard answer rationale has to do wtih cases where a
belief might be true even though it is formed improperly. Suppose that
William flips a coin and confidently believes&mdash;on no
particular basis&mdash;that it will land tails. If, coincidentally,
the coin does indeed land tails, then William&rsquo;s belief was true;
but such a lucky guess, intuitively, can&rsquo;t count as knowledge.
For William to know, his belief must be grounded in adequate
evidential support. Contemporary epistemologists often use
&ldquo;justification&rdquo; as the name for the kind of support that
is needed here. Recognition of the need for something like this
condition is often traced to Plato&rsquo;s <em>Theaetetus</em>, where
Socrates points out that &ldquo;true opinion&rdquo; is in general
insufficient for knowledge. For example, if a lawyer employs sophistry
to induce a jury into a belief that happens to be true, this belief is
insufficiently well-grounded to constitute knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="JustLabe">1.3.1 The &ldquo;Justification&rdquo; Label</h4>

<p>
Although &ldquo;justification&rdquo; is the standard contemporary name
for the condition in question, this label is a relatively recent
(20<sup>th</sup> century) development, and the name can carry some
potentially misleading connotations, especially for those not already
versed in the literature.</p>

<p>
In an ordinary sense, something might count as &ldquo;justified&rdquo;
only after someone has successfully undertaken the project of
<em>justifying</em> it. Understood in this way, the idea that a true
belief must be justified in order to count as knowledge would mean
that in order for <em>S</em> to know that <em>P</em>, <em>S</em> must
have already given a positive defense of their belief that <em>P</em>,
one <em>demonstrating</em> that their belief is appropriate.
Epistemologists who endorse a justification condition on knowledge do
not typically mean their condition to be understood in such a strong
way. Rather, they typically intend to suggest only that a
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that <em>P</em> is knowledge only if their
belief is <em>in fact</em> appropriately supported by
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s evidence. This might be so, even if <em>S</em> has
not engaged in a project of <em>actively justifying</em> their belief.
Consider, for example, an ordinary person&rsquo;s belief that five
plus five equals ten. Most people have never attempted to justify this
belief, and probably would be at a loss as to how to go about
justifying it. But for most people, that belief would qualify as an
instance of
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 For this reason, it is important, in understanding the role of the
justification condition in the analysis of knowledge, not to assume
that justification is a dialectical activity in which the believer
must have engaged. Some epistemologists prefer to use different labels
for this condition for this reason, such as the idea that a belief is
<em>rational</em> or <em>warranted</em> or <em>evidentially
 well-supported</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Jonathan Ichikawa (2024: ch. 3) gives an additional critique of the
&ldquo;justification&rdquo; label for this condition, arguing that
this word carries a negative presupposition to the effect that belief
should, by default, be considered suspect. Ichikawa argues that, for
this reason, the idea that beliefs need to be &ldquo;justified&rdquo;
furthers unwarranted skeptical biases.</p>

<h4 id="InteExte">1.3.2 Internalism and Externalism</h4>

<p>
There is considerable disagreement among epistemologists concerning
what the relevant sort of justification here is. <em>Internalists</em>
about justification think that whether a belief is justified depends
wholly on states, that are, in some sense, <em>internal</em> to the
subject. According to one common such sense of &ldquo;internal&rdquo;,
only those features of a subject&rsquo;s experience which are directly
or introspectively available count as
&ldquo;internal&rdquo;&mdash;call this &ldquo;access
internalism&rdquo;. According to another, only intrinsic states of the
subject are &ldquo;internal&rdquo;&mdash;call this &ldquo;state
internalism&rdquo;. See the <em>Internalist vs. Externalist
Conceptions of Epistemic Justification</em> entry (Pappas 2023) for
more detail.</p>

<p>
Earl Conee and Richard Feldman (2001) present an example of an
internalist view. They have it that <em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that
<em>P</em> is justified if and only if believing that <em>P</em> is
the attitude towards <em>P</em> that best fits <em>S</em>&rsquo;s
evidence, where the latter is understood to depend only on
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s internal mental states. Conee and Feldman call
their view &ldquo;evidentialism&rdquo;, and characterize this as the
thesis that justification is wholly a matter of the subject&rsquo;s
evidence. Given their (not unsubstantial) assumption that what
evidence a subject has is an internal matter, evidentialism implies
 internalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 <em>Externalists</em> about justification think that factors external
to the subject can be relevant for justification. For example, process
reliabilists think that justified beliefs are those which are formed
by a cognitive process which tends to produce a high proportion of
true beliefs relative to false
 ones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 We shall return to the question of how reliabilist approaches bear on
the analysis of knowledge in
 <a href="#ReliTheoKnow">&sect;6.1</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="KindJust">1.3.3 Kinds of Justification</h4>

<p>
It is worth noting that one might distinguish between two importantly
different notions of justification, standardly referred to as
&ldquo;propositional justification&rdquo; and &ldquo;doxastic
justification&rdquo; (sometimes &ldquo;<em>ex ante</em>&rdquo;
justification and &ldquo;<em>ex post</em>&rdquo; justification,
 respectively).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Unlike that between internalist and externalist approaches to
justification, the distinction between propositional and doxastic
justification does not represent a conflict to be resolved; it is a
distinction between two distinct properties that are sometimes called
&ldquo;justification&rdquo;. Propositional justification concerns
whether a subject has sufficient reason to believe a given
 proposition;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 doxastic justification concerns whether a given belief is held
appropriately. One common way of relating the two is to suggest that
propositional justification is the more fundamental, and that doxastic
justification is a matter of a subject having a belief that is
appropriately responsive to or based on their propositional
justification.</p>

<p>
The precise relation between propositional and doxastic justification
is subject to controversy, but it is uncontroversial that the two
notions can come apart. Suppose that Ingrid ignores a great deal of
excellent evidence indicating that a given neighborhood is dangerous,
but superstitiously comes to believe that the neighborhood is
dangerous when she sees a black cat crossing the street. Since forming
beliefs on the basis of superstition is not an epistemically
appropriate way of forming beliefs, Ingrid&rsquo;s belief is not
doxastically justified; nevertheless, she <em>does</em> have good
reason to believe as she does, so she does have propositional
justification for the proposition that the neighborhood is
dangerous.</p>

<p>
Since knowledge is a particularly successful kind of belief, doxastic
justification is a stronger candidate for being closely related to
knowledge; the JTB theory is typically thought to invoke doxastic
justification (but cf. Lowy 1978).</p>

<h2 id="LighKnow">2. Lightweight Knowledge</h2>

<p>
Some epistemologists have suggested that there may be multiple senses
of the term &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, and that not all of them require
all three elements of the tripartite theory of knowledge. Some have
argued that there is, in addition to the sense of
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; gestured at above, another, <em>weak</em>
sense of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; that requires only true belief (see
e.g., Hawthorne 2002 and Goldman &amp; Olsson 2009; the latter
contains additional relevant references). This view is sometimes
motivated by the thought that, when we consider whether someone knows
that <em>P</em>, or wonder who of a group of people know that
<em>P</em>, often, we are not at all interested in whether the
relevant subjects have beliefs that are justified; we just want to
know whether they have the true belief. For example, as John Hawthorne
(2002: 253&ndash;54) points out, one might ask how many students know
that Vienna is the capital of Austria; the correct answer, one might
think, just is the number of students who offer &ldquo;Vienna&rdquo;
as the answer to the corresponding question, irrespective of whether
their beliefs are justified. Similarly, if you are planning a surprise
party for Eugene and ask whether he knows about it, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
may be an appropriate answer merely on the grounds that Eugene
believes that you are planning a party.</p>

<p>
One could allow that there is a lightweight sense of knowledge that
requires only true belief; another option is to decline to accept the
intuitive sentences as true at face value. A theorist might, for
instance, deny that sentences like &ldquo;Eugene knows that you are
planning a party&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eighteen students know that Vienna
is the capital of Austria&rdquo; are literally true in the envisaged
situations, explaining away their apparent felicity as loose talk or
hyperbole.</p>

<p>
Even among those epistemologists who think that there is a lightweight
sense of &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that does not require justification, most
typically admit that there is also a stronger sense which does, and
that it is this stronger state that is the main target of
epistemological theorizing about knowledge. The remainder of this
article will set aside the lightweight sense, if indeed there is one,
and focus on the stronger sense of &ldquo;knows&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="CounTripAnal">3. Counterexamples to the Tripartite Analysis</h2>

<p>
It is nearly universally accepted amongst contemporary epistemologists
that there are counterexamples to the analysis of knowledge as
justified true belief. Although most agree that each element of the
tripartite theory is <em>necessary</em> for knowledge, it is widely
accepted that they are not themselves <em>sufficient</em>. In other
words, there seem to be cases of justified true belief that still fall
short of knowledge. Such examples have actually been discussed since
antiquity. Here, for example, is an example from the Indian
philosopher Dharmottara, c. 770 CE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Imagine that we are seeking water on a hot day. We suddenly see water,
or so we think. In fact, we are not seeing water but a mirage, but
when we reach the spot, we are lucky and find water right there under
a rock. Can we say that we had genuine knowledge of water? The answer
seems to be negative, for we were just lucky. (qtd. in Dreyfus 1997:
292)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a gave similar cases in the 12<sup>th</sup>
century CE&mdash;see Das 2021a: &sect;2.1. It&rsquo;s typically
thought to be intuitive that in Dharmottara&rsquo;s case, one does not
know that there is water at the location in question. But it also
seems that all three conditions of the tripartite theory of knowledge
are met: it is <em>true</em> that there is water in that spot, one
<em>believes</em> that there is water in that spot, and one&rsquo;s
belief is <em>justified</em> or reasonable, since it is based on
one&rsquo;s sensory experience. So, it seems, cases like this show
that the tripartite analysis of knowledge has counterexamples.</p>

<p>
The 14<sup>th</sup>-century Italian philosopher Peter of Mantua
presented this similar case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let it be assumed that Plato is next to you and you know him to be
running, but you mistakenly believe that he is Socrates, so that you
firmly believe that Socrates is running. However, let it be so that
Socrates is in fact running in Rome; however, you do not know this.
(from Peter of Mantua&rsquo;s <em>De scire et dubitare</em>, given in
Boh 1985: 95)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bertrand Russell gave a similar case in the early 20<sup>th
</sup>century:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If you look at a clock which you believe to be going, but which in
fact has stopped, and you happen to look at it at a moment when it is
right, you will acquire a true belief as to the time of day, but you
cannot be correctly said to have knowledge. (Russell
 1923:113) <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup> </p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Although such cases have been discussed throughout the history of
Eastern and Western epistemology, they came into far more theoretical
salience in the second half of the 20th century, prompted especially
by Gettier&rsquo;s influential 1963 paper, &ldquo;Is Justified True
Belief Knowledge?&rdquo;. Gettier presented two cases in which a true
belief is inferred from a justified false belief, including this
one:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let us suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following
proposition: (f) Jones owns a Ford. &hellip; Smith has another friend,
Brown, of whose whereabouts he is totally ignorant. Smith selects
three place-names quite at random, and constructs the following three
propositions:</p>

<p>
(g) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston;
<br />
(h) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona;
<br />
(i) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Brest-Litovsk.</p>

<p>
Each of these propositions is entailed by (f). &hellip; Smith is
therefore completely justified in believing each of these three
propositions. Smith, of course, has no idea where Brown is. But
imagine now that two further conditions hold. First, Jones does
<em>not</em> own a Ford, but is at present driving a rented car. And
secondly, by the sheerest coincidence, and entirely unknown to Smith,
the place mentioned in proposition (h) happens really to be the place
where Brown is. (Gettier 1963: 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Gettier observed that, intuitively, Smith does not know the
disjunction (h), despite having a justified true belief to that
effect. Gettier&rsquo;s paper was enormously influential. Despite
their older history, counterexamples to the tripartite theory have
since often come to be known as &ldquo;Gettier cases&rdquo;. Since
they appear to refute the JTB analysis, many epistemologists,
especially in the late 20th century, undertook the project of
attempting to amend that analysis to provide an adequate account. The
difficulty in doing so with success is what is commonly referred to as
the &ldquo;Gettier problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
As indicated in
 <a href="#">&sect;1.3</a>,
 one role of the justification condition was to rule out lucky guesses
as cases of knowledge. A lesson of the Gettier problem is that it
appears that even true beliefs that are justified can nevertheless be
epistemically lucky in a way inconsistent with knowledge. Much of the
focus in the analysis of knowledge literature was on identifying an
additional condition, beyond justification, truth, and belief, that
might explain why so-called &ldquo;Gettier cases&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t
knowledge. The hope was that articulating such a fourth condition
<em>X</em> would allow for a &ldquo;JTB + <em>X</em>&rdquo; analysis
of knowledge that did not succumb to counterexamples.</p>

<p>
Let us consider an instance of this attempt to articulate a
&ldquo;degettiering&rdquo; condition.</p>

<h2 id="NoFalsLemm">4. No False Lemmas</h2>

<p>
One natural idea was to add the following fourth condition to the
traditional analysis:</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">

<li><em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that <em>P</em> is not inferred from any
 falsehood.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></li>
 </ol>

<p>
The subjects of Gettier&rsquo;s cases straightforwardly violated this
condition. When Smith believes that <em>P</em> (where
&ldquo;<em>P</em>&rdquo; designates the
disjunction <em>either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in
Barcelona</em>), he does so because he inferred it from the justified
but false proposition <em>that Jones owns a Ford</em>. The
other counterexamples above might also be thought to involve inference
from falsehoods. In Russell&rsquo;s case, for example, one ends up
with the true belief that it is, say, 1:00, but this is based in part
on the false belief that one is looking at a clock that is functioning
properly. So a condition like this one might explain why these cases
aren&rsquo;t knowledge, pointing to the &ldquo;missing
ingredient&rdquo; left out by the tripartite theory.</p>

<p>
However, this &ldquo;no false lemmas&rdquo; proposal is not widely
accepted. There are apparent examples of Gettier cases that need
involve no inference; therefore, there are possible cases of justified
true belief without knowledge, even though this proposed fourth
condition is met. Suppose, for example, that James, who is relaxing on
a bench in a park, observes an apparent dog in a nearby field. So he
believes:</p>

<ol start="4" type="a">

<li>There is a dog in the field.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Suppose further that the putative dog is actually a robot dog so
perfect that it could not be distinguished from an actual dog by
vision alone. James does not know that such robot dogs exist; a
Japanese toy manufacturer has only recently developed them, and what
James sees is a prototype that is used for testing the public&rsquo;s
response. Given these assumptions, (d) is of course false. But suppose
further that just a few feet away from the robot dog, there is a real
dog, concealed from James&rsquo;s view. Given this further assumption,
James&rsquo;s belief in (d) is true. And since this belief is based on
ordinary perceptual processes, most epistemologists will agree that it
is justified. But as in the counterexamples to the tripartite theory,
James&rsquo;s belief appears to be true only as a matter of luck, in a
way inconsistent with knowledge. So once again, what we have before us
is a justified true belief that isn&rsquo;t
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, arguably, this belief is directly justified by a visual
experience; it is not inferred from any falsehood. If so, then the JTB
account, even if supplemented with (4), gives us the wrong result that
James knows (d).</p>

<p>
Another case illustrating that clause (4) won&rsquo;t do the job is
the well-known Barn County case, first given by Carl Ginet, and
published by Alvin Goldman (1976). Suppose there is a county with the
following peculiar feature. The landscape next to the road leading
through that county is peppered with barn facades: structures that
from the road look exactly like barns. Observation from any other
viewpoint would immediately reveal these structures to be fakes:
devices erected for the purpose of fooling unsuspecting motorists into
believing in the presence of barns. Suppose Henry is driving along the
road that leads through Barn County. Naturally, he will on numerous
occasions form false beliefs in the presence of barns. Since Henry has
no reason to suspect that he is the victim of organized deception,
these beliefs are justified. Now suppose further that, on one of those
occasions when he believes there is a barn over there, he happens to
be looking at the one and only real barn in the county. This time, his
belief is justified and true. But since its truth is the result of
luck, it is exceedingly plausible to judge that Henry&rsquo;s belief
is not an instance of knowledge. Yet condition (4) is met in this
case. His belief does not appear to be the result of any inference
from a falsehood. Once again, we see that (4) does not succeed as a
general solution to the Gettier problem.</p>

<h2 id="ModaCond">5. Modal Conditions</h2>

<h3 id="Sens">5.1 Sensitivity</h3>

<p>
Another candidate fourth condition on knowledge is
<em>sensitivity</em>. Sensitivity, to a first approximation, is this
counterfactual relation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that <em>P</em> is sensitive if and only if,
if were false that <em>P</em>, <em>S</em> would not believe that
 <em>P</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
A sensitivity condition on knowledge was defended by Robert Nozick
(1981). Given one influential semantics for counterfactual
conditionals (Lewis 1973), the sensitivity condition is equivalent to
the requirement that, in the nearest possible worlds in which
not-<em>P</em>, the subject does not believe that <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>
One motivation for including a sensitivity condition in an analysis of
knowledge is that there seems to be an intuitive sense in which
knowledge requires not merely being correct, but <em>tracking</em> the
truth in other possible circumstances. This approach seems to be a
plausible diagnosis of what goes wrong in at least some of the
counterexamples to the traditional theory. For example, in
Dharmottara&rsquo;s desert water case, your belief that there is water
in a certain location appears to be insensitive to the fact of the
water. For if there were no water there, you would have held the same
belief on the same grounds&mdash;<em>viz</em>., the mirage.</p>

<p>
However, it is doubtful that a sensitivity condition can account for
all the counterexamples. It does so only in cases in which, had the
proposition in question been false, it would have been believed
anyway. As Saul Kripke (2011: 167&ndash;68) has pointed out, there are
counterexamples to the traditional analysis that are not like this.
Consider for instance the Barn County case mentioned above. Henry
looks at a particular location where there happens to be a barn and
believes there to be a barn there. The sensitivity condition rules out
this belief as knowledge only if, if there hadn&rsquo;t been a barn
there, Henry would still have believed there was. But this
counterfactual may be false, depending on the details of the case. For
instance, it is false if the particular location Henry is examining is
not one that would have been suitable for the erecting of a barn
facade. Relatedly, as Kripke has also indicated (2011: 186), if we
suppose that barn facades are always green, but genuine barns are
always red, Henry&rsquo;s belief that he sees a <em>red</em> barn will
be sensitive, even though his belief that he sees a <em>barn</em> will
not. (We assume Henry is unaware that colour signifies anything
relevant.) Since intuitively, the former belief looks to fall short of
knowledge in just the same way as the latter, a sensitivity condition
will only handle some of the intuitive counterexamples to the
traditional analysis.</p>

<p>
Most epistemologists today reject sensitivity requirements on
knowledge. The chief motivation against a sensitivity condition was
articulated by Keith DeRose (1995: 27&ndash;28): given plausible
assumptions, a sensitivity condition on knowledge has unacceptable
implications. Assume that ordinary subjects know at least many of the
things we typically take them to know. For example, George, who can
see and use his hands perfectly well, knows that he has hands. This by
itself is perfectly consistent with a sensitivity condition on
knowledge, since if George did <em>not</em> have hands&mdash;if
they&rsquo;d been recently chopped off, for instance&mdash;he would
not believe that he had hands.</p>

<p>
But now imagine a skeptical scenario in which George does not have
hands. Suppose that George is the victim of a Cartesian demon,
deceiving him into believing that he has hands. If George were in such
a scenario, he would falsely believe himself not to be in such a
scenario. So given the sensitivity condition, George cannot know that
he is not in such a scenario.</p>

<p>
Although these two verdicts&mdash;the knowledge-attributing one about
ordinary knowledge, and the knowledge-denying one about the skeptical
scenario&mdash;are arguably each intuitive, it is intuitively
problematic to hold them together. Their conjunction is, in
DeRose&rsquo;s term, <em>abominable</em>. A sentence like
&ldquo;George knows that he has hands, but he doesn&rsquo;t know that
he&rsquo;s not the handless victim of a Cartesian demon&rdquo; is
often called an &ldquo;abominable conjunction&rdquo;; a sensitivity
condition on knowledge, combined with the nonskeptical claim that
there is ordinary knowledge, seems to imply such abominable
 conjunctions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Most contemporary epistemologists have taken considerations like these
to be sufficient reason to reject sensitivity
 conditions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 But some epistemologists have continued to defend sensitivity
 conditions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 See Becker &amp; Black 2012 for some contemporary discussions.</p>

<h3 id="Safe">5.2 Safety</h3>

<p>
Although few epistemologists today endorse a sensitivity condition on
knowledge, the idea that knowledge requires a subject to stand in a
particular modal relation to the proposition known remains a popular
one. In his 1999 paper &ldquo;How to Defeat Opposition to
Moore&rdquo;, Ernest Sosa proposed that a <em>safety</em> condition
ought to take the role that sensitivity was intended to play. Sosa
characterized safety as the counterfactual contrapositive of
sensitivity.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Sensitivity:</strong>
<br />
If it were false that <em>P</em>, <em>S</em> would not believe
that <em>P</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Safety:</strong>
<br />
If <em>S</em> were to believe that <em>P</em>, it would not be false
 that <em>P</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Although contraposition is valid for the material conditional, Sosa
suggests that it is invalid for counterfactuals, which is why
sensitivity and safety are not equivalent. An example of a safe belief
that is not sensitive, according to Sosa, is the belief that a distant
skeptical scenario does not obtain. If we stipulate that George,
discussed above, has never been at risk of being the victim of a
Cartesian demon&mdash;because, say, Cartesian demons do not exist in
George&rsquo;s world&mdash;then George&rsquo;s belief that he is not
such a victim is a safe one, even though we saw in the previous
section that it could not be sensitive. Notice that although we
stipulated that George is not at risk of deceit by Cartesian demons,
we did <em>not</em> stipulate that George himself had any particular
access to this fact. Unless he does, safety, like sensitivity, will be
an <em>externalist</em> condition on knowledge in the
&ldquo;access&rdquo; sense. It is also externalist in the
&ldquo;state&rdquo; sense, since the truth of the relevant
counterfactuals will depend on features outside the subject.</p>

<p>
Characterizing safety in these counterfactual terms depends on
substantive assumptions about the semantics of counterfactual
 conditionals.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 If we were to accept, for instance, David Lewis&rsquo;s or Robert
Stalnaker&rsquo;s treatment of counterfactuals, according to which the
truth value of a counterfactual conditional with a true antecedent is
just the truth value of its consequent, all true beliefs would count
as safe according to the counterfactual analysis of
 safety.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Sosa intends the relevant counterfactuals to be making a stronger
claim, requiring roughly that in <em>all nearby</em> worlds in which
<em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>, it is not false
that <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>
Rather than resting on a contentious treatment of counterfactuals,
then, it may be most perspicuous to understand the safety condition
more directly in these modal terms, as Sosa himself often does:</p>

<div class="indent" style="margin-bottom:10px">

<p class="bold" style="margin:0">
Safety:</p>

<p style="margin: 0">
In all nearby worlds where <em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>, it is
not false that <em>P</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Evaluating analyses of knowledge that incorporate safety conditions
can be difficult, given the vagueness of the stated
&ldquo;nearby&rdquo; condition. The status of potential
counterexamples will not always be straightforward to apply. For
example, Juan Comesa&ntilde;a (2005) presents a case he takes to
refute the requirement that knowledge be safe. In
Comesa&ntilde;a&rsquo;s example, the host of a Halloween party enlists
Judy to direct guests to the party. Judy&rsquo;s instructions are to
give everyone the same directions, which are in fact accurate, but
that if she sees Michael, the party will be moved to another location.
(The host does not want Michael to find the party.) Suppose Michael
never shows up. If a given guest does not, but very nearly does,
decide to wear a very realistic Michael costume to the party, then his
belief, based in Judy&rsquo;s testimony, about the whereabouts of the
party will be true, but could, Comesa&ntilde;a says, easily have been
false. (Had he merely made a slightly different choice about his
costume, he would have been deceived.) Comesa&ntilde;a describes the
case as a counterexample to a safety condition on knowledge. Likewise,
some epistemologists (e.g. Neta and Rohrbaugh 2004:399) argue
that safety conditions fare poorly with respect to some versions of
Ginet&rsquo;s barn facade cases. However, it is open to a safety
theorist to argue that the relevant skeptical scenarios, though
possible and <em>in some sense</em> nearby, is not near enough in the
relevant respect to falsify the safety condition. Such a theorist
would, if she wanted the safety condition to deliver clear verdicts,
face the task of articulating just what the relevant notion of
similarity amounts to (see also Bogardus 2014).</p>

<p>
Not all further clarifications of a safety condition will be suitable
for the use of the latter in an analysis of knowledge. In particular,
if the respect of similarity that is relevant for safety is itself
explicated in terms of knowledge, then an analysis of knowledge which
made reference to safety would be in this respect circular. This, for
instance, is how Timothy Williamson characterizes safety. He writes,
in response to a challenge by Goldman:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In many cases, someone with no idea of what knowledge is would be
unable to determine whether safety obtained. Although they could use
the principle that safety entails truth to exclude some cases, those
are not the interesting ones. Thus Goldman will be disappointed when
he asks what the safety account predicts about various examples in
which conflicting considerations pull in different directions. One may
have to decide whether safety obtains by first deciding whether
knowledge obtains, rather than vice versa. (Williamson 2009: 305)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because safety is understood only in terms of knowledge, safety so
understood cannot serve in an analysis of knowledge. (Nor is it
Williamson&rsquo;s intent that it should do so; as we will see below,
Williamson rejects the project of analyzing knowledge.)</p>

<h3 id="ReleAlte">5.3 Relevant Alternatives</h3>

<p>
A third approach to modal conditions on knowledge worthy of mention is
the requirement that for a subject to know that <em>P</em>, they must
rule out all &ldquo;relevant alternatives&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
they must be able to rule out any relevant possibility in
which <em>P</em> is false. Significant early proponents of this
view include Stine 1976, Goldman 1976, and Dretske 1981; more recent
defenders include Lewis 1996, Schaffer 2004, Ichikawa 2017-a,
Blome-Tillmann 2009-b, and Gardiner 2020.</p>

<p>
The idea behind this approach to knowledge is that for a subject to
know that <em>P</em>, they must be able to &ldquo;rule out&rdquo;
competing hypotheses to the possibility that <em>P</em>&mdash;but that
only some subset of all possibilities in which <em>P</em> is
false are &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; for knowledge attributions. Consider
for example, the differences between the several models that have been
produced of Apple&rsquo;s iPhone. To be able to know by sight that a
particular phone is the 16 Plus model, it is natural to suppose that
one must be able to tell the difference between the iPhone 16 Plus and
the iPhone 15 Pro; the possibility that the phone in question is a
different model is a relevant alternative. But perhaps there are other
possibilities in which the belief that there is an iPhone 16 Plus is
false that do not need to be ruled out&mdash;perhaps, for instance,
the possibility that the phone is not an iPhone but a replica made as
a movie prop needn&rsquo;t be considered. Likewise for the possibility
that there is no object there at all, the phone-like appearances being
the product of a Cartesian demon&rsquo;s machinations. Notice that in
these cases and many of the others that motivate the
relevant-alternatives approach to knowledge, there is an intuitive
sense in which the relevant alternatives tend to be more
<em>similar</em> to actuality than irrelevant ones. For this reason,
the relevant alternatives theory and safety-theoretic approaches are
similar, both in verdict and in spirit. As in the case of a safety
theorist, the relevant alternatives theorist faces a challenge in
attempting to articulate what determines which possibilities are
relevant in a given situation.</p>

<h2 id="DoinWithJust">6. Doing without Justification?</h2>

<p>
As we saw in
 <a href="#">&sect;1.3</a>,
 one motivation for including a justification condition in an analysis
of knowledge was to prevent lucky guesses from counting as knowledge.
However, the Gettier problem shows that including a justification
condition does not rule out all epistemically problematic instances of
luck. Consequently, some epistemologists have suggested that positing
a justification condition on knowledge was a false move; perhaps it is
some other condition that ought to be included along with truth and
belief as components of knowledge. This kind of strategy was advanced
by a number of authors from the late 1960s to the early 1980s,
although there has been less discussion of it
 since.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Kornblith 2008 and Ichikawa 2024: ch. 3 provide notable
exceptions.</p>

<p>
This section will consider attempts to amend the tripartite analysis,
not by adding a fourth condition, but by replacing the justification
condition with a different one.</p>

<h3 id="ReliTheoKnow">6.1 Reliabilist Theories of Knowledge</h3>

<p>
One candidate property for such a state is <em>reliability</em>. Part
of what is problematic about lucky guesses is precisely that they are
so lucky: such guesses are formed in a way such that it is unlikely
that they should turn out true. According to a certain form of
knowledge reliabilism, it is unreliability, not lack of justification,
which prevents such beliefs from amounting to knowledge. Reliabilist
theories of knowledge incorporate this idea into a reliability
condition on
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 Here is an example of such a view:</p>

<div class="indent" style="margin-bottom:10px">

<p class="bold" style="margin:0">
Simple K-Reliabilism:</p>

<p style="margin: 0">
<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> iff</p>

<ol>

<li>It is true that <em>P</em>;</li>

<li><em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>; and</li>

<li><em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that <em>P</em> was produced by a
reliable cognitive process.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Simple K-Reliabilism replaces the justification clause in the
traditional tripartite theory with a reliability clause. As we have
seen, reliabilists about justification think that justification for a
belief consists in a genesis in a reliable cognitive process. Given
this view, Simple K-Reliabilism and the JTB theory are equivalent.
However, the present proposal is silent on justification. Goldman 1979
is the seminal defense of reliabilism about justification; reliabilism
is extended to knowledge in Goldman 1986. See Goldman &amp; Beddor
2021 for a survey of reliabilism in general. Dretske (1985: 177)
suggests that invoking reliability instead of justification in an
approach to knowledge better allows for knowledge in non-human
animals. (See also Dretske 1989: 95)</p>

<h3 id="CausTheoKnow">6.2 Causal Theories of Knowledge</h3>

<p>
Another move in a similar spirit to K-reliabilism replaces the
justification clause in the JTB theory with a condition requiring a
causal connection between the belief and the fact
 believed;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 this is the approach of Goldman (1967,
 1976).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 Goldman&rsquo;s own causal theory is a sophisticated one; we will not
engage with its details here. See Goldman&rsquo;s papers. Instead,
consider a simplified causal theory of knowledge, which illustrates
the main motivation behind causal theories.</p>

<div class="indent" style="margin-bottom:10px">

<p class="bold" style="margin:0">
Simple Causal Theory of Knowledge:</p>

<p style="margin: 0">
<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> iff</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">

<li>It is true that <em>P</em>;</li>

<li><em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>; and</li>

<li><em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief that <em>P</em> is caused by the fact
that <em>P</em>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Do approaches like Simple K-Reliabilism or the Simple Causal Theory
fare better than the tripartite theory with respect to Gettier cases?
Although some proponents have suggested they do&mdash;see e.g.,
Dretske 1985: 179; Plantinga 1993: 48&mdash;many of the standard
counterexamples to the JTB theory appear to refute these views as
well. Consider again the case of the barn facades. Henry sees a real
barn, and that&rsquo;s why he believes there is a barn nearby. This
belief is formed by perceptual processes, which are by-and-large
reliable: only rarely do they lead him into false beliefs. So it looks
like the case meets the conditions of Simple K-Reliabilism just as
much as it does those of the JTB theory. It is also a counterexample
to the causal theory, since the real barn Henry perceives is causally
responsible for his belief. There is reason to doubt, therefore, that
shifting from justification to a condition like reliability will
escape the Gettier
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 Gettier cases seem to pose as much of a problem for K-reliabilism and
causal theories as for the JTB account. Neither theory alone seems to
succeed in stating sufficient conditions for
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="KnowAnal">7. Is Knowledge Analyzable?</h2>

<p>
Gettier&rsquo;s paper launched a flurry of philosophical activity by
epistemologists attempting to revise the JTB theory, usually by adding
one or more conditions, to close the gap between knowledge and
justified true belief. We have seen already how several of these
attempts failed. When intuitive counterexamples were proposed to each
theory, epistemologists often responded by amending their theories,
complicating the existing conditions or adding new ones. Much of this
dialectic is chronicled thoroughly by Shope 1983, to which the
interested reader is directed.</p>

<p>
After some decades of such iterations, some epistemologists began to
doubt that progress was being made. In her 1994 paper &ldquo;The
Inescapability of Gettier Problems&rdquo;, Linda Zagzebski suggested
that no analysis sufficiently similar to the JTB analysis could ever
avoid the problems highlighted by Gettier&rsquo;s cases. More
precisely, Zagzebski argued, any analysans of the form JTB+<em>X</em>,
where <em>X</em> is a condition or list of conditions logically
independent from justification, truth, and belief, would be
susceptible to Gettier-style counterexamples. She offered what was in
effect a recipe for constructing Gettier cases:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen">Start with an
example of a case where a subject has a justified false belief that
also meets condition <em>X</em>.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen">Modify the case so
that the belief is true merely by luck.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Zagzebski suggests that the resultant case will always represent an
intuitive lack of knowledge. So any non-redundant addition to the JTB
theory will leave the Gettier problem
 unsolved.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 We may illustrate the application of the recipe using one of
Zagzebski&rsquo;s own examples, refuting an attempt by Alvin Plantinga
(1996) to solve the Gettier problem. Plantinga added a fourth
condition, according to which, for a belief to be knowledge the
subject&rsquo;s belief-producing faculties must be working properly in
an appropriate environment.</p>

<p>
In step one of Zagzebski&rsquo;s procedure, we imagine a case in which
a subject&rsquo;s faculties are working properly in an appropriate
environment, but the ensuing belief, though justified, is false.
Zagzebski invites us to imagine that Mary has good eyesight&mdash;good
enough for her cognitive faculties typically to yield knowledge that
her husband is sitting in the living room. Such faculties, even when
working properly in suitable environments, however, are not
infallible&mdash;if they were, the condition would not be independent
from truth&mdash;so we can imagine a case in which they go wrong.
Perhaps this is an unusual instance in which Mary&rsquo;s
husband&rsquo;s brother, who looks a lot like the husband, is in the
living room, and Mary concludes, on the basis of the proper function
of her visual capacity, that her husband is in the living room. This
belief, since false, is certainly not knowledge.</p>

<p>
In step two, we imagine Mary&rsquo;s misidentification of the occupant
of the living room as before, but add to the case that the husband is,
by luck, also in the living room. Now Mary&rsquo;s belief is true, but
intuitively, it is no more an instance of knowledge than the false
belief in the first step was. Indeed, we have constructed a case quite
like the standard counterexamples to the tripartite theory.</p>

<p>
Since the recipe is a general one, it appears to be applicable to any
condition one might add to the JTB theory, so long as it does not
itself entail truth. The argument generalizes against all
&ldquo;non-redundant&rdquo; JTB+<em>X</em> analyses.</p>

<p>
One potential response to Zagzebski&rsquo;s argument, and the failure
of the Gettier project more generally, would be to conclude that
knowledge is unanalyzable. Although it would represent a significant
departure from much analytic epistemology of the late 20<sup>th</sup>
century, it is not clear that this is ultimately a particularly
radical suggestion. Few concepts of interest have proved susceptible
to traditional analysis (Fodor 1998). One prominent approach to
knowledge in this vein is discussed in
 <a href="#VirtTheoAppr">&sect;11</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Another possible line is the one mentioned in
 <a href="#LighKnow">&sect;2</a>:
 to strengthen the justification condition to rule out Gettier cases
as justified. In order for this strategy to prevent Zagzebski&rsquo;s
recipe from working, one would need to posit a justification condition
that precludes the possibility of step one above&mdash;the only
obvious way to do this is for justification to entail truth. If it
does, then it will of course be impossible to start with a case that
has justified false belief. This kind of approach is not mainstream,
but it does have its defenders&mdash;see, e.g., Sturgeon 1993 and
Merricks 1995. Julien Dutant (2015) argues that such an approach
better reflects the history of epistemology than contemporary
fallibilist approaches to justification do. Jonathan Sutton (2007) and
Clayton Littlejohn (2012) defend factive approaches to justification
on other grounds.</p>

<p>
A third avenue of response would be to consider potential analyses of
knowledge that are not of the nonredundant form JTB+<em>X</em>.
Indeed, we have already seen some such attempts, albeit unsuccessful
ones. For instance, the causal theory of knowledge includes a clause
requiring that the belief that <em>P</em> be caused by the fact that
<em>P</em>. This condition entails both belief and truth, and so is
not susceptible to Zagzebski&rsquo;s recipe. (As we&rsquo;ve seen, it
falls to Gettier-style cases on other grounds.) One family of
strategies along these lines would build into an analysis of knowledge
a prohibition on epistemic luck directly; let us consider this sort of
move in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="EpisLuck">8. Epistemic Luck</h2>

<p>
If the problem illustrated by Gettier cases is that JTB and JTB+
analyses are compatible with a degree of epistemic luck that is
inconsistent with knowledge, a natural idea is to amend one&rsquo;s
analysis of knowledge by including an explicit &ldquo;anti-luck&rdquo;
condition. Zagzebski herself outlines this option (1994: 72). Peter
Unger (1968) gives an early analysis of this kind. For example:</p>

<div class="indent" style="margin-bottom:10px">

<p>
<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> iff</p>

<ol>

<li>It is true that <em>P</em>;</li>

<li><em>S</em> believes that <em>P</em>;</li>

<li><em>S</em> is justified in believing that <em>P</em>.</li>

<li><em>S</em>&rsquo;s belief is not true merely by luck.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
The first thing to note about this analysis is that it is
&ldquo;redundant&rdquo; in the sense described in the previous
section; the fourth condition entails the first
 two.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 So its surface form notwithstanding, it actually represents a
significant departure from the JTB+ analyses. Rather than composing
knowledge from various independent components, this analysis demands
instead that the epistemic states are related to one another in
substantive ways.</p>

<p>
The anti-luck condition, like the safety condition of the previous
section, is vague as stated. For one thing, whether a belief is true
by luck comes in degrees&mdash;just how much luck does it take to be
inconsistent with knowledge? Furthermore, it seems, independently of
questions about degrees of luck, we must distinguish between different
<em>kinds</em> of luck. Not all epistemic luck is incompatible with
having knowledge. Suppose someone enters a raffle and wins an
encyclopedia, then reads various of its entries, correcting many of
their previous misapprehensions. There is a straightforward sense in
which the resultant beliefs are true only by luck&mdash;for our
subject was very lucky to have won that raffle&mdash;but this is not
the sort of luck, intuitively, that interferes with the possession of
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Furthermore, there is a sense in which our ordinary perceptual beliefs
are true by luck, since it is possible for us to have been the victim
of a Cartesian demon and so we are, in some sense, lucky not to be.
But unless we are to capitulate to radical skepticism, it seems that
this sort of luck, too, ought to be considered compatible with
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Duncan Pritchard (2016) suggests that it might be better to express
some of these ideas in terms of risk, rather than luck: one&rsquo;s
belief isn&rsquo;t knowledge if there was too much risk of one having
formed a false belief. For discussion, see Navarro (2023) or
Hirvel&auml; (2025). These subtleties have received renewed attention
in recent decades, but they were also a focus in antiquity, especially
in the Indian Ny&#257;ya tradition. See e.g., Das (2021b) on
Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya&rsquo;s 14th-century treatment
of epistemic luck.</p>

<p>
As was the case for the safety condition discussed in
 <a href="#">&sect;5.3</a>,
 one challenge for proponents of an anti-luck or anti-risk condition
on knowledge is to specify the relevant notions&mdash;of luck, or of
risk&mdash;in terms clear enough to make adequate predictions with
intuitively plausible extensions. And if it is to serve in the
analysis of knowledge, it is also important to explain the relevant
notion of luck or risk without invoking knowledge. The challenge is,
in effect, to state an analysis that is at once plausible,
informative, and noncircular.</p>

<h2 id="MethOpti">9. Methodological Options</h2>

<p>
As our discussion so far makes clear, one standard way of evaluating
attempted analyses of knowledge has given a central role to testing it
against intuitions about cases. In the late 20<sup>th</sup> century,
the perceived lack of progress towards an acceptable
analysis&mdash;including the considerations attributed to Zagzebski in
 <a href="#KnowAnal">&sect;7</a>
 above&mdash;led some epistemologists to pursue other methodological
strategies. (No doubt, a wider philosophical trend away from
&ldquo;conceptual analysis&rdquo; more broadly also contributed to
this change.) Some of the more recent attempts to analyse knowledge
have been motivated in part by broader considerations about the role
of knowledge, or of discourse about knowledge.</p>

<p>
One important view of this sort is that defended by Edward Craig
(1990). Craig&rsquo;s entry-point into the analysis of knowledge was
not intuitions about cases, but rather a focus on the role that the
concept of knowledge plays for humans. In particular, Craig suggested
that the point of using the category of knowledge was for people to
flag reliable informants&mdash;to help people know whom to trust in
matters epistemic. Craig defends an account of knowledge that is
designed to fill this role, even though it is susceptible to intuitive
counterexamples. The plausibility of such accounts, with a less
intuitive extension but with a different kind of theoretical
justification, is a matter of controversy.</p>

<p>
Another view worth mentioning in this context is that of Hilary
Kornblith (2002), which has it that knowledge is a natural kind, to be
analysed the same way other scientific kinds are. Intuition has a role
to play in identifying paradigms, but generalizing from there is an
empirical, scientific matter, and intuitive counterexamples are to be
expected.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;knowledge first&rdquo; stance is also connected to these
methodological issues. See
 <a href="#KnowFirs">&sect;11</a>
 below.</p>

<h2 id="VirtTheoAppr">10. Virtue-Theoretic Approaches</h2>

<p>
The virtue-theoretic approach to knowledge is in some respects similar
to the safety and anti-luck approaches. Indeed, Sosa, one of the most
prominent authors of the virtue-theoretic approach emphasized safety
as part of his characterization of virtue. The virtue approach treats
knowledge as a particularly successful or valuable form of belief, and
explicates what it is to be knowledge in such terms. Like the
anti-luck theory, a virtue-theoretic theory leaves behind the JTB+
project of identifying knowledge with a truth-functional combination
of independent epistemic properties; knowledge, according to this
approach, requires a certain non-logical relationship between belief
and truth.</p>

<h3 id="AAAEval">10.1 The &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; Evaluations</h3>

<p>
Sosa has often (e.g., Sosa 2007: ch. 2) made use of an analogy of a
skilled archer shooting at a target; we may find it instructive as
well. Here are two ways in which an archer&rsquo;s shot might be
evaluated:</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>Was the shot successful? Did it hit its target?</li>

<li>Did the shot&rsquo;s execution <em>manifest</em> the
archer&rsquo;s skill? Was it produced in a way that makes it likely to
succeed?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The kind of success at issue in (1) Sosa calls <em>accuracy</em>.
The kind of skill discussed in (2) Sosa calls
<em>adroitness</em>. A shot is adroit if it is produced skillfully.
Adroit shots needn&rsquo;t be accurate, as not all skilled shots
succeed. And accurate shots needn&rsquo;t be adroit, as some unskilled
shots are lucky.</p>

<p>
In addition to accuracy and adroitness, Sosa suggests that there is
another respect in which a shot may be evaluated, relating the two.
This, Sosa calls <em>aptness</em>.</p>

<ol start="3">

<li>Did the shot&rsquo;s <em>success</em> manifest the archer&rsquo;s
skill?</li>
</ol>

<p>
A shot is apt if it is accurate <em>because</em> adroit. Aptness
entails, but requires more than, the conjunction of accuracy and
adroitness, for a shot might be both successful and skillful without
being apt. For example, if a skillful shot is diverted by an
unexpected gust of wind, then redirected towards the target by a
second lucky gust, its ultimate accuracy does not manifest the skill,
but rather reflects the lucky coincidence of the wind.</p>

<p>
Sosa suggests that this &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; model of evaluation is
applicable quite generally for the evaluation of any action or object
with a characteristic aim. In particular, it is applicable to belief
with respect to its aim at truth:</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>A belief is <em>accurate</em> if and only if it is true.</li>

<li>A belief is <em>adroit</em> if and only if it is produced
 skillfully.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>A belief is <em>apt</em> if and only if it is true in a way
manifesting, or attributable to, the believer&rsquo;s skill.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sosa identifies knowledge with apt belief, so
 understood.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 Knowledge entails both truth (accuracy) and justification
(adroitness), on this view, but they are not merely independent
components out of which knowledge is truth-functionally composed. It
requires that the skill explain the success. This is in some respects
similar to the anti-luck condition we have examined above, in that it
legislates that the relation between justification and truth be no
mere coincidence. However, insofar as Sosa&rsquo;s &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;
model is generally applicable in a way going beyond epistemology,
there are perhaps better prospects for understanding the relevant
notion of aptness in a way independent of understanding knowledge
itself than we found for the notion of epistemic luck.</p>

<h3 id="FakeBarnCase">10.2 Fake Barn Cases</h3>

<p>
Understanding knowledge as apt belief accommodates Gettier&rsquo;s
traditional counterexamples to the JTB theory rather
straightforwardly. When Smith believes that either Jones owns a Ford
or Brown is in Barcelona, the accuracy of his belief is not
attributable to his inferential skills (which the case does not call
into question). Rather, unlucky circumstances (the misleading evidence
about Jones&rsquo;s car) have interfered with his skillful cognitive
performance, just as the first diverting gust of wind interfered with
the archer&rsquo;s shot. Compensating for the unlucky interference, a
lucky circumstance (Brown&rsquo;s coincidental presence in Barcelona)
renders the belief true after all, similar to the way in which the
second gust of wind returns the archer&rsquo;s arrow back onto the
proper path towards the target.</p>

<p>
Fake barn cases, by contrast, may be less easily accommodated by
Sosa&rsquo;s AAA approach. When Henry looks at the only real barn in a
countryside full of barn facades, he uses a generally reliable
perceptual faculty for recognizing barns, and he goes right in this
instance. Suppose we say the accuracy of Henry&rsquo;s belief
manifests his competence as a perceiver. If so, we would have to judge
that his belief is apt and therefore qualifies as an instance of
knowledge. That would be a problematic outcome because the intuition
the case is meant to elicit is that Henry does <em>not</em> have
knowledge. There are three ways in which an advocate of the AAA
approach might respond to this difficulty.</p>

<p>
First, AAA advocates might argue that, although Henry has a general
competence to recognize barns, he is deprived of this ability in his
current environment, precisely because he is in fake barn county.
According to a second, subtly different strategy, Henry retains a
barn-recognition competence, his current location notwithstanding,
but, due to the ubiquity of fake barns, his competence does not
manifest itself in his belief, since its truth is attributable more to
luck than to his skill in recognizing
 barns.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 Third, Sosa&rsquo;s own response to the problem is to bite the
bullet. Judging Henry&rsquo;s belief to be apt, Sosa accepts the
outcome that Henry knows there is a barn before him. He attempts to
explain away the counterintuitiveness of this result by emphasizing
the lack of a further epistemically valuable state, which he calls
&ldquo;reflective knowledge&rdquo; (see Sosa 2007: 31&ndash;32).</p>

<h2 id="KnowFirs">11. Knowledge First</h2>

<p>
Not every concept is analyzable into more fundamental terms. This is
clear both upon reflection on examples&mdash;what analysis could be
offered of <em>hydrogen</em>, <em>animal</em>, or <em>John F.
Kennedy</em>?&mdash;and on grounds of infinite regress. Why should we
think that <em>knowledge</em> has an analysis? Proponents of the
so-called &ldquo;knowledge first&rdquo; project, championed especially
by Timothy Williamson&rsquo;s 2000 book <em>Knowledge and Its
Limits</em>, typically suppose that the project of analyzing knowledge
was a mistake. Williamson does not think that knowledge is an
uninteresting state, or that the notion of knowledge is somehow
fundamentally confused. On the contrary, Williamson thinks that
knowledge is among the most fundamental psychological and
epistemological states there are. As such, it is a mistake to analyze
knowledge in terms of other, more fundamental epistemic notions,
because knowledge itself is, in at least many cases, more fundamental.
As Williamson puts it, we should put &ldquo;knowledge first&rdquo;.
Knowledge might figure into some analyses, but it will do so in the
analysans, not in the
 analysandum.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
There is no very straightforward argument for this conclusion; its
case consists largely in the attempted demonstration of the
theoretical success of the knowledge first stance. Weighing these
benefits against those of more traditional approaches to knowledge is
beyond the scope of this
 article.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Although Williamson denies that knowledge is susceptible to analysis
in the sense at issue in this article, he does think that there are
interesting and informative ways to characterize knowledge. For
example, Williamson accepts these claims:</p>

<ul>

<li>Knowledge is the most general factive mental state.</li>

<li><em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> if and only if <em>S</em>&rsquo;s
total evidence includes the proposition that <em>P</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Williamson is also careful to emphasize that the rejection of the
project of analyzing knowledge in no way suggests that there are not
interesting and informative necessary or sufficient conditions on
knowledge. The traditional ideas that knowledge entails truth, belief,
and justification are all consistent with the knowledge first project.
And Williamson (2000: 126) is explicit endorsing a safety requirement
on knowledge&mdash;just not one that serves as part of an
analysis.</p>

<p>
One point worth recognizing, then, is that one need not engage in the
ambitious project of attempting to analyze knowledge in order to have
contact with a number of interesting questions about which factors are
and are not relevant for whether a subject has knowledge. In the next
section, we consider an important contemporary debate about whether
pragmatic factors are relevant for knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="PragEncr">12. Pragmatic Encroachment</h2>

<p>
Traditional approaches to knowledge have it that knowledge has to do
with factors like truth and justification. Whether knowledge requires
safety, sensitivity, reliability, or independence from certain kinds
of luck has proven controversial. But something that all of these
potential conditions on knowledge seem to have in common is that they
have some sort of intimate connection with the truth of the relevant
belief. Although it is admittedly difficult to make the relevant
connection precise, there is an intuitive sense in which every factor
we&rsquo;ve examined as a candidate for being relevant to knowledge
has something to do with truth of the would-be knowledgeable
beliefs.</p>

<p>
In recent years, some epistemologists have argued that focus on such
truth-relevant factors leaves something important out of our picture
of knowledge. In particular, they have argued that distinctively
<em>pragmatic</em> factors are relevant to whether a subject has
knowledge. Call this thesis &ldquo;pragmatic
 encroachment&rdquo;:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>

Pragmatic Encroachment:</p>

<p style="margin: 0">
A difference in pragmatic circumstances can constitute a difference in
knowledge.</p>
</div>

<p>
The constitution claim here is important; it is trivial that
differences in pragmatic circumstances can <em>cause</em> differences
in knowledge. For example, if the question of whether marijuana use is
legal in Connecticut is more important to Sandra than it is to Daniel,
Sandra is more likely to seek out evidence, and come to knowledge,
than Daniel is. This uninteresting claim is not what is at issue.
Pragmatic encroachment theorists think that the practical importance
itself can make for a change in knowledge, without reliance on such
downstream effects as a difference in evidence-gathering activity.
Sandra and Daniel might in some sense be in <em>the same epistemic
position</em>, where the only difference is that the question is more
important to Sandra. This difference, according to pragmatic
encroachment, might make it the case that Daniel knows, but Sandra
does
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Pragmatic encroachment can be motivated by intuitions about cases.
Jason Stanley&rsquo;s 2005 book <em>Knowledge and Practical
Interests</em> argues that it is the best explanation for pairs of
cases like the following, where the contrasted cases are evidentially
alike, but differ pragmatically:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Low Stakes</strong>. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving
home on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way
home to deposit their paychecks. It is not important that they do so,
as they have no impending bills. But as they drive past the bank, they
notice that the lines inside are very long, as they often are on
Friday afternoons. Realizing that it wasn&rsquo;t very important that
their paychecks are deposited right away, Hannah says, &ldquo;I know
the bank will be open tomorrow, since I was there just two weeks ago
on Saturday morning. So we can deposit our paychecks tomorrow
morning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
<strong>High Stakes</strong>. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving
home on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way
home to deposit their paychecks. Since they have an impending bill
coming due, and very little in their account, it is very important
that they deposit their paychecks by Saturday. Hannah notes that she
was at the bank two weeks before on a Saturday morning, and it was
open. But, as Sarah points out, banks do change their hours. Hannah
says, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t know that the
bank will be open tomorrow&rdquo;. (Stanley 2005: 3&ndash;4)</p>
</div>

<p>
Stanley argues that the moral of cases like these is that in general,
the more important the question of whether <em>P</em>, the harder it
is to know that <em>P</em>. Other, more broadly theoretical, arguments
for pragmatic encroachment have been offered as well. Jeremy Fantl
&amp; Matthew McGrath (2009) argue that encroachment follows from
fallibilism and plausible principles linking knowledge and action,
while Brian Weatherson (2012, 2024) argues that the best
interpretation of decision theory requires encroachment.</p>

<p>
Pragmatic encroachment is not an analysis of knowledge; it is merely
the claim that pragmatic factors are relevant for determining whether
a subject&rsquo;s belief constitutes knowledge. Some, but not all,
pragmatic encroachment theorists will endorse a necessary
biconditional that might be interpreted as an analysis of knowledge.
For example, a pragmatic encroachment theorist might claim that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>S</em> knows that <em>P</em> if and only if no epistemic weakness
with respect to whether <em>P</em> prevents <em>S</em> from
properly using the proposition that <em>P</em> as a reason
for action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This connection between knowledge and action is similar to ones
endorsed by Fantl &amp; McGrath (2009), but it is stronger than
anything for which they argue.</p>

<p>
Pragmatic encroachment on knowledge is deeply controversial. Patrick
Rysiew (2001), Jessica Brown (2006), and Mikkel Gerken (2017) have
argued that traditional views about the nature of knowledge are
sufficient to account for the data mentioned above. Michael
Blome-Tillmann (2009a) argues that it has unacceptably
counterintuitive results, like the truth of such claims as <em>S knows
that P</em>, <em>but if it were more important, she wouldn&rsquo;t
know</em>, or <em>S knew thatP until the question became
important</em>. Stanley (2005) offers strategies for accepting such
consequences. Other, more theoretical arguments against encroachment
have also been advanced. For example, Ichikawa, Benjamin Jarvis, &amp;
Katherine Rubin (2012) argue that pragmatic encroachment is at odds
with important tenets of belief-desire psychology.</p>

<h2 id="Cont">13. Contextualism</h2>

<p>
One final topic standing in need of treatment is contextualism about
knowledge attributions, according to which the word
&ldquo;knows&rdquo; and its cognates are context-sensitive. The
relationship between contextualism and the analysis of knowledge is
not at all straightforward. Arguably, they have different subject
matters (the former a word, and the latter an epistemic relation or
mental state). Nevertheless, the methodology of theorizing about
knowledge may be helpfully informed by semantic considerations about
the language in which such theorizing takes place. And if
contextualism is correct, then a theorist of knowledge must attend
carefully to the potential for ambiguity.</p>

<p>
It is uncontroversial that many English words are context-sensitive.
The most obvious cases are indexicals, such as &ldquo;I&rdquo;,
&ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;here&rdquo;, and &ldquo;now&rdquo; (David
Kaplan (1977) gives the standard view of indexicals).</p>

<p>
The word &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to a different person, depending on
the conversational context in which it is uttered; in particular, it
depends on the person one is addressing. Other context-sensitive terms
are gradable adjectives like &ldquo;tall&rdquo;&mdash;how tall
something must be to count as &ldquo;tall&rdquo; depends on the
conversational context&mdash;and quantifiers like
&ldquo;everyone&rdquo;&mdash;which people count as part of
&ldquo;everyone&rdquo; depends on the conversational context.
Contextualists about &ldquo;knows&rdquo; think that this verb belongs
on the list of context-sensitive terms. A consequence of contextualism
is that sentences containing &ldquo;knows&rdquo; may express distinct
propositions, depending on the conversational contexts in which
they&rsquo;re uttered. This feature allows contextualists to offer an
effective, though not uncontroversial, response to skepticism. For a
more thorough overview of contextualism and its bearing on skepticism,
see Ichikawa 2017-b or Rysiew 2023.</p>

<p>
Contextualists have modeled this context-sensitivity in various ways.
DeRose (2009) has suggested that there is a context-invariant notion
of &ldquo;strength of epistemic position&rdquo;, and that how strong a
position one must be in in order to satisfy &ldquo;knows&rdquo; varies
from context to context; this is, in effect, to understand the
semantics of knowledge attributions much as we understand that of
gradable adjectives. (How much height one must have to satisfy
&ldquo;tall&rdquo; also varies from context to context.) Stewart Cohen
(1988) adopts a contextualist treatment of &ldquo;relevant
alternatives&rdquo; theory, according to which, in skeptical contexts,
but not ordinary ones, skeptical possibilities are relevant. This
aspect is retained in the view of Lewis 1996, which characterizes a
contextualist approach that is more similar to quantifiers and modals.
Blome-Tillmann 2009-b and Ichikawa 2017-a defend and develop the
Lewisian view in different ways.</p>

<p>
Contextualism and pragmatic encroachment represent different
strategies for addressing some of the same &ldquo;shifty&rdquo;
patterns of intuitive data. (In fact, contextualism was generally
developed first; pragmatic encroachment theorists were motivated in
part by the attempt to explain some of the patterns contextualists
were interested in without contextualism&rsquo;s semantic
commitments.) Although this represents a sense in which they tend to
be rival approaches, contextualism and pragmatic encroachment are by
no means inconsistent. One could think that &ldquo;knows&rdquo;
requires the satisfaction of different standards in different
contexts, and <em>also</em> think that the subject&rsquo;s practical
situation is relevant for whether a given standard is satisfied.</p>

<p>
Like pragmatic encroachment, contextualism is deeply controversial.
Critics have argued that it posits an implausible kind of semantic
error in ordinary speakers who do not recognize the putative
context-sensitivity&mdash;see Schiffer 1996 and Greenough &amp;
Kindermann 2017&mdash;and that it is at odds with plausible
theoretical principles involving knowledge&mdash;see Hawthorne 2003,
Williamson 2005, and Worsnip 2017. In addition, some of the arguments
that are used to undercut the data motivating pragmatic encroachment
are also taken to undermine the case for contextualism; see again
Rysiew 2001 and Brown 2006.</p>
