<h1>Reverse Mathematics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Feb 2, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The question of whether the use of a certain method or axiom is
necessary in order to prove a given theorem is widespread in
mathematics. Two historical examples are particularly prominent: the
parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry, and the axiom of choice in
set theory. In both cases, one demonstrates that the axiom is indeed
necessary by proving a &ldquo;reversal&rdquo; from the theorem to the
axiom: that is, by assuming the theorem and deriving the axiom from
it, relative to a set of background assumptions known as the base
theory. Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that
seeks to give precise answers to the question of which axioms are
necessary in order to prove theorems of &ldquo;ordinary
mathematics&rdquo;: roughly speaking, those concerning structures that
are either themselves countable, or which can be represented by
countable &ldquo;codes&rdquo;. This includes many fundamental theorems
of real, complex, and functional analysis, countable algebra,
countable infinitary combinatorics, descriptive set theory, and
mathematical logic. Countable codes are just sets of natural numbers,
so these theorems can be formalized in a language with minimal
expressive resources, quantifying only over natural numbers and sets
of natural numbers, known as second-order arithmetic.</p>

<p>
Formalizing theorems from diverse areas of mathematics within a
unified framework opens the door to comparing them. For example, the
Heine&ndash;Borel covering theorem, which asserts the compactness of
the closed unit interval, is equivalent to the compactness theorem for
first-order logic. The connection between these two compactness
principles is thus not merely an analogy, but a precise
correspondence: they both express the same underlying
computability-theoretic closure condition, also expressed by the set
existence principle known as weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma, which is
necessary and sufficient to prove the two theorems.</p>

<p>
Questions of necessity and sufficiency in mathematics have
historically been closely linked to issues in the foundations of
mathematics, and in particular to the foundational programs initiated
in the early twentieth century: constructivism, finitism, and
predicativism. Using reverse mathematical results to determine the
extent of the mathematics that can be developed on the basis of a
given foundational doctrine is a natural and appealing idea,
especially since many of the systems studied in reverse mathematics
have technical and historical links to those very foundational
programs. In addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, reverse
mathematics thus has a role to play in the foundations of mathematics,
as well as in addressing broader philosophical issues such as the role
of mathematics in science and the indispensability argument.</p>

<p>
This entry aims to give the reader a broad introduction to the
history, methodology, and results of the reverse mathematics program,
with a particular focus on its connections to foundational programs.
 <a href="#HistIntrReveMath">&sect;1</a>
 provides a historical introduction to reverse mathematics, tracing
its development from the nineteenth century arithmetization of
analysis, through the development of proof theory and computability
theory in the twentieth century, until its emergence as a subject in
its own right in the mid-1970s.
 <a href="#LangSecoOrdeArit">&sect;2</a>
 provides an introduction to subsystems of second-order arithmetic,
the formal systems used in reverse mathematics.
 <a href="#BaseTheo">&sect;3</a>
 introduces the base theory \(\sfRCA_0\), sketches the coding used to
represent a wide variety of mathematical objects within it, and
explains some fundamental connections between reverse mathematics and
computability theory.
 <a href="#BigFive">&sect;4</a>
 gives an overview of the other four of the Big Five subsystems:
\(\WKL_0\)
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>),
 \(\ACA_0\)
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>),
 \(\ATR_0\)
 (<a href="#AritTranRecu">&sect;4.3</a>),
 and \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\)
 (<a href="#Pi11Comp">&sect;4.4</a>),
 including some of the theorems equivalent to the characteristic
axioms of each system (weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma, arithmetical
comprehension, arithmetical transfinite recursion, and \(\Pi^1_1\)
comprehension). Building on the previous two sections,
 <a href="#FounProgReveMath">&sect;5</a>
 explores the connections between the Big Five subsystems and
traditional foundational programs including constructivism
 (<a href="#CompMathConsMathSfRC">&sect;5.1</a>),
 finitism
 (<a href="#FiniSfRC">&sect;5.2</a>&ndash;<a href="#FiniReduWKL0">&sect;5.3</a>),
 and predicativism
 (<a href="#AritDefiPred">&sect;5.4</a>&ndash;<a href="#AritTranRecuLimiPred">&sect;5.5</a>).
 The final section
 (<a href="#FurtRead">&sect;6</a>)
 suggests further reading and provides pointers to other resources on
reverse mathematics.</p>

<h2 id="HistIntrReveMath">1. A Historical Introduction to Reverse Mathematics</h2>

<h3 id="MathNeceAxioMeth">1.1 Mathematical necessity and the axiomatic method</h3>

<p>
Reverse mathematics is a relatively young subfield of mathematical
logic, having made its start in the mid-1970s as an outgrowth of
 <a href="../recursive-functions/">computability theory</a>.
 In the field&rsquo;s founding paper (Friedman 1975), Harvey Friedman
begins by asking</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What are the proper axioms to use in carrying out proofs of particular
theorems, or bodies of theorems, in mathematics? What are those formal
systems which isolate the essential principles needed to prove them?
(1975: 235)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Friedman&rsquo;s notion of the proper axioms to prove a given theorem
is one on which not only can the theorem can be proved from the
axioms, but the axioms can be proved from the theorem. Put another
way, the proper axioms are necessary in order to prove the theorem,
and not merely sufficient.</p>

<p>
In this sense, finding the proper axioms to prove a given theorem is a
long-standing endeavour in mathematics. Euclid&rsquo;s fifth
postulate, the parallel postulate, is a well-worn example. It is
necessary in order to prove many important results in Euclidean
geometry, such as the Pythagorean theorem, but mathematicians
throughout history have found the postulate disquieting. Lewis (1920)
suggests that Euclid was trying to find the right principles from
which to prove the propositions from 29 onwards, and that the parallel
postulate was in the end given as a postulate simply because no other
way to prove those propositions was found. Attempts would be made
throughout antiquity to prove the parallel postulate, notably by
Proclus, as well as in the medieval Islamic world and in the modern
period (Bonola 1912; Rosenfeld 1976 [1988]). We now know that there
was an insurmountable barrier to these attempts. As discovered
 <a href="../geometry-19th/">in the nineteenth century</a>,
 there are models of non-Euclidean geometry which satisfy the other
postulates but do not satisfy the parallel postulate. Therefore, the
parallel postulate does not follow from the others.</p>

<p>
To see that the parallel postulate is necessary to prove the
Pythagorean theorem, we need a <em>reversal</em> from theorem to
axiom. We do this by giving a proof of the parallel postulate from the
Pythagorean theorem, and thereby establishing the implication </p>

\[\text{Pythagorean theorem} \Rightarrow
\text{parallel postulate},\]

<p>
while being careful to use only the other geometrical postulates and
not reason circularly by using the parallel postulate itself. Since
the Pythagorean theorem follows from the parallel postulate, the two
statements are equivalent, modulo the other geometrical postulates.
Moreover, because the parallel postulate is independent from the other
postulates, it follows from this equivalence that the Pythagorean
theorem is too: it is true in all and only those geometries which are
Euclidean, i.e., those in which the parallel postulate holds.</p>

<p>
Hilbert&rsquo;s axiomatizations of Euclidean and non-Euclidean
geometries in his <em>Grundlagen der Geometrie</em> (1899) provided a
setting in which such proofs of equivalence between principles could
be given. In particular, Hilbert&rsquo;s axioms provided something
like a formal <em>base theory</em> which could prove the Pythagorean
theorem from the parallel postulate, and conversely. Such proofs are
now standard exercises in undergraduate geometry textbooks (e.g.,
Hartshorne 2000). Crucially, Hilbert&rsquo;s base theory does not
prove the parallel postulate: as Hilbert showed, the base theory has
analytical models (ones constructed from the real numbers) in which
the parallel postulate is true, but also ones in which it is false. On
a purely logical level, if <i>T</i> is a formal theory such that both
\(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) are provable in <i>T</i>, then <i>T</i>
proves that they are equivalent. Similarly, if both \(\neg\varphi\)
and \(\neg\psi\) are provable, then <i>T</i> also proves that
\(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) are equivalent. The independence of the
parallel postulate from Hilbert&rsquo;s base theory thus shows that
the equivalence between the parallel postulate and the Pythagorean
theorem is non-trivial, since it cannot be established on either the
trivial grounds that both are provable, or on the trivial grounds that
both are refutable.</p>

<p>
Although this entry will not engage further with the study of
equivalences in geometry, it should be noted that this field remains
alive and well. For example, the work of Pambuccian (1996, 2001, 2006,
2009) is explicitly philosophical in its motivation, and has excited
interest amongst philosophers engaged with questions of methodological
and logical purity in mathematics. Some representative pieces are
Arana (2008; Arana &amp; Mancosu 2012; Baldwin 2013; Pambuccian 2019),
Pambuccian &amp; Schact (2021). Dean (2021) engages with reverse
mathematics and the <em>Grundlagen der Geometrie</em> from a different
direction, namely their bearing on the
 <a href="../frege-hilbert/">Frege&ndash;Hilbert controversy</a>.</p>
 
<p>
A second historical precedent is the
 <a href="../axiom-choice/">axiom of choice</a>
 (AC) in set theory. Zermelo (1904) brought widespread attention to
the axiom of choice by appealing to it in his proof of the
well-ordering theorem. In the process he ignited a controversy over
the principle, which attracted a wide range of criticisms from such
mathematical luminaries as
 <a href="../poincare/">Henri Poincar&eacute;</a>
 and &Eacute;mile Borel (Moore 1982). In his response to these
criticisms, Zermelo (1908) argued that AC is &ldquo;necessary for
science&rdquo;, and in particular that there are </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
elementary and fundamental theorems and problems that, in my opinion,
could not be dealt with at all without the principle of choice.
(Zermelo 1967: 187&ndash;188) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The &ldquo;elementary and fundamental theorems and problems&rdquo; to
which Zermelo refers include such basic matters as whether the
cardinalities of two sets are always comparable. As in the case of the
Pythagorean theorem, history has borne out Zermelo&rsquo;s contention
that the axiom of choice is necessary for proving such statements, in
the sense that they imply the axiom of choice modulo the other axioms
of
 <a href="../set-theory/ZF.html">Zermelo&ndash;Fraenkel set theory</a>
 (ZF) (Jech 1973; Rubin &amp; Rubin 1963, 1985; Howard &amp; Rubin
1998). Paul Cohen&rsquo;s discovery of
 <a href="../set-theory/#For">forcing</a>
 demonstrated a further similarity with the case of the parallel
postulate, as the axiom of choice was shown to be formally independent
of the base theory ZF. The equivalence of AC with statements like the
well-ordering theorem was thereby shown to be non-trivial, just like
the equivalence of the parallel postulate with statements like the
Pythagorean theorem.</p>

<p>
However, there are substantive differences between reverse mathematics
and the study of equivalences of the axiom of choice, and equivalences
provable over ZF more generally. Reverse mathematics is concerned with
structures that can be represented by sets of natural numbers, and not
with sets of arbitrary cardinality. As we shall see in the course of
this entry, these structures and the theorems that concern them are
far more extensive than one might at first suspect, including a
substantial part of what is often called &ldquo;ordinary
mathematics&rdquo;. While the axiom of choice is equivalent to many
important general theorems in topology, functional analysis, and
combinatorics, the full generality of these results is rarely required
in everyday mathematical applications. The fundamental characterizing
theorems about &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; structures such as the real
numbers require only the axioms of weak subsystems of second-order
arithmetic. Finally, the axiom of choice is also distinguished by its
purely existential nature: it does not give a method or procedure for
choosing elements from an infinite family of sets, but merely asserts
that some such choice exists. The set existence principles studied in
reverse mathematics, on the other hand, all have a
computability-theoretic aspect and are thus closely connected to
definability, something which forms a major theme of this entry. For
principles like arithmetical comprehension
 (<a href="#AritComp">&sect;4.2</a>)
 this connection lies on the surface, while for others like weak
K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>)
 it is less immediately apparent but no less real (Eastaugh 2019).</p>

<h3 id="AritAnal">1.2 The arithmetization of analysis</h3>

<p>
Although many aspects of reverse mathematics are rooted in geometry, a
different part of mathematics supplies many others: analysis. This is
the part of mathematics concerned with the continuum of real numbers
and the many structures which are based upon it. Analysis supplies
much of the subject matter as many theorems of analysis turn out to be
equivalent to the set existence principles studied in reverse
mathematics. It also much of the reverse mathematician&rsquo;s
toolkit, namely the diverse array of coding schemes required to
represent complex objects and structures within second-order
arithmetic.</p>

<p>
Both aspects of the connection between reverse mathematics and
analysis can be traced to the nineteenth century, when mathematics in
general, and analysis in particular, underwent a sea change. One
driving force was the desire to increase the level of rigour in
mathematical analysis, replacing geometric intuition and infinitesimal
quantities with &ldquo;arithmetical&rdquo; arguments based on
 <a href="../settheory-early/">proto-set-theoretic</a>
 principles and constructions.</p>

<p>
Of the many important advances that were made during the
<em>arithmetization of analysis</em>, as it came to be called, we can
single out three as particularly fundamental: the new definitions of
convergent sequence and limit; of continuous function; and of the real
number system itself. Suppose \(x = \str{x_n : n \in \bbN}\) is an
infinite sequence of real numbers. Then the real number \(y\) is the
<em>limit</em> of the sequence \(x\), in symbols \(y = \lim_{n \to
\infty} x_n\), if for every real number \(\varepsilon \gt 0\) there
exists a natural number \(N\) such that for all natural numbers \(n
\gt N\), \(|x_n - y| \lt \varepsilon\). This definition of the notion
of a limit depends only on the concepts of real and natural numbers,
together with the arithmetical operations, absolute value, order, and
the concept of an infinite sequence: no recourse to geometrical
notions is required. This development set the stage for a more
thoroughgoing arithmetization in which the concept of a real number
was similarly reduced.</p>

<p>
Like the notions of continuity and convergence, definitions of the
real numbers underwent significant evolutions during this period.
Historically, irrational numbers had been conceived of geometrically,
for instance the square root of 2 as the length of the diagonal across
the unit square, or \(\pi\) as the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter. While the analysts who developed arithmetical
definitions of the real numbers during the nineteenth century did not
aim to eliminate this geometrical aspect, they tended to view appeals
to geometric intuition in proofs with suspicion, and wanted to give a
theory of real numbers that did not depend on such intuitive
considerations.</p>

<p>
One such theory was that of Georg Cantor, who gave a construction of
real numbers in terms of convergent sequences of rational numbers
(Cantor 1872, 1883). With some anachronism, let \(x : \bbN\to \bbQ\)
be a total function from natural numbers to rational numbers. We can
think of \(x\) as an infinite sequence of rationals \(\str{x_n : n \in
\bbN}\). \(x\) is a <em>fundamental sequence</em> if there exists \(k
\in \bbN\) such that for every positive rational number
\(\varepsilon\), \(|x_{n+m} - x_n| \lt \varepsilon\) for every \(m,n
\in \bbN\) where \(n \gt k\). We can then conventionally associate
with the fundamental sequence \(x\) the real number \(y = \lim x\),
the value that the sequence \(x\) achieves in the limit. Moreover,
Cantor showed how the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division could be extended to real numbers
considered as the limits of fundamental sequences.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../dedekind-foundations/">Richard Dedekind</a>,
 in his 1872 monograph <em>Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen</em>,
developed a substantially different approach to the real numbers as
&ldquo;cuts&rdquo; or partitions of the rational numbers into upper
and lower parts. First worked out for an introductory course that he
taught at the Z&uuml;rich Polytechnic in 1858, Dedekind&rsquo;s
approach takes the real numbers to be in correspondence not with the
limits of convergent sequences of rational numbers, but with arbitrary
&ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the rational numbers. A cut is a disjoint pair
\((A_1,A_2)\) of nonempty sets of rational numbers, such that \(A_1
\cup A_2 = \bbQ\) and \(A_1\) is downwards closed while \(A_2\) is
upwards closed: if \(p\) and \(q\) are rational numbers such that \(p
\lt q\), if \(q \in A_1\) then \(p \in A_1\), and if \(p \in A_2\)
then \(q \in A_2\). A real number \(x \in \bbR\) corresponds to, or is
&ldquo;created by&rdquo;, a cut \((A_1,A_2)\) just in case for every
\(p \in A_1\), \(p \leq x\), and for every \(q \in A_2\), \(x \lt
q\).</p>

<p>
Despite their conceptual differences, Dedekind and Cantor&rsquo;s
constructions have much in common. They both take the rational numbers
as the basis for the real numbers, together with some set-theoretic
machinery. In Dedekind&rsquo;s case this involves the notion of an
arbitrary subset of the rational numbers, while in Cantor&rsquo;s it
is the notion of an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Talk of
rational numbers can, as Cantor and Dedekind knew, be reduced in
principle to talk of natural numbers, and their definitions can be
seen as reducing the real numbers to the &ldquo;arithmetical&rdquo;:
the natural numbers, and some part of the theory of sets. That part is
in fact quite small, requiring only the concept of a set of natural
numbers, and both Cantor and Dedekind&rsquo;s definitions of a real
number can (with some modifications) be formalized in second-order
arithmetic (see
 <a href="#InteRatiRealNumb">&sect;3.3</a>
 for the former and Simpson (1984) for the latter).</p>

<p>
In addition to its groundbreaking definition of the real numbers as
cuts in the rationals, and its formulation of the principle of
continuity as the essential axiom of the arithmetical continuum,
Dedekind (1872) also contains a striking anticipation of the method of
reversals, as first noted by Sieg (1988: 344, fn. 16). The final
section of <em>Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen</em> is devoted to
fundamental theorems of analysis, namely the monotone convergence
theorem and the Cauchy convergence theorem. Dedekind shows that not
only can the principle of continuity be used to derive these theorems,
but that the theorems can in turn be used to derive the principle of
continuity.</p>

<p>
From this point onwards, the story of arithmetization becomes bound up
with the story of logic. The development of quantificational logic by
Frege and Pierce, the symbolism of Peano, and the development of type
theory by Russell all played important parts in the emergence of a
recognizably modern framework suited for the formalization of
arithmetic and analysis in the work of the Hilbert school, most
notably in Hilbert&rsquo;s collaborations with Wilhelm Ackermann and
Paul Bernays. These culminated in Hilbert and Bernays&rsquo;s
monumental <em>Grundlagen der Mathematik</em>, published in two
volumes (1934, 1939). Interested readers may have an easier time
obtaining the second editions (1968, 1970).</p>

<p>
Amongst the many contributions of Hilbert and Bernays&rsquo;s
<em>Grundlagen</em> to the foundations of mathematics, the most
obvious immediate connection with reverse mathematics and the study of
subsystems of second-order arithmetic comes in Supplement IV of volume
2 (1939/1970). This supplement introduces several formalisms for
arithmetic which can be seen as ancestors of the axiom system
\(\sfZ_2\) of second-order arithmetic used in reverse mathematics,
defined in
 <a href="#AxioSecoOrdeArit">&sect;2.3</a>
 of this entry. The bulk of Supplement IV uses a system <i>H</i> which
includes both free and bound first- and second-order variables. The
intended range of the first-order variables is the natural numbers.
The second-order terms are unary function terms, not set or predicate
terms, and the intended interpretation of the second-order variables
is as functions \(f : \bbN\to \bbN\) (Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1970:
467). These aspects of the formalism are quite similar to the language
\(\calL_2\) of second-order arithmetic, but in other respects the
system <i>H</i> diverges quite markedly from contemporary practice.
One aspect is the inclusion of free formula variables, which some
authors such as Sanders (2022: 2) have interpreted as introducing
third-order parameters and operators into the system. Another is that
the system uses a form of Hilbert&rsquo;s
 <a href="../epsilon-calculus/">epsilon calculus</a>,
 although the revised formalism <i>K</i> introduced in section F of
Supplement IV shows how the system <i>H</i> can be modified to remove
this dependency. The use of function terms, rather than set terms,
persisted into later work such as that of Grzegorczyk, Mostowski,
&amp; Ryll-Nardzewski (1958), but in fact Hilbert and Bernays also
define in section G of Supplement IV a system <i>L</i> which exchanges
the free and bound function variables for free and bound formula
variables.</p>

<p>
Having set up their formal system <i>H</i> of higher-order arithmetic,
Hilbert and Bernays proceed to formalize a substantial fragment of
real analysis within it, including showing that a version of the least
upper bound principle holds. They comment explicitly (Hilbert &amp;
Bernays 1970: 482) that the possibility of representing sequences of
real numbers by individual number-theoretic functions, as is now done
in reverse mathematics by individual sets of natural numbers (see
 <a href="#InteRatiRealNumb">&sect;3.3</a>
 for details), depends on being able to define an invertible mapping
from (countable) sequences of number-theoretic functions onto the
individual number-theoretic functions, which itself arises from the
invertible mapping from pairs of natural numbers to individual
numbers. The existence and use of such representations can be
understood as a continuation of the tradition of arithmetization
developed in the nineteenth century, albeit now within a
precisely-delimited formal system rather than within informal
mathematics.</p>

<p>
Arithmetization can thus be understood as an essential component of
the development of reverse mathematics, since it shows how to reduce
complex mathematical notions such as real numbers, continuous
functions, measures and so on to more basic ones, namely the notion of
natural number and the notion of collection or set. This reductive
spirit retains its importance throughout the history of reverse
mathematics, although it manifests itself in a number of different
ways. One is through
 <a href="../hilbert-program/">Hilbert&rsquo;s program</a>
 of reducing infinitary to finitary mathematics, and its continuation
through the
 <a href="../proof-theory/#HilbProgExte">reductive program</a>
 in proof theory. Another is the omnipresent use of coding to
represent a wide variety of mathematical objects within the seemingly
austere ontology of second-order arithmetic (see particularly
 <a href="#PairSequBasiCodi">&sect;3.2</a>&ndash;<a href="#InteRatiRealNumb">&sect;3.3</a>
 for an introduction to the essentials of coding in reverse
mathematics).</p>

<p>
For readers with an interest in tracing the development of
second-order arithmetic in more detail, from the work of Hilbert and
Bernays on, the work of Dean &amp; Walsh (2017) is an important
starting point. Sieg &amp; Ravaglia (2005) review the contents of the
two volumes of the first edition of the <em>Grundlagen der
Mathematik</em>, albeit without much discussion of Supplement IV.
Hilbert&rsquo;s lectures on the foundations of arithmetic and logic
(Ewald &amp; Sieg 2013) also provide much more detail on the
development of the ideas that ultimately appeared in the
<em>Grundlagen</em>. Sieg (1984, 2020) provides detailed accounts of
some of the conceptual advances related in this section, and their
philosophical ramifications. Additional references can be found in the
bibliography of the entry on

<h3 id="RecuCounReveMath">1.3 From recursive counterexamples to reverse mathematics</h3>

<p>
Although it has deep roots in the work of the Hilbert school
 (<a href="#AritAnal">&sect;1.2</a>),
 reverse mathematics is perhaps best understood methodologically (as
well as historically) as an outgrowth of computability theory, and of
definability theory more generally. In particular, the method of
reversals can be seen as originating in the tradition of <em>recursive
counterexamples</em> to classical theorems. These are computable
objects which witness the failure of classical mathematical theorems
when their quantifiers are restricted to computable (recursive)
objects. A characteristic example of a recursive counterexample is a
<em>Specker sequence</em>: a computable, bounded increasing sequence
of real numbers with no computable limit. Specker sequences are
recursive counterexamples to theorems like the monotone convergence
theorem and the Bolzano&ndash;Weierstra&szlig; theorem.</p>

<p>
Specker (1949) refrained from drawing explicit philosophical
conclusions from his results, but it seems clear that he understood
them as applying not only to computable analysis, but also to
constructive mathematics. This was a common attitude amongst logicians
of the time: because the formal notion of a recursive function allows
us to gives a precise mathematical characterization of the informal
notions of algorithm and effective procedure, it was natural to
postulate that it could also allow us to understand the informal
notion of a mathematical construction. The use of computability theory
to study constructive mathematics was pioneered by Kleene with his
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/#ReaSemForHeyAri">realizability interpretation</a>
 for intuitionistic logic (Kleene 1945). Kleene&rsquo;s work on
realizability and on Brouwer&rsquo;s fan theorem (Kleene 1952) led to
his construction of the <em>Kleene tree</em>, a computable tree with
no computable path, which was important for the discovery of the
computability-theoretic properties of weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma.
An independent but equally important development was that of recursive
constructive mathematics within Markov&rsquo;s school in Russia, which
also sought to understand the concept of a construction in terms of
the concept of recursive function (Nagorny 1994; Kushner 2006;
Moschovakis to appear).</p>

<p>
Many constructivists either accept a form of
 <a href="../church-turing/">Church&rsquo;s thesis</a>&mdash;the
 claim that every constructive process is extensionally equivalent, in
terms of its outputs, to a computable function&mdash;or accept a
system which is consistent with it. Theorems like the monotone
convergence theorem are not compatible with this approach, because as
Specker discovered, there are computable (and thus constructive)
bounded sequences of rational numbers with no computable limit.
Therefore, the limit of a Specker sequence does not exist for the
constructivist, not only because it implies the falsity of the
constructive Church&rsquo;s thesis, but also because it implies a
principle known as the <em>limited principle of omniscience</em> (or
LPO), a weakening of the law of the excluded middle which
constructivists typically also deny (Mandelkern 1988, 1989).</p>

<p>
The discovery that classical mathematical theorems like the monotone
convergence theorem or K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma implied the existence
of non-computable sets was a major step towards reverse mathematics.
This was because such results typically give more information than
merely the existence of a non-computable set: they show the existence
of non-computable sets of a particular complexity, lying at a certain
point in the
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#AritAnalHier">arithmetical or analytical hierarchies</a>.
 For example, Specker&rsquo;s proof shows that the existence of limits
of bounded sequences of rational numbers implies the existence of the
set <i>K</i> of codes for Turing machines which halt on every input.
This is the idea underlying the reversal from the monotone convergence
theorem to arithmetical comprehension.</p>

<p>
The 1950s saw further interest in the use of tools from computability
theory (then known as recursive function theory) and definability
theory more generally in studying the foundational programs from
earlier in the century such as intuitionism, finitism, and
predicativism. All of them were viewed as involving a greater or
lesser degree of constructivism, and this naturally led to an attempt
to analyse them in terms of definable classes of sets or functions of
natural numbers and real numbers. The most basic was the
identification of the class of computable real numbers as a model for
constructive mathematics (Mostowski 1959). The arithmetical sets were
also studied, by Grzegorczyk (1955), Kond&ocirc; (1958), and Mostowski
(1959), as providing a natural model for the predicativism of Weyl
(1918)
 (<a href="#AritDefiPred">&sect;5.4</a>).
 Following Bernays (1935), more platonistic theories were associated
with more encompassing notions of computability or definability (Dean
&amp; Walsh 2017: 2.2&ndash;2.3). Perhaps the culmination of this
movement was Kreisel&rsquo;s tentative proposal in 1960 to identify
the predicatively definable sets with the class of hyperarithmetical
sets
 (<a href="#AritTranRecuLimiPred">&sect;5.5</a>),
 and his associated work on the Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem, which
he showed was false when its quantifiers were restricted to the
hyperarithmetical sets (Kreisel 1959). Kreisel&rsquo;s result can be
understood as a recursive counterexample, and indeed a
hyperarithmetical counterexample, to the Cantor&ndash;Bendixson
theorem. Internalising the result led to the proof of the equivalence
between the Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem and the axiom scheme of
\(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension
 (<a href="#Pi11Comp">&sect;4.4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The work of Errett Bishop in the 1960s also exerted an influence on
reverse mathematics. The revival of interest in constructivism
following the 1967 publication of Bishop&rsquo;s <em>Foundations of
Constructive Analysis</em> and his forceful advocacy for a
constructive approach to mathematics led to new work on the limits of
constructive mathematics. Many of the recursive counterexamples to
classical theorems discovered in the 1970s and 1980s were later
transformed into proofs of reversals from those theorems to
non-constructive set existence principles. For example, Brown and
Simpson&rsquo;s (1986) reversal of the Hahn&ndash;Banach theorem for
separable Banach spaces to weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>)
 is based on a recursive counterexample to the Hahn&ndash;Banach
theorem due to Metakides, Nerode, &amp; Shore (1985), who were in turn
inspired by a Brouwerian counterexample to the Hahn&ndash;Banach
theorem constructed by Bishop himself.</p>

<h3 id="EarlDeveReveMath">1.4 The early development of reverse mathematics</h3>

<p>
Despite its many antecedents, reverse mathematics as a distinctive
discipline, with a specific formal setting and methodology, did not
emerge until the mid-1970s. Its emergence can be traced quite
precisely, to Harvey Friedman&rsquo;s talk at the 1974 International
Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver. Entitled &ldquo;Some Systems
of Second Order Arithmetic and Their Use&rdquo;, and published in the
Proceedings of the ICM (Friedman 1975), Friedman&rsquo;s paper
presents a vision of reverse mathematics that is strikingly close to
the mature program described in the main sections of this entry. The
formal setting is that of second-order arithmetic and its subsystems,
and the Big Five subsystems (\(\sfRCA_0\), \(\WKL_0\), \(\ACA_0\),
\(\ATR_0\), and \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\)) and their characteristic
axioms are all present.</p>

<p>
Friedman&rsquo;s ICM paper presented a range of equivalences with the
members of the Big Five, modulo a base theory \(\rmRCA\) that only
proved the existence of computable sets. Amongst the statements
studied were formalizations of the fundamental theorems of analysis
from the final chapter of Dedekind&rsquo;s <em>Stetigkeit und
irrationale Zahlen</em> (1872), all of which are provably equivalent
to one another and to the axiom scheme of arithmetical comprehension,
modulo the base theory \(\rmRCA\). Specker&rsquo;s proof that there
exist computable bounded sequences of rational numbers whose limits
compute the halting problem was thus transformed into a proof that the
sequential completeness and sequential compactness of the real line
are equivalent to the existence of arithmetically definable sets.</p>

<p>
On a technical level, the most substantial difference between the
formalism of Friedman&rsquo;s (1975) paper and that used in
contemporary reverse mathematical practice is that his base theory
\(\rmRCA\) includes the full induction scheme (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}).
Friedman subsequently showed in 1976 that the equivalences of his 1975
paper could be proved within a weaker base theory called \(\rmRCA_0\),
in which the full induction scheme is replaced by quantifier-free
induction. However, in the process of weakening the induction
principle Friedman substantially changed the definition of the base
theory from that used in his earlier paper. The resulting system
\(\rmRCA_0\) is essentially a second-order version of primitive
recursive arithmetic. While formally rather different, this does
result in a system that is proof-theoretically very close to the
now-standard base theory \(\sfRCA_0\)
 (<a href="#BaseTheo">&sect;3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The modern form of \(\sfRCA_0\) first appears in print in an
influential paper by Friedman, Simpson, and Smith (1983), with the
axioms of \(\PA^-\) for \(\bbN\) as an ordered semiring, the recursive
comprehension axiom scheme, and the \(\Sigma^0_1\) induction scheme.
By 1983 reverse mathematics was thus substantially as we know it
today, even down to the use of the slogan &ldquo;reverse
mathematics&rdquo;, which Friedman coined during an AMS special
session organized by Stephen Simpson (2009: 35).</p>

<p>
The major developments that followed in the 1980s and 1990s, which saw
reverse mathematics become a major subfield of computability theory,
are to a large extent due to the work of Stephen Simpson and his
doctoral students. They systematically investigated the reverse
mathematical status of hundreds of theorems spread across many
disparate fields of mathematics, from functional analysis to
combinatorics, commutative algebra to measure theory, order theory to
general topology. Many of the fruits of this research program are
surveyed in Simpson&rsquo;s textbook, <em>Subsystems of Second Order
Arithmetic</em>, first published in 1999. A second edition was
published in 2009.</p>

<h2 id="SecoOrdeAritSubs">2. Second-Order Arithmetic and Its Subsystems</h2>

<h3 id="LangSecoOrdeArit">2.1 The language of second-order arithmetic</h3>

<p>
The language of second-order arithmetic \(\calL_2\) is a two-sorted
language which augments the language of first-order arithmetic,
familiar from systems such as Peano arithmetic, with a second sort of
variables representing sets of natural numbers. Variables of the first
sort \(x_0, x_1, x_2, \dotsc\) are called <em>number variables</em>
and are intended to range over natural numbers, while variables of the
second sort \(X_0, X_1, X_2, \dotsc\) are called <em>set
variables</em> and are intended to range over sets of natural numbers.
The nonlogical symbols of second-order arithmetic are: the constant
symbols 0 and 1; the binary function symbols \(+\) and \(\times\); and
the binary relation symbols \(\lt\) and \(\in\). A <em>numerical
term</em> is either a number variable, 0 or 1, or has the form \(t_1 +
t_2\) or \(t_1 \times t_2\) where \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are numerical
terms (the only terms of the second sort are set variables). An
<em>atomic formula</em> has the form \(t_1 = t_2\), \(t_1 \lt t_2\),
or \(t_1 \in X\), where \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are numerical terms and
\(X\) is any set variable. Second-order arithmetic can be presented
using any standard classical proof system for a two-sorted language.
The identity relation for sets is defined as coextensionality:</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\label{eq:extensionality}
    \tag{\(=_1\)}
    X = Y \Leftrightarrow \forall{n}(n \in X \leftrightarrow n \in
Y).\]

</div>

<h3 id="SemaForSecoOrdeArit">2.2 Semantics for second-order arithmetic</h3>

<p>
The name &ldquo;second-order arithmetic&rdquo; can be confusing.
Coming across it for the first time, one might easily think that its
name implies that it uses
 <a href="../logic-higher-order/">second-order logic</a>,
 which is familiar from other contexts in the philosophy of
mathematics such as
 <a href="../logicism/">logicism</a>
 and
 <a href="../structuralism-mathematics/">mathematical structuralism</a>.
 In the so-called standard semantics for second-order logic (sometimes
also called full semantics), the second-order quantifiers are
interpreted as ranging over the entire powerset of the first-order
domain. For example, in a model \(\calM\) of second-order Peano
arithmetic \(\PA^2\), i.e., Peano arithmetic formulated in
second-order logic, the range of the second-order quantifiers is
\(\powset{|\calM|}\), where \(|\calM|\) is the range of the
first-order quantifiers. It follows from Dedekind&rsquo;s categoricity
theorem that the system \(\PA^2\) only has one model up to
isomorphism. This means that, at least for second-order semantic
entailment \(\models_2\), \(\PA^2\) is semantically complete: for
every \(\varphi \in \calL_2\), either \(\PA^2 \models_2 \varphi\) or
\(\PA^2 \models_2 \neg\varphi\).</p>

<p>
It is therefore important to note that despite its name, the semantics
used in reverse mathematics for the language \(\calL_2\) of
second-order arithmetic is not the standard second-order semantics,
but the general or Henkin semantics&mdash;in other words, those of
first-order logic. An <em>\(\calL_2\)-structure</em> is an ordered
tuple of the form</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\calM = \langle
        M, \calS^\calM,
        0^\calM, 1^\calM,
        +^\calM, \times^\calM, \lt^\calM
    \rangle,\]

</div>

<p>
where \(M\) is the domain over which number variables range,
\(\calS^\calM\) is a set of subsets of \(M\) over which set variables
range, \(0^\calM\) and \(1^\calM\) are distinguished elements of
\(M\), \(+^\calM\) and \(\times^\calM\) are binary operations on
\(M\), and \(\lt^\calM\) is a binary relation on \(M\). The domains
\(M\) and \(\calS^\calM\) are always assumed to be disjoint and
nonempty.</p>

<p>
Since the range of the second-order quantifiers can be any nonempty
set \(\calS^\calM \subseteq \powset{|\calM|}\), there are many
non-isomorphic \(\calL_2\)-structures. Adding axioms does not change
this situation: both the formal system of second-order arithmetic
\(\sfZ_2\) (introduced in
 <a href="#AxioSecoOrdeArit">&sect;2.3</a>)
 and its subsystems have many non-isomorphic models. Departing from
the standard semantics of second-order logic is in fact an essential
part of reverse mathematics, since in order to prove that a principle
\(T_0\) does not imply another principle \(T_1\), one must prove that
there is a model \(\calM\) such that \(\calM \models T_0\) and \(\calM
\not\models T_1\). If every subsystem we considered had the same
unique model, this would be impossible.</p>

<p>
A basic example is provided by the \(\calL_2\)-structure</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\calR = \langle
        \omega, \REC, 0, 1, +, \cdot, \lt
    \rangle.\]

</div>

<p>
where \(\REC= \set{ X : X \text{ is computable}}\). Here \(\omega\) is
the standard natural numbers \(0,1,2,\dotsc\), and the symbols
\(0,1,+,\cdot,\lt\) have their standard interpretations. \(\calR\) is
thus what is known as an <em>\(\omega\)-model</em>, one whose
<em>first-order part</em> is the standard natural numbers.
\(\omega\)-models are thus distinguished from one another entirely by
their <em>second-order parts</em>. In the case of \(\calR\), its
second-order part consists of \(\REC\), the set of all computable sets
of natural numbers. Since different \(\omega\)-models differ from one
another only in their second-order parts, they are frequently referred
to by the names for those parts. The remainder of this essay will
consequently refer to \(\calR\) as \(\REC\), the \(\omega\)-model
\(\calA\) whose second-order part consists of the arithmetically
definable sets will be referred to as \(\ARITH\), and so on.</p>

<p>
Although many classical mathematical principles such as the
intermediate value theorem \(\IVT\) are true in \(\REC\), others are
not, such as the least upper bound axiom \(\LUB\), which is equivalent
to arithmetical comprehension
 (<a href="#AritComp">&sect;4.2</a>).
 From this we can conclude that \(\IVT\) does not entail \(\LUB\).
This model also allows us to demonstrate an instance of
incompleteness. The base theory \(\sfRCA_0\) which we will introduce
in
 <a href="#BaseTheo">&sect;3</a>
 is true in \(\REC\), and since \(\REC\not\models \LUB\), it follows
by the soundness theorem for first-order logic that \(\sfRCA_0
\not\vdash \LUB\). In this sense, reverse mathematics is a study of
incompleteness: it studies a hierarchy of theorems which are
equivalent to certain set existence principles, but which are not
proved either by the base theory or by strictly weaker principles in
the hierarchy (Simpson 2010; Eastaugh 2019).</p>

the induction axiom (\ref{eq:ind_axiom}), \(\sfZ_2\) can prove the
<em>induction scheme</em>, which consists of the universal closures
of</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\label{eq:ind_scheme}
    \tag{\(\Pi^1_\infty\text{-}\sfIND\)}
    (\varphi(0) \wedge \forall{n}(\varphi(n) \rightarrow \varphi(n +
1)))
    \rightarrow

where \(\varphi(n)\) is any \(\calL_2\)-formula.</p>

<p>
Second-order arithmetic is sometimes referred to as the first-order
theory of analysis, since the set variables can be interpreted as
ranging over real numbers. Many older presentations employ a
functional calculus where set variables are replaced by variables
\(f^k\) for <i>k</i>-ary functions \(f : \bbN^k \rightarrow \bbN\).
Grzegorczyk, Mostowski, and Ryll-Nardzewski (1958) present such a
system, which also includes a
 <a href="../pm-notation/#DefiDesc">definite description operator</a>
 \(\iota\) and a form of the comprehension scheme which they call the
 <a href="../lesniewski/">Le&#347;niewski</a>
 schemata. In general, results about these variant systems transfer
smoothly from one to another with only minor adjustments.</p>

<p>
A <em>subsystem of second-order arithmetic</em> is an axiom system
\(T\) where every axiom \(\varphi \in T\) is an \(\calL_2\)-sentence
provable in \(\sfZ_2\). Of the many subsystems of second-order
arithmetic which have been studied, five are of central importance in
reverse mathematics, and are known colloquially as the &ldquo;Big
Five&rdquo;. The first of these is the system \(\sfRCA_0\), which is
the standard base theory for reverse mathematics. The other members of
the Big Five (\(\WKL_0\), \(\ACA_0\), \(\ATR_0\), and
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\)) are proper extensions of \(\sfRCA_0\), and
are each equivalent over the base theory \(\sfRCA_0\) to a multitude
of ordinary mathematical theorems from analysis, algebra, infinitary
combinatorics, logic, and topology. Each of these systems has greater
proof-theoretic strength than the preceding one, in the sense that
they prove theorems that are not provable in the preceding system:
\(\WKL_0\) proves more theorems than \(\sfRCA_0\), \(\ACA_0\) proves
more than \(\WKL_0\), \(\ATR_0\) proves more than \(\ACA_0\), and
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) proves more than \(\ATR_0\). Note that this
ordering by inclusion is not the same as the consistency strength
ordering: while most members of the Big Five prove the consistency of
the preceding system, this does not hold in the case of \(\sfRCA_0\)
and \(\WKL_0\), which are equiconsistent by the conservativity results
discussed in
 <a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The &ldquo;0&rdquo; subscript at the end of these systems&rsquo; names
means that the principle of induction is restricted. In the case of
\(\ACA_0\) and stronger systems like \(\ATR_0\) and
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\), this restriction involves them containing
only the induction <em>axiom</em> (\ref{eq:ind_axiom}), not the
induction <em>scheme</em> (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}). They can therefore
only prove instances of the induction scheme where they can prove that
the corresponding set exists: for example, \(\ACA_0\) can prove any
instance of the induction scheme where the formula involved is
arithmetical (i.e., it does not contain any set quantifiers), while
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) can prove any instance of the induction
scheme where the formula involved is \(\Pi^1_1\). In the case of
systems weaker than \(\ACA_0\) like \(\sfRCA_0\) and \(\WKL_0\), the
induction axiom is too weak for the systems to be able to do much
mathematically. They are therefore augmented by the <em>\(\Sigma^0_1\)
induction scheme</em>, which is the restriction of
(\ref{eq:ind_scheme}) to \(\Sigma^0_1\) formulas, those of the form
\(\exists{x}\theta(x)\) where \(x\) is a number variable, and
\(\theta\) contains only bound number quantifiers and no set
quantifiers, although it may contain free and bound number and set
variables.</p>

<p>
In the next two sections we will take a closer look at the Big Five
subsystems, including the mathematics that can be done in each of them
but not in a weaker subsystem, as well as some illuminating details of
their model-theoretic and proof-theoretic properties. The close
connections between reverse mathematics and computability theory mean
that it will sometimes be useful to refer to relevant sections of the
entry on
 <a href="../recursive-functions/">recursive functions</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="BaseTheo">3. The Base Theory</h2>

<h3 id="RecuComp">3.1 Recursive comprehension</h3>

<p>
The subsystems of second-order arithmetic used in reverse mathematics
are typically defined by replacing the comprehension scheme
(\ref{eq:full_comp_scheme}) with a weaker axiom. The most fundamental
of these subsystems is called \(\sfRCA_0\), where RCA stands for
&ldquo;recursive comprehension axiom&rdquo; and the 0 subscript
indicates that its induction principle is restricted. The axioms of
\(\sfRCA_0\) consist of the basic axioms; the recursive (or
\(\Delta^0_1\)) comprehension scheme consisting of the universal
closures of all formulas of the form</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\label{eq:rca}
    \tag{\(\Delta^0_1\text{-}\CA\)}
    \forall{n}(\varphi(n) \leftrightarrow \psi(n))
    \rightarrow \exists{X}\forall{n}(n \in X \leftrightarrow
\varphi(n))\]

</div>

<p>
where \(\varphi(n)\) is a \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula and \(\psi(n)\) is a
\(\Pi^0_1\)-formula, both of which may have additional free number and
set variables; and the \(\Sigma^0_1\)-induction scheme, which is the
restriction of the induction scheme (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}) to
\(\Sigma^0_1\)-formulas. The name &ldquo;recursive
comprehension&rdquo; refers to the fact that the
\(\Delta^0_1\)-definable subsets of \(\omega\) are exactly those which
are
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#CompCompEnumSets"><em>recursive</em></a>
 (in contemporary terminology, <em>computable</em>), or to use another
extensionally equivalent characterization, <em>Turing computable</em>
(this is
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#postthm">Post&rsquo;s theorem</a>).
 \(\sfRCA_0\) is the base theory for most of reverse mathematics:
given a theorem \(\tau\) which is provable in some subsystem of
second-order arithmetic <i>S</i> that extends \(\sfRCA_0\), we obtain
a reversal from \(\tau\) to <i>S</i> when we show that the axioms of
<i>S</i> are provable from the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0 + \tau\).</p>

<p>
The presence of \(\Sigma^0_1\) induction in the system allows one to
derive many of the familiar algebraic properties of natural numbers:
the associativity and commutativity of addition and multiplication,
that 0 and 1 are the identity elements for addition and multiplication
respectively, and the distributivity of multiplication over addition.
These results can be summarized by saying that \(\sfRCA_0\) proves
that the system \((\bbN, +, \cdot, 0, 1, \lt)\) is a commutative
ordered semiring with cancellation; full details can be found in lemma
II.2.1 of Simpson (2009: 65&ndash;66).</p>

<h3 id="PairSequBasiCodi">3.2 Pairing, sequences, and the basics of coding</h3>

<p>
All coding, however complex and multi-layered, is ultimately built on
the techniques that allow one to code an ordered pair \(\str{a, b}\)
or a finite sequence \(\str{a_1, a_2, \dotsc, a_k}\) of natural
numbers by a single natural number \(n\) in such a way that the
components \(a\) and \(b\) or elements \(a_1, \dotsc, a_k\) can be
recovered from the code \(n\) in an effective manner. One simple
coding scheme defines the number \((a,b)\) coding the ordered pair of
numbers \(\str{a,b}\) as the number \((a + b)^2 + a\), where \(m^2\)
abbreviates \(m \times m\). Within \(\sfRCA_0\) we can verify that for
any \(a,b,a',b' \in \bbN\), if \((a,b) = (a',b')\) then \(a = a'\) and
\(b = b'\). With this pairing function in hand we can define binary
relations and single argument functions on \(\bbN\): a binary relation
is just a set \(X \subseteq \bbN\) such that for all \(n \in X\),
there exist \(a, b \leq n\) such that \(n = (a,b)\), while a single
argument function \(f : \bbN\rightarrow \bbN\) is a binary relation on
\(\bbN\) such that for all pairs \((a,b)\) and \((c,d) \in f\), if \(a
= c\) then \(b = d\).</p>

<p>
Coding sequences of arbitrary length requires a little more
artfulness, but can be accomplished by extending the idea used above
to code pairs of numbers. This method uses Sunzi&rsquo;s theorem to
code finite sequences of numbers by single natural numbers in such a
way that any finite sequence can be recovered from its numerical code
in a computable fashion. The function \(\beta : \bbN\times \bbN\to
\bbN\) that produces, for any code for a finite sequence together with
an index, the value of the sequence at that index, is known as
<em>G&ouml;del&rsquo;s \(\beta\) function</em>. The set of all finite
sequences of natural numbers is known as \(\Seq\), and can be proved
to exist by recursive comprehension. The set of all \(s \in \Seq\)
such that \(\lh{s} = k\) is denoted by \(\bbN^k\).</p>

<p>
Once we have a coding scheme for finite sequences, we can represent
\(n\)-ary relations and functions within \(\sfRCA_0\) for arbitrary
\(n \in \bbN\). It also allows us to code finite sequences of
\(n\)-ary functions \(\str{f_1, \dotsc, f_k}\) by a single function
\(f : \bbN^n \to \bbN^k\), with \(f_i(x) = (f(x))(i)\). By combining
recursive comprehension and \(\Sigma^0_1\) induction with the coding
of finite sequences, the theory of
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#PrimRecuFuncPR">primitive recursive functions</a>
 can be developed within \(\sfRCA_0\). Finally, note that a countable
sequence of sets \(\str{X_n : n \in \bbN}\) can be coded by a single
set \(X\) by letting </p> 
\[X_i = \set{m : (i,m) \in X}.\]

<p>
Since functions, relations, real numbers and so on are coded by sets,
this technique also allows one to code countable sequences of such
objects as single sets.</p>

<h3 id="InteRatiRealNumb">3.3 Integer, rational, and real numbers</h3>

<p>
The ability to code pairs of numbers by single numbers is all that is
needed in order to code integers and rational numbers by natural
numbers. Integers are represented by pairs \((a,b) \in \bbN\times
\bbN\) where the intended interpretation of the pair \((a,b)\) is as
\(a - b\). We begin by defining the following operations of addition,
subtraction, and multiplication on \(\bbN\times \bbN,\) together with
the relations of less-than and equality.</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\begin{aligned}
    (m, n) +_\bbZ(p, q) &amp; = (m + p, n + q), \\
    (m, n) -_\bbZ(p, q) &amp; = (m + q, n + p), \\
    (m, n) \cdot_\bbZ(p, q)
                       &amp; = (m \cdot p + n \cdot q, m \cdot q + n
\cdot p), \\
    (m, n) \lt_\bbZ(p, q) &amp; \leftrightarrow m + q \lt n + p,
\\
    (m, n) =_\bbZ(p, q) &amp; \leftrightarrow m + q = n + p.
\end{aligned}\]

</div>

<p>
It is also useful to define the absolute value operation
\(|n|_\bbZ\),</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[{|(m, n)|}_\bbZ= \begin{cases}
        (m, n) &amp; \text{if \(n \leq m\)}, \\
        (n, m) &amp; \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}\]

</div>

<p>
If we take these operations alone as defining the integers, then
infinitely many different pairs will define the same integers. For
example, the integer \(-17\) is represented by the pairs \((0,17)\),
\((17,34)\), \((124,141)\), and so on. We therefore define the <em>set
of integers</em> \(\bbZ\) as consisting of the \(\lt_\bbN\)-least
members of the equivalence class induced by the relation \(=_\bbZ\).
\(\sfRCA_0\) is able to prove the existence of \(\bbZ\), and prove
that the system \((\bbZ, +_\bbZ, \cdot_\bbZ, \lt_\bbZ, =_\bbZ, 0_\bbZ,
1_\bbZ)\) is an ordered commutative ring.</p>

<p>
Rational numbers are defined in a similar way, as pairs of (codes of)
integers (and thus as pairs of pairs of natural numbers). We first
define the set of positive integers \(\bbZ^+ = \set{(m,n) : (m,n) \in
\bbZ\wedge n \lt m}\). The operations of addition, subtraction, and
multiplication of rational numbers, together with the less-than and
equality relations, can then be defined as follows:</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\begin{aligned}
    (a, b) +_\bbQ(c, d) &amp; = (a \cdot d + b \cdot c, b \cdot
d), \\
    (a, b) -_\bbQ(c, d) &amp; = (a \cdot d - b \cdot c, b \cdot
d), \\
    (a, b) \cdot_\bbQ(c, d) &amp; = (a \cdot c, b \cdot d), \\
    (a, b) \lt_\bbQ(c, d) &amp; \leftrightarrow a \cdot d \lt b
\cdot c, \\
    (a, b) =_\bbQ(c, d) &amp; \leftrightarrow a \cdot d = b \cdot
c.
\end{aligned}\]

</div>

<p>
For the sake of readability, we suppress the subscript
&ldquo;\(\bbZ\)&rdquo; on the operations and relations on the
right-hand-sides of the definitions. As with the integers, the set
\(\bbQ\) of <em>rational numbers</em> consists of the elements of
\(\bbZ\times \bbZ^+\) which are the \(\lt_\bbN\)-least members of
their equivalence class under the equivalence relation \(=_\bbQ\).
\(\sfRCA_0\) can prove the existence of \(\bbQ\) as a set, and show
that the system \((\bbQ, +_\bbQ, \cdot_\bbQ, \lt_\bbQ, =_\bbQ, 0_\bbQ,
1_\bbQ)\) is an ordered field.</p>

<p>
One way to understand the coding schemes for integer and rational
numbers just described is as defining bijective functions between
those number systems and subsets of the natural numbers. As Cantor
showed, there can be no such bijection between the irrational numbers
and the natural numbers. In order to code irrational numbers, and
hence the real numbers in general, it is therefore necessary to use
sets of natural numbers. The following approach, using fast-converging
Cauchy sequences, is the standard way to do this in reverse
mathematics. A <em>sequence of rational numbers</em> is a function \(f
: \bbN\rightarrow \bbQ\), which we will typically denote by \(\str{x_k
: k \in \bbN}\) with \(x_k = f(k)\). A <em>real number</em> is a
sequence of rational numbers \(x\) obeying the following convergence
condition: for all \(n,m \in \bbN\), \(|x_n - x_{n+m}| \leq 2^{-n}\),
where \({|(a,b)|}_\bbQ= (|a|, b)\) is the absolute value operation.
Two reals \(x\) and \(y\) are said to be <em>equal</em>, \(x =_\bbR
y\), if \(|x_n - y_n| \leq 2^{-n+1}\) for all \(n\). Note that
\(=_\bbR\) is an equivalence relation on sets of natural numbers, not
the identity relation (\ref{eq:extensionality}) on sets. We cannot
select particular sets from the equivalence classes to represent real
numbers because the base theory is too weak, and the language itself
does not allow us to quantify over the equivalence classes themselves.
Moreover, while reverse mathematicians often write things like
&ldquo;\(x \in \bbR\)&rdquo;, strictly speaking this is an abuse of
notation, because the set \(\bbR\) of all real numbers is a
third-order object which is not directly represented in second-order
arithmetic. Expressions like &ldquo;\(x \in \bbR\)&rdquo; should be
interpreted as a convenient shorthand for &ldquo;\(x\) is a real
number&rdquo;, where the property of being a real number is that
described above, i.e., the arithmetically-definable property of coding
a fast-converging Cauchy sequence of rational numbers.</p>

<p>
The rational numbers can be embedded into the reals by representing
the rational number \(q\) with the constant sequence \(r_q = \str{q_n
: n \in \bbN}\), where \(q_n = q\) for all \(n \in \bbN\). Addition,
subtraction, and multiplication of (codes for) real numbers can be
done in terms of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of
rationals. Given real numbers \(x = \str{x_n : n \in \bbN}\) and \(y =
\str{y_n : n \in \bbN}\),</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\begin{aligned}
    x +_\bbR y &amp; = \str{x_{n+1} + y_{n+1} : n \in \bbN},
\\
    x -_\bbR y &amp; = \str{x_{n+1} - y_{n+1} : n \in
\bbN},\text{ and} \\
    x \cdot_\bbR y &amp; = \str{x_{n+k} \cdot y_{n+k} : n \in
\bbN}
\end{aligned}\]

</div>

<p>
for the least \(k\) such that \(|x_0| + |y_0| + 2 \leq 2^k\). Finally,
we define the ordering \(\leq_\bbR\) by saying that \(x \leq_\bbR y\)
if and only if for all \(k \in \bbN\), \(x_k \leq y_k + 2^{-k+1}\);
\(x \lt_\bbR y\) if \(x \leq_\bbR y\) and \(x \neq_\bbR y\). As
before, to aid readability we suppress the &ldquo;\(\bbQ\)&rdquo;
subscripts on the operations and relations in the definitions above,
since it is clear from context when addition, subtraction,
multiplication etc. are operations on rational numbers rather than
integers or natural numbers. \(\sfRCA_0\) suffices to show that the
system \((\bbR, +_\bbR, \cdot_\bbR, 0_\bbR, 1_\bbR, \lt_\bbR,
=_\bbR)\) thus defined satisfies the axioms of an Archimedean ordered
field, although given the cardinality restrictions, the system itself
is not an object of the theory.</p>

<p>
Countable sequences of real numbers can also be coded as sets of
natural numbers. This is a very powerful device that allows the
formalization of statements from real analysis like the
Heine&ndash;Borel and Bolzano&ndash;Weierstra&szlig; theorems. A
<em>sequence of real numbers</em> is a function \(f : \bbN\times
\bbN\to \bbQ\) such that for each \(n \in \bbN\), the function \((f)_n
: \bbN\to \bbQ\), where \((f)_n(k) = f(k,n)\), is a real number. As
with sequences of rational numbers, we will often talk about sequences
of real numbers using notation like \(\str{x_n : n \in \bbN}\), where
\(x_n = (f)_n\). A sequence of reals \(\str{x_n : n \in \bbN}\) is
said to <em>converge</em> to a limit \(x\), \(x = \lim_n x_n\), if for
all \(\varepsilon \gt 0\) there exists an \(n\) such that for all
\(i\), \(|x - x_{n+i}| \lt \varepsilon\). Sequences where the limit
\(\lim_n x_n\) exists are described as <em>convergent</em>.</p>

<p>
These notions can be used to formulate sequential versions of standard
theorems from analysis. For example, the <em>sequential least upper
bound axiom</em> states that every bounded sequence of real numbers
has a least upper bound. This principle is not provable in
\(\sfRCA_0\), and in fact is equivalent to \(\ACA_0\). However, a
weaker principle called nested interval completeness is provable in
\(\sfRCA_0\), and can be used to prove a number of fundamental results
including the intermediate value theorem, a version of Cantor&rsquo;s
theorem that the real numbers are uncountable, and a version of the
Baire category theorem (Simpson 2009: 76&ndash;77).</p>

<h3 id="OmegModeComp">3.4 \(\omega\)-models and computability</h3>

<p>
The recursive comprehension axiom scheme gets its name from the fact
that the \(\Delta^0_1\)-definable sets of natural numbers are
precisely the
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#AritHier">recursive</a>
 (that is, computable) sets of natural numbers. As such, the set</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\REC= \set{X \subseteq \omega :
\text{\(X\) is computable}}\]

</div>

<p>
has a special role, as the second-order part of the \(\omega\)-model
\(\calR\) of \(\sfRCA_0\) introduced in
 <a href="#SemaForSecoOrdeArit">&sect;2.2</a>.
 This is one of a special class of \(\calL_2\)-structures known as
<em>\(\omega\)-models</em> in which the first-order domain is always
the standard natural numbers \(\omega\), and the \(+\), \(\times\),
and \(\lt\) symbols are interpreted by the standard (computable)
operations of addition and multiplication and the standard less-than
relation. Since the first-order part is fixed, the only part of these
structures that can vary is the range of the second-order quantifiers.
The \(\omega\)-models of differents subsystems of second-order
arithmetic often have interesting computability-theoretic properties
which are bound up with the set existence axioms that differentiate
them. Since their first-order part is standard, all \(\omega\)-models
satisfy the full induction scheme (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}).</p>

<p>
The \(\omega\)-models of \(\sfRCA_0\) are exactly the <em>Turing
ideals</em>: subsets of \(\powset{\omega}\) which are closed under
recursive joins and
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#ReduDegr">relative Turing computability</a>.
 The smallest Turing ideal is \(\REC\), and as such, \(\REC\) is also
the minimum \(\omega\)-model of \(\sfRCA_0\). We can think of \(\REC\)
as, in some sense, the intended model of \(\sfRCA_0\): the axioms of
\(\sfRCA_0\) only assert the existence of computable sets (or more
precisely, the existence of sets which are computable in some
parameter), and in \(\REC\) all sets are computable. The existence of
a minimum \(\omega\)-model of the system is a property that
\(\sfRCA_0\) shares with other subsystems of second-order arithmetic
whose characteristic axioms are comprehension schemes. The minimum
\(\omega\)-model of \(\ACA_0\) is the class \(\ARITH\) of
arithmetically definable sets, while the minimum \(\omega\)-model of
\(\Delta^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) is the class \(\HYP\) of hyperarithmetical
sets. \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) does not have a minimum
\(\omega\)-model, but it does have a minimum \(\beta\)-model, where
\(\beta\)-models are \(\omega\)-models that satisfy the additional
condition of satisfying all true \(\Sigma^1_1\) sentences, not just
all true arithmetical sentences as \(\omega\)-models do.</p>

<p>
If a statement \(\varphi\) in the language of second-order arithmetic
holds in the \(\omega\)-model whose second-order part is \(\REC\),
then we say that \(\varphi\) is <em>computably true</em>, since it is
valid when its set quantifiers are restricted so that they only range
over computable sets (and thus over computable codes for other
mathematical objects which we might think of as being computable).
Since all of the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\) are true in \(\REC\),
\(\sfRCA_0\) is computably true, and can be thought of as a natural
axiomatic system in which to formalize computable analysis, or
computable mathematics more generally. In this respect \(\sfRCA_0\) is
substantially different from most other subsystems of second-order
arithmetic which are studied in reverse mathematics. The
characteristic axioms of systems like \(\WKL_0\), \(\ACA_0\),
\(\ATR_0\) and \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) can be understood in
computability-theoretic terms as asserting the existence of certain
classes of non-computable sets, and their \(\omega\)-models are
therefore guaranteed to contain non-computable sets of different
degrees of complexity, measured in terms of hierarchies such as the
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#AritAnalHier">arithmetical or analytical hierarchies</a>,
 or in terms of the
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#TuriDegr">Turing degrees</a>.
 In this sense reverse mathematics can be thought of as measuring the
degree of non-constructivity of classical mathematical theorems.</p>

<h2 id="BigFive">4. The Big Five</h2>

<h3 id="WeakKnigLemm">4.1 Weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma</h3>

<p>
When we leave the base theory \(\sfRCA_0\) and climb up the reverse
mathematical hierarchy, the first major milestone we reach is the
system \(\WKL_0\). This system is obtained by adding to the axioms of
\(\sfRCA_0\) the nonconstructive set existence axiom <em>weak
K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma</em>, or WKL. The K&ouml;nig infinity lemma,
due to D&eacute;nes K&ouml;nig (1927), states that every finitely
branching infinite tree has an infinite path through it. WKL is
obtained by restricting K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s infinity lemma to countable
trees of binary sequences. To state it in more precise terms, we first
need to give a more formal presentation of trees.</p>

<p>
Let \(X \subseteq \bbN\) be a set of natural numbers. We denote the
set of all finite sequences of elements of \(X\) by \(X^{\lt\bbN}\).
Two important special cases are when \(X = 2 = \set{0,1}\), and
\(2^{\lt\bbN}\) is thus the set of all finite binary sequences, and
when \(X = \bbN\), and \(\bbN^{\lt\bbN} = \Seq\), the set of all
finite sequences of natural numbers. A <em>tree \(T\) on \(X\)</em> is
a set of finite sequences of elements of \(X\) which is closed under
predecessors, so if \(\tau \in T \subseteq X^{\lt\bbN}\), then
\(\tau\restr{n} \in T\) for every \(n \lt \lh{\tau}\). A tree \(T\) on
\(X\) is <em>finitely branching</em> if for every \(\tau \in T\),
there are only finitely many \(x \in X\) such that \(\tau \concat
\str{x} \in T\). A <em>path through \(T\)</em> is a function \(f :
\bbN\rightarrow X\) such that for all \(n \in \bbN\), the initial
sequence \(f\restr{n} = \str{f(0), f(1), \dotsc, f(n - 1)} \in T\). A
tree \(T\) is <em>infinite</em> if it has infinitely many nodes, i.e.,
for all \(n \in \bbN\) there exists \(\tau \in T\) such that \(\tau
\gt n\) (where \(\tau\) is considered simply as a number, rather than
as a sequence). Weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma (WKL) is the principle
that for every tree \(T \subseteq 2^{\lt\bbN}\), if \(T\) is infinite
then it has a path. \(\WKL_0\) is the system obtained by adding WKL to
the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\).</p>

<p>
Weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma is equivalent over \(\sfRCA_0\) to a
very large number of theorems, particularly in real and functional
analysis, but also in logic and algebra. It is perhaps best understood
as a compactness principle, which can be seen by looking at weak
K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma itself, but also at the theorems it is
equivalent to, such as the Heine&ndash;Borel covering theorem and the
compactness theorem for first-order logic. Other notable theorems that
are equivalent to WKL include G&ouml;del&rsquo;s completeness theorem
for first-order logic; the separable Hahn&ndash;Banach theorem;
Brouwer&rsquo;s fixed point theorem; the theorem that every countable
commutative ring has a prime ideal; and Peano&rsquo;s existence
theorem for ordinary differential equations.</p>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, adding weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma to
\(\sfRCA_0\) does not result in any increase in first-order strength.
To explain this fact, we first need to introduce the notion of
<em>conservativity</em>. Informally, this is the idea that while a
theory \(S\) may have more expressive resources than a theory \(T\)
does (for example, \(S\) may have a more extensive vocabulary), in the
part of the language that the two theories have in common, \(S\) says
no more than \(T\) does. Formally, let \(S\) and \(T\) be theories in
languages \(\calL_S\) and \(\calL_T\) respectively, and let \(\Gamma\)
be a set of sentences in the language \(\calL_S \cap \calL_T\). \(S\)
is <em>\(\Gamma\)-conservative</em> over \(T\) if for every \(\varphi
\in \Gamma\), \(S \vdash \varphi\) iff \(T \vdash \varphi\). Where the
language of \(S\) is an extension of the language of \(T\), \(\calL_T
\subseteq \calL_S\), we simply say that \(S\) is <em>conservative</em>
over \(T\). A common case is when \(S\) is a subsystem of second-order
arithmetic and \(T\) is a system of first-order arithmetic. In such
cases, if \(S\) is conservative over \(T\) then we say that the
<em>first-order part</em> of \(S\) is \(T\).</p>

<p>
Three key conservativity theorems connect \(\sfRCA_0\) and \(\WKL_0\),
and explain their first-order strength. The first is that
\(\rmI\Sigma_1\) is \(\Pi^0_2\)-conservative over \(\PRA\), where
\(\rmI\Sigma_1\) is a subsystem of first-order Peano arithmetic
\(\PA\) obtained by restricting the induction scheme to \(\Sigma_1\)
formulas, and \(\PRA\) is the system of primitive recursive arithmetic
developed by Skolem (1923) and axiomatized by Hilbert &amp; Bernays
(1934). This result was proved by Parsons (1970) and is hence known as
<em>Parsons&rsquo;s theorem</em> (Joosten 2002
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Reseources</a>];
 Ferreira 2005). The second is that \(\rmI\Sigma_1\) is the
first-order part of \(\sfRCA_0\). This is due to Friedman (1976);
proofs can be found in Simpson (2009: IX.1) and Hirschfeldt (2014:
129). The third is that \(\WKL_0\) is \(\Pi^1_1\)-conservative over
\(\sfRCA_0\). This is an unpublished theorem of Harrington. Its proof
was made generally available by Simpson (2009: IX.2), and a somewhat
more detailed version can be found in Hirschfeldt (2014: 7.2).</p>

<p>
Combining the first two results, we have that \(\sfRCA_0\) is
\(\Pi^0_2\)-conservative over \(\PRA\). This has important
ramifications for our understanding of finitism in the sense of
Hilbert and Bernays, and the relationship of that program to the
formal system \(\sfRCA_0\)
 (<a href="#FiniSfRC">&sect;5.2</a>).
 With the addition of Harrington&rsquo;s theorem we can see that that
the first-order part of \(\WKL_0\) is \(\rmI\Sigma_1\), and that
\(\WKL_0\) is \(\Pi^0_2\)-conservative over \(\PRA\). Since
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/#SecIncThe">consistency statements</a>
 are \(\Pi^0_1\) sentences, it follows that \(\WKL_0\) is
equiconsistent with \(\sfRCA_0\), \(\rmI\Sigma_1\), and \(\PRA\),
since one can prove in \(\PRA\) that the consistency of any of these
theories implies the consistency of the others. By the same token,
\(\WKL_0\) has the same
 <a href="../proof-theory/#OrdiProoTheo">proof-theoretic ordinal</a>
 as \(\sfRCA_0\), \(\rmI\Sigma_1\), and \(\PRA\), namely
\(\omega^\omega\).</p>

<p>
Harrington&rsquo;s proof is model-theoretic in character: it uses a
forcing argument to show that every countable model of \(\sfRCA_0\)
can be expanded to a countable model of \(\WKL_0\) while preserving
the truth values of \(\Pi^1_1\) formulas. Sieg (1985) subsequently
gave the theorem a more constructive treatment by constructing a
primitive recursive function \(f\) which transforms any proof \(p\) in
\(\WKL_0\) of a a \(\Pi^0_2\) statement \(\varphi\) into a proof
\(f(p)\) of \(\varphi\) in \(\PRA\). Although somewhat technical,
these conservativity results inspired a debate in the foundations of
mathematics concerning the limits of the mathematics that could be
recovered in a formal system which was finitist in the sense of
Hilbert&rsquo;s program
 (<a href="#FiniReduWKL0">&sect;5.3</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="AritComp">4.2 Arithmetical comprehension</h3>

<p>
The third member of the Big Five is \(\ACA_0\), where ACA stands for
&ldquo;arithmetical comprehension axiom&rdquo;. A formula \(\varphi\)
in the language of second-order arithmetic is <em>arithmetical</em> if
it contains no set quantifiers, although it may contain free set
variables. The <em>arithmetical comprehension scheme</em> consists of
the universal closures of all formulas of the form</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\exists{X}\forall{n}(n \in X
\leftrightarrow \varphi(n))\]

</div>

<p>
where \(\varphi\) is arithmetical with \(X\) not free, although
\(\varphi\) may contain other free set and number variables.
\(\ACA_0\) is the system obtained by adding the arithmetical
comprehension scheme to the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\). \(\ACA_0\) proves
the <em>arithmetical induction scheme</em>, that is, the restriction
of the induction scheme (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}) to arithmetical
formulas. This means that \(\ACA_0\) proves all of the axioms of
first-order Peano arithmetic \(\PA\). Via a conservativity result due
to Friedman (1976), a kind of converse of this result also holds:
every sentence in the language of first-order arithmetic which is
provable in \(\ACA_0\) is also provable in \(\PA\). It follows from
this result that
 <a href="../proof-theory/#GentConsProo">Gentzen&rsquo;s consistency proof</a>
 for \(\PA\) also applies to \(\ACA_0\), and that \(\ACA_0\) has the
same proof-theoretic ordinal as \(\PA\), namely \(\varepsilon_0\).</p>

<p>
\(\ACA_0\) is strictly stronger than both \(\sfRCA_0\) and \(\WKL_0\).
Where the former is concerned, this can be easily seen from the fact
that arithmetical comprehension is computably false, since it proves
that the halting problem \(K\) and many other non-computable sets
exist, so the \(\omega\)-model \(\REC\) provides a counterexample: a
model in which \(\sfRCA_0\) is true but arithmetical comprehension is
false. Proving that \(\WKL_0\) is strictly weaker than \(\ACA_0\)
requires a more subtle computability-theoretic argument, using the low
basis theorem of Jockusch &amp; Soare (1972) to prove the existence of
a model of \(\WKL_0\) which does not contain \(K\), and therefore does
not satisfy arithmetical comprehension.</p>

<p>
Although many important analytical theorems can be proved in
\(\WKL_0\), some fundamental results about the nature of the real
numbers can only be proved with the use of arithmetical comprehension.
Many of these results concern the sequential completeness and
compactness of the real line, and assert the existence of limits of
various kinds of sequences. The most basic of these is a sequential
form of the least upper bound axiom, which states that every bounded
sequence of real numbers has a least upper bound. Others are the
Bolzano&ndash;Weierstra&szlig; theorem, which states that every
bounded sequence of real numbers contains a subsequence which
converges to a limit; the monotone convergence theorem, which states
that every monotone sequence of real numbers converges to a limit; and
the Cauchy convergence theorem, which states that every Cauchy
sequence of real numbers converges to a limit. All of these theorems
are provable in \(\ACA_0\), and when added to the base theory
\(\sfRCA_0\), each of them imply arithmetical comprehension. This
collection of equivalences, due to Friedman (1975), can be seen of as
a formalization of the informal equivalences proved in the last
chapter of Dedekind (1872), but for the sequential notion of
completeness of the real number line, rather than Dedekind&rsquo;s
notion of completeness for arbitrary bounded sets of real numbers.</p>

<p>
Although these statements are only concerned with the real number line
\(\bbR\), they can easily be extended to the Euclidean plane
\(\bbR^2\), the three-dimensional Euclidean space \(\bbR^3\), or any
finite-dimensional Euclidean space \(\bbR^n\). The corresponding
sequential completeness theorems for those spaces are also provable in
\(\ACA_0\), and thus equivalent to it over \(\sfRCA_0\), since they
imply the versions for \(\bbR\). More generally still, it is possible
to represent the notion of a complete separable metric space within
second-order arithmetic, and thus state versions of these theorems
which hold for any such space. These theorems too are provable in
\(\ACA_0\), as are stronger generalizations such as the Ascoli lemma.
\(\ACA_0\) is also strong enough to prove that, in any complete
separable metric space which is also compact, every sequence of points
has a convergent subsequence.</p>

<p>
Although analysis is rich in theorems equivalent to arithmetical
comprehension, other areas may be even more so, especially algebra.
These theorems concern a wide variety of algebraic structures
including countable abelian groups, countable fields (including
ordered and formally real fields), countable commutative rings, and
countable vector spaces. Some important examples include the theorem
that every countable field has a strong algebraic closure, and that
every countable field has a strong real closure; that every countable
commutative ring has a maximal ideal; that every countable abelian
group has a unique divisible closure; and that every countable vector
space over a countable field has a basis.</p>

<p>
Countable infinitary combinatorics also provides several important
equivalences to arithmetical comprehension. One is K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s
lemma that every infinite, finitely branching tree contains an
infinite path. This is an interesting case in which the precise
statement of the theorem matters a great deal. The restriction of
K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma to trees in which the number of branchings
from any given node is bounded (bounded K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma) is
strictly weaker than arithmetical comprehension, and in fact it is
equivalent to weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma. The unrestricted version
of K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma, on the other hand, is equivalent to
arithmetical comprehension.</p>

<p>
Another example is Ramsey&rsquo;s theorem. Given fixed natural numbers
\(n \geq 1\) and \(k \geq 1\), the statement \(\RT^n_k\) asserts that
every for every \(k\)-colouring of \(n\)-tuples of natural numbers,
there exists an infinite monochromatic or <em>homogeneous</em> subset
of those tuples. When \(n \geq 3\) and \(k \geq 2\), \(\RT^n_k\)
implies arithmetical comprehension over \(\sfRCA_0\). The statement
\(\RT^2_2\), however, holds a special place in reverse mathematics, as
it lies outside the Big Five classification: it is not provable in
\(\sfRCA_0\) (Specker 1971), not provable in \(\WKL_0\) (Jockusch
1972), does not imply arithmetical comprehension (Seetapun &amp;
Slaman 1995), and does not imply weak K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s lemma either
(Liu 2012). Discussing these results, their implications, and more
recent work on Ramsey&rsquo;s theorem and the Reverse Mathematics Zoo
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>]
 which arose from its study would take us too far afield, but there
are now many good introductory references including Hirschfeldt (2014)
and Dzhafarov &amp; Mummert (2022: Chapter 8).</p>

<h3 id="AritTranRecu">4.3 Arithmetical transfinite recursion</h3>

<p>
Arithmetical comprehension allows us to construct objects by applying
some arithmetically-definable operation a finite number of times. A
natural generalization of this method of proof is to allow such
iterations to continue all the way to the first infinite ordinal
\(\omega\), and off into the transfinite. Constructing mathematical
objects by transfinite recursion is of course a standard part of set
theory, licensed by the axiom scheme of replacement. The axiom scheme
of <em>arithmetical transfinite recursion</em> is an arithmetical
analogue, in which the operator \(\Phi(X)\) which one can apply must
be arithmetically definable, and in which the well-orderings along
which the operator can be iterated must be countable. Despite these
restrictions, arithmetical transfinite recursion is quite powerful.
Adding it to \(\sfRCA_0\) produces the system \(\ATR_0\), a much
stronger system than \(\ACA_0\) which can prove not merely theorems of
classical analysis, but many results in descriptive set theory
concerning Borel and analytic sets.</p>

<p>
In order to define arithmetical transfinite recursion, we must first
understand what is meant in this setting by a well-ordering. A binary
relation \(R \subseteq \bbN\times \bbN\) is said to be
<em>reflexive</em> if for all \(x,y \in \bbN\), if \((x,y) \in R\)
then \((x,x) \in R\) and \((y,y) \in R\). If \(R\) is a reflexive
relation then we define \(\mathrm{field}(R) = \set{x : (x,x) \in R}\).
We also write \(x \leq_R y\) if and only if \((x,y) \in R\), and \(x
\lt_R y\) if and only if \((x, y) \in R\) and \((y, x) \not\in R\). A
<em>countable linear ordering</em> is a reflexive relation which is
also transitive (if \(x \leq_R y\) and \(y \leq_R z\), then \(x \leq_R
z\)), antisymmetric (if \(x \leq_R y\) and \(y \leq_R x\), then \(x =
y\)), and total (if \(x,y \in \mathrm{field}(R)\), then \(x \leq_R y\)
or \(y \leq_R x\)). We write \(\mathrm{LO}(R)\) as an abbreviation for
the formula asserting that \(R\) is a countable linear ordering. If
\(R\) is a reflexive relation, \(R\) is <em>well-founded</em> if it
contains no infinite descending chain: for all \(f : \bbN\to
\mathrm{field}(R)\) there exists \(n \in \bbN\) such that \(f(n+1)
\not\lt_R f(n)\). We write \(\mathrm{WF}(R)\) as an abbreviation for
the formula asserting that \(R\) is well-founded. A <em>countable
well-ordering</em> is a countable linear order \(R\) which is also
well-founded. We write \(\mathrm{WO}(R)\) as an abbreviation for the
formula asserting that \(R\) is a countable well-ordering, i.e., that
\(\mathrm{LO}(R) \wedge \mathrm{WF}(R)\).</p>

<p>
The next step in defining arithmetical transfinite recursion is the
notion of a <em>hierarchy</em>: a system of sets built up from some
initial set by the repeated application of an operator. Given a
formula \(\varphi(n,Y)\), let \(\mathrm{H}_\varphi(X,Y)\) be the
formula asserting that \(X\) is a countable linear ordering and that
\(Y\) is the set of all pairs \((n,j)\) such that \(j \in
\mathrm{field}(X)\) and \(\varphi(n, Y^j)\), where </p> 
\[Y^j = \set{(m,i) : i \lt_X j \wedge (m,i) \in Y}.\]

<p>
The idea behind this definition is that \(Y\) is the hierarchy of sets
that result from iterating the operator defined by the formula
\(\varphi\) along the ordering \(X\), and that \(Y^j\) is the set
constructed at level \(j\) of the iteration. The <em>axiom scheme of
arithmetical transfinite recursion</em> consists of the universal
closures of all instances of the scheme</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\label{eq:atr}
    \tag{ATR}
    \forall{X}(\mathrm{WO}(X) \rightarrow
\exists{Y}\mathrm{H}_\varphi(X,Y))\]

</div>

<p>
where \(\varphi(n,Y)\) is arithmetical. The system \(\ATR_0\) consists
of the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\) plus all instances of the axiom scheme
of arithmetical transfinite recursion.</p>

<p>
Given the nature of the axiom it is unsurprising that theorems
equivalent to ATR all have some explicit or implicit connection to
countable well-orderings. One of the most fundamental, partly due to
its role in the proofs of many reversals, is the seemingly innocuous
statement CWO that any two countable well-orderings are comparable:
one must always be isomorphic to an initial segment of the other.
Ordinals have been bound up with the theory of point-sets (in the most
basic case, sets of real numbers) since the inception of both in the
work of Cantor in the early 1880s (Ferreir&oacute;s 2007: Chapter VI).
Cantor used countable ordinals in his proof of the
Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem that every closed set is the union of a
perfect set and a countable set. This theorem is actually equivalent
to \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension
 (<a href="#Pi11Comp">&sect;4.4</a>),
 but other theorems from descriptive set theory only require
arithmetical transfinite recursion. One such result is the perfect set
theorem that every closed set contains a perfect subset. Another is
Luzin&rsquo;s separation theorem that any two disjoint analytic sets
can be separated by a perfect set. This theorem is standardly used in
descriptive set theory to prove Suslin&rsquo;s theorem that the Borel
sets are exactly those analytic sets whose complement is also analytic
(Kechris 1995: 14). Suslin&rsquo;s theorem can therefore also be
proved in \(\ATR_0\), although it is not equivalent to it.</p>

<h3 id="Pi11Comp">4.4 \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension</h3>

<p>
The last of the Big Five systems is \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\), whose
characteristic axiom is the \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension scheme. A
formula \(\varphi\) in the language of second-order arithmetic is
\(\Pi^1_1\) if it has the form \(\forall{X}\theta\), where \(X\) is a
set variable and \(\theta\) is an arithmetical formula. A formula
\(\varphi\) is \(\Sigma^1_1\) if it has the form \(\exists{X}\theta\),
with \(\theta\) arithmetical and \(X\) a set variable. Every
\(\Pi^1_1\) formula is equivalent to the negation of a \(\Sigma^1_1\)
formula, and every \(\Sigma^1_1\) formula is equivalent to the
negation of a \(\Pi^1_1\) formula. The \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension
scheme consists of the universal closures of all formulas of the
form</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\exists{X}\forall{n}(n \in X
\leftrightarrow \varphi(n))\]

</div>

<p>
where \(\varphi\) is \(\Pi^1_1\) with \(X\) not free, although
\(\varphi\) may contain other free set and number variables. The
axioms of \(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) are the axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\) plus
all instances of the \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension scheme. While one can
also define a corresponding \(\Sigma^1_1\) comprehension scheme, this
turns out to be unnecessary, since every instance of \(\Sigma^1_1\)
comprehension is provably equivalent in \(\sfRCA_0\) to an instance of
\(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension.</p>

<p>
\(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension is needed in order to extend the results on
perfect sets provable in \(\ATR_0\)
 (<a href="#AritTranRecu">&sect;4.3</a>).
 The historically most notable such result is the
Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem, which states that every closed set is
the union of a perfect set and a countable set. Kreisel (1959) proved
the existence of computable closed sets of the form \(F = F_p \cup
F_c\) such that \(F_p\) is perfect and \(F_c\) is countable, but the
(codes of) \(F_p\) and \(F_c\) are \(\Pi^1_1\) but not \(\Delta^1_1\).
This shows that \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension is required in order to
prove the Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem, and in fact the
Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem is provably equivalent over \(\ACA_0\)
to \(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension (Simpson 2009: theorem VI.1.6, pp.
219&ndash;220).</p>

<p>
Other important results in descriptive set theory equivalent to
\(\Pi^1_1\) comprehension include the Kond&ocirc;&ndash;Addison
theorem that every coanalytic relation can be uniformized by a
coanalytic function, Silver&rsquo;s theorem that every coanalytic
equivalence relation contains either countably many or
\(2^{\aleph_0}\)-many equivalence classes, and the determinacy of
games with a \(\Sigma^0_1 \wedge \Pi^0_1\) payoff set.
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA\) is also needed for a number of results in group
theory, involving the order types of countable ordered groups and the
structure theory of countable abelian groups. Solomon (2001) showed
that Mal&rsquo;tsev&rsquo;s theorem is equivalent over \(\sfRCA_0\) to
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA\), while Friedman, Simpson, and Smith (1983)
showed the same for the statement that every countable abelian group
is the direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group.</p>

<p>
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) is the strongest system standardly studied in
reverse mathematics, although reversals to stronger systems have been
found. One such example is the equivalence between \(\Pi^1_2\)
comprehension and a statement from general topology concerning
countably based spaces of maximal filters (Mummert &amp; Simpson
2005). Other statements, for example determinacy axioms, are even
stronger (Montalb&aacute;n &amp; Shore 2012). Nevertheless, for most
mathematical statements studied in reverse mathematics, even
\(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) is a much stronger system than is required in
order to prove them.</p>

<h2 id="FounProgReveMath">5. Foundational Programs and Reverse Mathematics</h2>

<h3 id="CompMathConsMathSfRC">5.1 Computable mathematics, constructive mathematics, and \(\sfRCA_0\)</h3>

<p>
Mathematics in \(\sfRCA_0\) shares much with that in a number of
broadly constructive approaches to mathematics, most notably
constructive analysis in the tradition of Bishop, Russian constructive
mathematics, and computable analysis (also known in older texts as
recursive analysis). However, there are also important differences,
largely centred on the use of the
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/#RejTerNonDat">law of excluded middle</a>
 (LEM) which, as a theory formulated in classical logic, \(\sfRCA_0\)
satisfies.</p>

<p>
At the centre of the connection between the formal system \(\sfRCA_0\)
and traditions in constructive mathematics is Church&rsquo;s thesis.
In the context of constructive mathematics, this states that every
constructive function is extensionally equivalent to a recursive
function, i.e., there exists a Turing machine which halts on every
input and produces the same output as the constructive function. Using
Kleene&rsquo;s <i>T</i> predicate and <i>U</i> function we can
formalize this as</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\tag{CT}
    \label{eq:CT}
    \forall{f}\exists{e}\forall{n}\exists{p}(
        T(e,n,p) \wedge U(p) = f(n)
    ).\]

</div>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#RecuCounReveMath">&sect;1.3</a>,
 the interpretation of the notion of a construction in terms of
computable functions dates back to the early history of computability
theory in the 1940s. Since \ref{eq:CT} can be read as a formal
statement in the language of second-order arithmetic, we can consider
its status in relation to classical subsystems of second-order
arithmetic. \ref{eq:CT} is consistent with \(\sfRCA_0\), since the
axioms of \(\sfRCA_0\) are satisfied in the \(\omega\)-model \(\REC\)
consisting of all and only the computable sets
 (<a href="#OmegModeComp">&sect;3.4</a>).
 However, it is inconsistent with stronger systems that imply the
existence of non-computable sets.</p>

<p>
Russian constructive mathematics, working in the tradition of Markov,
embraced the idea that constructive procedures were algorithmic ones,
and thus built a version of Church&rsquo;s thesis into their approach
(Kushner 2006). Bishop&rsquo;s constructive analysis followed a
different path: one which rejected the law of excluded middle, but
accepted neither Brouwer&rsquo;s new basis for analysis in his
Creating Subject arguments, nor the close association with
computability theory of the Russian constructivists. As Bishop puts
it, he develops analysis &ldquo;with an absolute minimum of
philosophical prejudice concerning the nature of constructive
mathematics&rdquo; (Bishop 1967: ix), going on to assert that
&ldquo;[t]here are no dogmas to which we must conform&rdquo;.
Bishop&rsquo;s system is thus consistent with classical mathematics,
with intuitionistic mathematics, and with Church&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<p>
However, the system \(\sfRCA_0\) is not a faithful formalization of
any of these constructivist viewpoints: the classical logic it embeds
is an insurmountable barrier. The intermediate value theorem provides
a good example of why this is. While the intermediate value theorem is
provable in \(\sfRCA_0\), the proof essentially relies on a case
distinction made via the law of the excluded middle, and is thus not
constructively provable (Bridges &amp; Richman 1987: 5). This limits
our ability to use provability in \(\sfRCA_0\) as a marker of
constructive provability. Further complications are provided by the
fact that in \(\sfRCA_0\), induction is restricted to \(\Sigma^0_1\)
predicates, while constructivists tend to accept unrestricted
quantifier complexity in their uses of induction.</p>

<p>
In some ways, computable analysis as presented in works like Aberth
(1980) and Pour-El &amp; Richards (1989) provides a better match with
\(\sfRCA_0\) than constructive analysis, as Simpson (2010) suggests.
This does have a foundational upshot of sorts, since as Beeson (1985)
remarks,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is a coherent philosophy of mathematics under which recursive
mathematics represents the truth about the mathematical universe. If
one takes this view, then the subject has a significance beyond the
mere production of counterexamples. [&hellip;&#8198;][T]he world under
Church&rsquo;s thesis is an entertaining place, full of surprises
(like any foreign country), but not by any means too chaotic to
support life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thoroughgoing constructivists do not take the natural numbers to form
a completed infinite totality, while in computable analysis the
standard machinery of computability theory (which does make this
assumption) is taken as fundamental (Pour-El &amp; Richards 1989:
VII). The use of classical logic in \(\sfRCA_0\) is thus
unproblematic. Recursive comprehension, its characteristic axiom,
seems tailor-made for computable mathematics. It is thus easier to say
that provability in \(\sfRCA_0\) implies truth in computable analysis,
although the restriction on the induction principle does mean that as
far as computable mathematics is concerned, \(\sfRCA_0\) is a
needlessly restricted system. Moreover, recursive counterexamples
 (<a href="#RecuCounReveMath">&sect;1.3</a>)&mdash;and
 thus reversals to set existence principles asserting the existence of
non-computable sets&mdash;have a clear interpretation in the context
of computable mathematics, namely demonstrating that they are false.
\(\Pi^1_1\) statements should, however, be excluded from this
analysis, since any true \(\Pi^1_1\) statement will be true in the
\(\omega\)-model \(\REC\), and thus computably true, regardless of
whether or not it is provable in \(\sfRCA_0\). For further discussion
of this point, see (Eastaugh 2019: 157, 171&ndash;172).</p>

<h3 id="FiniSfRC">5.2 Finitism and \(\sfRCA_0\)</h3>

<p>
The formal system \(\sfRCA_0\) also has connections to another
important foundational program, Hilbertian finitism.
 <a href="../hilbert-program/">Hilbert&rsquo;s program</a>
 was to secure the status of
 <a href="../settheory-early/">Cantorian infinitary mathematics</a>,
 by proving its consistency using purely finitary means. This reflects
Hilbert&rsquo;s two-tier epistemology in which finitary combinatorial
statements hold a special status, since unlike the abstract elements
of ideal, infinitary mathematics, they concern &ldquo;extra-logical
discrete objects, which exist intuitively as immediate experience
before all thought&rdquo; (Hilbert 1922: 163).</p>

<p>
The <em>real</em> (finitary, contentual) propositions include, for
Hilbert, numerical equations, together with the more complex
statements that can be formed from equations via the propositional
connectives (negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication).
Moreover, the universal closures of such statements also have finitary
meaning, because we can think of them as a schema:
\(\forall{x}\varphi(x)\), where \(\varphi\) is quantifier-free, means
that for any given number \(\overline{n}\), we can verify in a
finitary way that \(\varphi(\overline{n})\). It is anachronistic but
technically helpful to refer to this class of statements as the
\(\Pi^0_1\) sentences of the language of arithmetic. In contrast to
this, <em>ideal</em> statements do not have finitary meaning: they are
merely symbolic,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
formulas that [&#8198;&hellip;] in themselves mean nothing but are
merely things that are governed by our rules and must be regarded as
the <em>ideal objects</em> of the theory. (Hilbert 1928 [1967: 470],
emphasis in original) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Hilbert, these ideal objects are necessary in order to
recover the general principles of logic, including the law of excluded
middle, since he considered the development of analysis to be
impossible without them.</p>

<p>
Hilbert thus undertook a program to vindicate ideal mathematics on a
finitary basis. Since ideal mathematics could be formalized within
logical calculi such as those developed in Whitehead and
Russell&rsquo;s
 <a href="../principia-mathematica/"><em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>,
 the aim of the Hilbert program became to prove the consistency of the
formalized mathematical theories of analysis and set theory. To this
end, Hilbert and his collaborators developed the tools of proof
theory, including the
 <a href="../epsilon-calculus/">\(\varepsilon\)-calculus</a>.
 On the conceptual side, the real propositions were intended as
analogous to experimental observations in physics, which can confirm
or refute a theory. In this analogy, ideal mathematics is like a
physical theory that gives general laws, only individual instances of
which can be verified. Ideal mathematics should thus be conservative
over real mathematics: any real proposition which can be proved via
ideal methods should also be provable in a finitary way.</p>

<p>
In light of Tait&rsquo;s (1981) analysis of finitistic reasoning as
primitive recursive reasoning, the \(\Pi^0_2\)-conservativity of
\(\sfRCA_0\) over \(\PRA\)
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>)
 takes on a philosophical dimension related to Hilbert&rsquo;s
conservativity program. Tait argues for two claims, now commonly
referred to as <em>Tait&rsquo;s theses</em>. The first is that the
finitist functions \(f : \bbN\rightarrow \bbN\) are exactly the
primitive recursive functions. The second is that the finitistically
provable \(\Pi^0_1\) (i.e., real) sentences are exactly those provable
in the formal system \(\PRA\). By the conservativity theorem stated
above, these are also exactly the \(\Pi^0_1\) sentences provable in
\(\sfRCA_0\), and moreover the computable functions which \(\sfRCA_0\)
can prove are total are precisely the primitive recursive ones.
Although \(\sfRCA_0\) is evidently in some sense an infinitary system
in which substantial mathematical reasoning about infinitary objects
can be carried out, in virtue of the conservativity theorem and its
consequences it also has some claim to being reducible to a finitary
system, and thus perhaps in some instrumental way acceptable to the
finitist. This kind of finitistic reductionism is discussed further in
 <a href="#FiniReduWKL0">&sect;5.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Tait&rsquo;s theses have been widely discussed and become broadly
accepted, although not without their share of criticism along the way.
These criticisms can be broken down into two rough types, historical
and conceptual, although these are sometimes intertwined. On the
conceptual side, there are two groups of complainants: those who
consider Tait&rsquo;s analysis too liberal, such as Ganea (2010), and
those who consider it too conservative. Kreisel (1958, 1970) is a
prominent example of the latter, arguing that finitist provability
should instead be identified with provability in \(\PA\). Central to
the disagreement between Kreisel and Tait is the status of functions
\(f : \bbN\to \bbN\) which are computable but not primitive recursive,
and thus while arguably finitary in nature, nonetheless transgress
what Tait considers the boundaries of finitism.</p>

<p>
The quintessential example of such a function is the
 <a href="../recursive-functions/#AckePeteFunc">Ackermann&ndash;P&eacute;ter function</a>.
 Discovered in 1928 by Wilhelm Ackermann, a member of the Hilbert
school whose dissertation provided the first substantive example of a
finitistic consistency proof, it was subsequently simplified by
P&eacute;ter (1935), and then further simplified by Robinson (1948).
The Ackermann&ndash;P&eacute;ter function is defined, by a
doubly-recursive definition, as</p>

<div class="linenomath">

\[\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0, x)         &amp; = x + 1, \\
    \pi(i + 1, 0)     &amp; = \pi(i, 1), \\
    \pi(i + 1, x + 1) &amp; = \pi(i, \pi(i + 1, x)).
\end{aligned}\]

</div>

<p>
Contemporary views differ as to whether the
Ackermann&ndash;P&eacute;ter function is finitary in nature, and even
on whether Hilbert considered it to be so. In the course of defending
the view that finitistic provability coincides with provability in
\(\PA\), Kreisel (1970) points to Hilbert&rsquo;s explicit discussion
of Ackermann&rsquo;s function in Hilbert 1926 as evidence that Hilbert
considered the function to be finitary in nature. Taking the opposite
position, Tait (1981) argues that Kreisel&rsquo;s view is based on a
misreading of Hilbert, and that Hilbert himself did not consider
Ackermann&rsquo;s function to be finitary <em>simpliciter</em>, but
finitary relative to a system of non-finitary types. More recently,
Zach (1998) concluded that while in the early 1920s Hilbert did not
conceive of his finitism as going beyond primitive recursion, there
are reasons to believe that the later Hilbert, and especially his
collaborator Bernays, took a different view and considered the
Ackermann&ndash;P&eacute;ter function, along with other functions
defined by means of higher-type recursions, to be finitary in nature.
For further discussions of these issues see Tait 2002; Zach 2003; and
Dean 2015.</p>

<h3 id="FiniReduWKL0">5.3 Finitistic reductionism and \(\WKL_0\)</h3>

<p>
According to the two theses advanced by Tait (1981) and which the
discussion of \(\sfRCA_0\) and finitism in
 <a href="#FiniSfRC">&sect;5.2</a>
 centred on, the finitist functions are precisely the primitive
recursive functions, while the finitist theorems are precisely the
\(\Pi^0_1\) sentences provable in \(\PRA\). Assuming that one grants
the correctness of Tait&rsquo;s theses in terms of determining the
extent and limits of finitist mathematics, and that G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
incompleteness theorems pose an insurmountable barrier to a genuine
realization of the Hilbertian dream of reducing all infinitary
mathematics to finitary mathematics, questions still remain concerning
the extent to which ideal mathematics could be recovered by a
Hilbertian reduction. Simpson (1988) proposed what he called a partial
realization of Hilbert&rsquo;s program. Simpson&rsquo;s ideas follow
those of Hilbert from the mid-1920s onwards, in which the program of
giving a finitary proof of the consistency of infinitary mathematics
was replaced by the program of demonstrating the conservativity of
infinitary mathematics over real mathematics: that is, showing that if
a finitistically-meaningful statement admits of an ideal proof, then
it is also finitistically true.</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems seem to show that this
conservativity program cannot succeed, at least if we accept that all
finitary reasoning can be formalized within a fixed axiomatic system
<i>T</i> such as \(\PRA\). Wherever we draw the line between finitary
and infinitary mathematics, finitary mathematics cannot prove its own
consistency, let alone that of infinitary mathematics. Simpson accepts
this piece of received wisdom about the impact of the incompleteness
theorems on Hilbert&rsquo;s program, but argues that we can
nonetheless achieve a partial realization of Hilbert&rsquo;s program.
The program of finitistic reductionism which Simpson proposes leans on
the \(\Pi^0_2\)-conservativity of \(\WKL_0\) over \(\PRA\)
 (<a href="#WeakKnigLemm">&sect;4.1</a>).
 The idea is that any finitistically meaningful (i.e., \(\Pi^0_1\))
sentence \(\varphi\) that can be proved in the ideal, infinitary
system \(\WKL_0\) is also provable in \(\PRA\), and thus by
Tait&rsquo;s thesis is finitistically provable.</p>

<p>
The mathematics that can be developed in \(\WKL_0\) is extensive, and
prima facie this lends a good deal of substance to Simpson&rsquo;s
position. However, the view has attracted its share of criticism. Note
first that one might reject the conservativity constraint altogether,
as Detlefsen (1990) does. We shall pass over criticisms of this kind
since addressing them would take us too far afield. The second type of
criticism, typified by Sieg (1990), takes Simpson to task for being
insufficiently faithful to the historical Hilbert program. Giving this
claim the attention it deserves would, similar to the first type of
objection, require a more detailed study than this entry is able to,
but readers are directed to the entry on
 <a href="../hilbert-program/">Hilbert&rsquo;s program</a>
 for starting points from which to investigate this issue. Critics of
the third type point out that despite the strength of \(\WKL_0\),
substantial parts of mathematics&mdash;even if we restrict ourselves
to so-called &ldquo;ordinary mathematics&rdquo;&mdash;require stronger
axioms, as the results in
 <a href="#AritComp">&sect;4.2</a>&ndash;<a href="#Pi11Comp">&sect;4.4</a>
 attest. This is, of course, a fair criticism of the extent of the
mathematics that can be recovered within Simpson&rsquo;s finitistic
reductionism, but it is also in some sense misplaced, since as Simpson
emphasizes, his program is only intended as a partial realization of
Hilbert&rsquo;s, not a complete one. Moreover, as Simpson points out,
finitistic reductionism is not limited to \(\WKL_0\), since there are
strict extensions of \(\WKL_0\) that are still
\(\Pi^0_2\)-conservative over \(\PRA\), including the system
\(\WKL^+_0\) introduced by Brown &amp; Simpson (1993), and even
\(\WKL_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2\) (Patey &amp; Yokoyama 2018).</p>

<p>
A more incisive and subtle line of argument stems from the status of
the conservativity theorem itself. The mere fact that \(\WKL_0\) is
\(\Pi^0_2\)- conservative over \(\PRA\) is not sufficient to establish
a genuinely finitistic reduction, since in order to appeal to it, the
conservativity result must be provable from the finitary standpoint.
This objection can be partially rebutted by appealing to Sieg&rsquo;s
(1985) theorem that there exists a primitive recursive proof
transformation that will transform any \(\WKL_0\) proof of a
\(\Pi^0_2\) sentence into a \(\PRA\) proof of that same sentence. If
we accept Tait&rsquo;s theses, then the proof transformation is a
finitary procedure for producing finitary proofs from infinitary ones,
just as Hilbert (1928) anticipated.</p>

<p>
However, the initial objection can be spelled out in a more damaging
way, drawing on a point already made by Tait (1981), namely that his
theses provide an external analysis of finitism rather than an
internal one which is accessible from the finitary standpoint. This
being the case, the finitist is not in a position to evaluate
Tait&rsquo;s theses, since their very characterizations involve
infinitary notions such as that of an arbitrary function \(f : \bbN\to
\bbN\) which the finitist neither understands nor accepts. Burgess
(2010) argues that because of this, the finitist cannot understand
Sieg&rsquo;s conservativity proof as giving a method of transforming
proofs in a formal system for ideal mathematics, \(\WKL_0\), into
proofs in a contentual finitary system. Instead, they can only
understand it as a mechanism for transforming proofs in one formal
system into proofs in another. They can then laboriously verify that
each \(\PRA\) proof obtained by applying the proof transformation is
indeed a finitary proof. However, they cannot accept the general claim
that all such proofs are finitary proofs, since this would amount to
accepting the reflection principle for \(\PRA\), which implies the
consistency of \(\PRA\)&mdash;a statement which, by Tait&rsquo;s
second thesis and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s second incompleteness theorem, is
not finitistically provable (Giaquinto 1983; Dean 2015).</p>

<h3 id="AritDefiPred">5.4 Arithmetical definability and predicativity</h3>

<p>
Arithmetical definability has been linked to predicative approaches to
the foundations of mathematics since
 <a href="../weyl/">Hermann Weyl</a>&rsquo;s
 monograph <em>Das Kontinuum</em> (Weyl 1918). Weyl argued that the
contemporary set-theoretic construction of the real numbers and the
associated theory of analysis was a &ldquo;house [&#8198;&hellip;] to
a large degree built on sand&rdquo; (Weyl 1994: 1). The task he set
for himself was to develop a theory of analysis based on which did not
fall foul of
 <a href="../russell-paradox/">Russell&rsquo;s paradox</a>,
 and which embodied a mathematically more natural approach than
 <a href="../type-theory/#ParaRussTypeTheo">Russell&rsquo;s theory of types</a>.
 As Weyl himself noted, the ideas of <em>Das Kontinuum</em> have much
in common with the approaches of Russell and Poincar&eacute;. They
agree in their rejection of impredicative comprehension, and
Weyl&rsquo;s system of levels corresponds to Russell&rsquo;s theory of
types (Russell 1908; Whitehead &amp; Russell 1910). As such,
Weyl&rsquo;s views have justly been called <em>predicative</em>.
Despite these commonalities, Weyl was critical about what he saw as
the imprecision of Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s account, and he strongly
disagreed with several pillars of the Russellian approach. In
particular, he rejected some of the reductionist aspects of
Russell&rsquo;s logicism, which defined natural numbers by means of
equivalence classes, while Weyl took them to be fundamental. Weyl also
rejected Russell&rsquo;s axiom of reducibility and took their
positions to be &ldquo;separated by a veritable abyss&rdquo; (Weyl
1994: 47).</p>

<p>
In developing his system Weyl was guided by two key views. Firstly, he
agreed with Poincar&eacute; about the fundamentality to mathematical
thought of the idea of iteration, as embodied by the infinite sequence
of natural numbers. Secondly, he did not merely reject naive
comprehension and the idea that every concept (however precisely
defined) has an associated extension. Instead he proposed axioms, or
<em>principles of definition</em>, on which only what we now recognize
as first-order definable properties can be unproblematically taken to
have extensions. Weyl accepted that the use of his system would lead
to the loss of some mathematical principles that were accepted under
the set-theoretic orthodoxy of Cantor and Dedekind. One such casualty
was the least upper bound axiom, the principle that every bounded set
of real numbers has a least upper bound. Nevertheless, many important
consequences of the least upper bound axiom still hold in Weyl&rsquo;s
system, such as the monotone convergence theorem and a sequential form
of the Heine&ndash;Borel theorem.</p>

<p>
After the publication of <em>Das Kontinuum</em>, Weyl took an even
more radical step away from the set-theoretic view of analysis and
embraced Brouwer&rsquo;s
 <a href="../intuitionism/">intuitionism</a>.
 The subject of predicative analysis was not taken up again until the
1950s, when Grzegorczyk (1955) revisited Weyl&rsquo;s ideas using the
new tools of computability and definability theory. Grzegorczyk
identified Weyl&rsquo;s analysis with what he called, in common with
many at the time, <em>elementary analysis</em>, meaning that every
real number must be given by an elementary (that is to say,
first-order) definition. This amounted to studying analysis
constrained to the minimum \(\omega\)-model of \(\ACA_0\), the class
\(\ARITH\) of arithmetical sets. Kond&ocirc; (1958) and Mostowski
(1959) pursued similar approaches to elementary or arithmetical
analysis. All three were influenced by the developments in hierarchy
theory and its relationship to descriptive set theory, which
classifies sets of real numbers in terms of their descriptive
complexity. Kond&ocirc; in particular seems to have been influenced by
the French analysts and &ldquo;semi-intuitionists&rdquo; Borel, Baire,
and Lebesgue, who first developed what we now call descriptive set
theory in the early twentieth century. They used the tools of
Cantorian set theory to define hierarchies of sets and functions in
terms of the complexity of their construction (Kanamori 1995), but
were skeptical about many aspects of the Cantorian picture, including
the axiom of choice (Moore 1982).</p>

<p>
Both Grzegorczyk and Mostowski offer axiomatizations of their approach
to arithmetical analysis which are closely related to \(\ACA_0\).
Grzegorczyk&rsquo;s axioms (Grzegorczyk 1955: 337&ndash;338) are those
for Peano arithmetic, formulated in the simple theory of types, but
with comprehension restricted to formulas in which the only
quantifiers are those of the lowest type, that of natural numbers.
This restricted comprehension principle is thus a form of arithmetical
comprehension, albeit for higher types as well as for sets of natural
numbers. Mostowski, on the other hand, provides an axiomatization
derived from G&ouml;del&ndash;Bernays set theory \(\mathrm{GB}\)
(Mostowski 1959: 184&ndash;185). \(\mathrm{GB}\) is a two-sorted
theory in which the first sort of variables range over sets, and the
second sort over classes. In Mostowski&rsquo;s system, the first sort
of variables range over natural numbers and the second sort range over
sets of natural numbers. This produces an axiomatic system close to
\(\ACA_0\) whose minimum \(\omega\)-model is \(\ARITH\).</p>

<p>
As Feferman (1988) explores, there are several ways in which
\(\ACA_0\) does not completely correspond to Weyl&rsquo;s system. To
begin with, it is unclear whether Weyl would have accepted the full
induction scheme (\ref{eq:ind_scheme}), or just the induction axiom
(\ref{eq:ind_axiom}). \(\ACA_0\) only has the latter, and adding the
former produces the proof-theoretically stronger system \(\ACA\). Weyl
also admits an iteration principle (principle 8) that is not
first-order definable, although this discrepancy in his approach was
not known to him (Feferman 1998: 265). Nevertheless, the axioms of
\(\ACA_0\) can be justified on the predicative grounds given in
<em>Das Kontinuum</em>, and its substantial mathematical strength
shows that Weyl was right to think that systems in which only
first-order comprehension is admissible suffice for many applications.
For further reading on predicativity and its historical development,
see Feferman (2005). &sect;2.2 of Dean &amp; Walsh (2017) provides a
more complete account of the development of arithmetical analysis by
Grzegorczyk, Kond&ocirc;, and Mostowski.</p>

<h3 id="AritTranRecuLimiPred">5.5 Arithmetical transfinite recursion and the limits of predicativity</h3>

<p>
The renewed interest in predicative mathematics that materialized in
the 1950s following the discovery of the computability-theoretic
hierarchies
 (<a href="#AritDefiPred">&sect;5.4</a>)
 led to a series of conceptual and technical developments that
extended and refined the notions of predicative definability and
predicative provability, as well as offering sophisticated analyses of
these notions in terms of both computability theory and proof theory.
Following Grzegorczyk, Mostowski, and Kond&ocirc;&rsquo;s arithmetical
analysis of Weyl&rsquo;s predicativism
 (<a href="#AritDefiPred">&sect;5.4</a>),
 Kreisel (1960) suggested that sets of natural numbers were
predicative if they appeared in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy. On
the proof-theoretic side, this led to the identification of systems
like \(\Delta^1_1\text{-}\CA_0\) and
\(\Sigma^1_1\text{-}\mathsf{AC}_0\) as predicative (Kreisel 1962),
since the class of hyperarithmetical sets \(\HYP\) is an
\(\omega\)-model of both systems.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Kreisel&rsquo;s proposal still appeared to contain an
impredicative component. Any hyperarithmetical well-ordering is
predicatively definable, as a subset of the natural numbers, since by
a result of Spector (1955) such a well-ordering will in fact be
computable. However, the fact that the ordering is in fact a
well-ordering is not in general something that can be predicatively
determined: being a well-ordering is a \(\Pi^1_1\) property, since it
involves quantifying over all possible infinite descending sequences
in the ordering, or equivalently, over all subsets of the ordering.
Indeed, the set of all codes for computable well-orderings,
Kleene&rsquo;s \(\mathcal{O}\), is \(\Pi^1_1\)-complete and thus a
quintessentially impredicative object (Kleene 1955: 207). This worry
had already been noted by Kreisel (1960: 27), and the resulting idea
of examining which computable linear orderings could be predicatively
proved to be well-orderings led to a series of advances in the
1960s.</p>

<p>
Embodied in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy is the notion of
<em>ramification</em>: splitting the sets in \(\powset{\omega}\) into
levels which are built up via a transfinite iteration. This idea had
already appeared in several forms in Russell&rsquo;s attempts to
overcome the set-theoretic paradoxes and found mathematics on a
logicist basis. In the context of analysis and the predicative theory
of sets of natural numbers, the <em>ramified analytical hierarchy</em>
is a transfinite hierarchy of sets of natural numbers, defined by the
conditions </p> 
\[\begin{aligned}
    R_0            &amp; = \emptyset, \\
    R_{\alpha + 1} &amp; = (R_\alpha)^*, \\
    R_\lambda      &amp; = \bigcup_{\beta \lt \lambda} R_\beta
        \text{ when \(\lambda\) is a limit ordinal},
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
where \(D^*\) is the set obtained from \(D \subseteq \powset{\omega}\)
by putting \(X \in D^*\) iff there is an \(\calL_2\)-formula
\(\varphi\) such that for all \(n \in \bbN\), \(n \in X
\leftrightarrow \varphi(n)\) when all the second-order quantifiers in
\(\varphi\) are restricted to range over \(D\). The connection to
predicativity lies in the fact that second-order quantification is
admissible only if the range of quantification has already been shown
to exist, at some earlier stage in the construction of the hierarchy.
The hyperarithmetical sets were shown by Kleene (1959) to be exactly
those which appear in the ramified analytical hierarchy before stage
\(\wck\), i.e., \(\HYP= R_{\wck}\).</p>

<p>
Once provability is in the picture as a condition on the ordinals
\(\alpha\) which are to be considered predicative, one needs formal
systems in which such \(\alpha\) controls the length of the permitted
iteration of predicative definability. This gave rise to the
development of transfinite progressions of formal systems of
<em>ramified analysis</em>. The system \(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\)
associated with an ordinal \(\alpha\) has variables
\(X_1^\beta,X_2^\beta,\dotsc\) for each \(\beta \leq \alpha\), and
axioms asserting that the sets of the \(\beta\)-th level of the
ramified analytical hierarchy exists for all \(\beta \leq
\alpha\).</p>

<p>
The predicative ordinals can then be defined within this setting as
follows. If \(\alpha\) is a predicative ordinal, \(\prec\) is (a set
coding a) linear ordering, and \(\beta\) is the order-type of
\(\prec\), then \(\beta\) is predicative if \(\mathrm{RA}_\alpha
\vdash \mathrm{WO}(\prec)\). This is sometimes called the
<em>autonomy</em> condition. The predicative ordinals are thus
generated by starting from 0 and proving that larger and larger
ordinals are predicative, within stronger and stronger formal systems
\(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\), where \(\alpha\) has been shown to be
predicative within some weaker system \(\mathbf{RA}_\beta\) for
\(\beta \lt \alpha\). Feferman (1964) and Sch&uuml;tte (1965b, 1965a)
independently proved that the least impredicative ordinal is
\(\Gamma_0\), now known as the Feferman&ndash;Sch&uuml;tte ordinal or
the ordinal of predicativity. Thus we can characterize the
predicatively provable statements as those which can be proved in some
\(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\) for \(\alpha \lt \Gamma_0\).</p>

<p>
The proof-theoretic ordinal of \(\ATR_0\) is also \(\Gamma_0\), just
like the union of all predicative systems of ramified analysis
\(\mathbf{RA}_{\lt\Gamma_0} = \bigcup_{\alpha \lt \Gamma_0}
\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\). Moreover, \(\ATR_0\) is \(\Pi^1_1\)-conservative
over \(\mathbf{RA}_{\lt\Gamma_0}\), so any \(\Pi^1_1\) sentence
\(\varphi\) provable in \(\ATR_0\) will also be provable within some
\(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\) for \(\alpha \lt \Gamma_0\)&mdash;in order
words, \(\varphi\) will have a predicative proof. In line with the
 <a href="../proof-theory/#HilbProgExte">reductive program in proof theory</a>,
 systems which are proof-theoretically reducible to a system
\(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\) for \(\alpha \lt \Gamma_0\) are called
<em>predicatively reducible</em>. \(\ATR_0\) cannot be predicatively
reducible, since it is proof-theoretically reducible only to the union
of all predicative subsystems of ramified analysis, and can prove the
consistency of any individual \(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\) for \(\alpha \lt
\Gamma_0\). However, because of the conservativity result above,
\(\ATR_0\) is considered <em>locally predicatively reducible</em>, in
the sense that any \(\Pi^1_1\) consequence of \(\ATR_0\) can be
recovered within a predicative subsystem of ramified analysis.</p>

<p>
This property led Simpson (1985) to propose that \(\ATR_0\) could play
an important role in a program of <em>predicative reductionism</em>
analogous to the program of finitistic reductionism
 (<a href="#FiniReduWKL0">&sect;5.3</a>).
 The value of such a program would lie in the fact that while
arithmetical transfinite recursion is equivalent to many mathematical
theorems that cannot be recovered in the more obviously predicative
system \(\ACA_0\), few results have been found in the gap between
\(\ACA_0\) and \(\ATR_0\). This situation had already been noted in
the 1960s by Kreisel, who remarked that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in the portions of analysis developed by working mathematicians, a
theorem is either derivable by means of the arithmetic comprehension
axiom or else not predicative at all (not even true when relativized
to \(\HYP\) functions). (Kreisel 1962: 316) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
\(\ATR_0\), by contrast, proves many theorems in descriptive set
theory, algebra, and other areas of mathematics that cannot be proved
within individual predicative systems. The idea that it can be used
instrumentally by the predicativist to prove \(\Pi^1_1\) theorems
which are then, by the conservativity theorem, anointed as
predicatively legitimate, is one which holds some appeal.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this view is vulnerable to a version of the same
criticism advanced by Burgess (2010) against finitistic reductionism.
Although the predicativist will be able to prove the conservativity
theorem, and see that any \(\Pi^1_1\) theorem will be provable in some
\(\mathbf{RA}_\alpha\), this does not by itself give them a warrant
for the predicative provability of that theorem, since the
identification of predicative provability with provability in
\(\mathbf{RA}_{\lt\Gamma_0}\) is an external analysis predicated on,
amongst other things, the fact that \(\Gamma_0\) is a well-defined
object&mdash;something the predicativist is, if the
Feferman&ndash;Sch&uuml;tte analysis is correct, incapable of agreeing
to. They must instead verify that the proof given by the reduction is
indeed predicatively acceptable, and in the process check that the
relevant \(\alpha\) is a predicative ordinal. The advantage of the
reductionist approach must therefore lie, as Burgess points out, not
in a shortcut to predicative provability, but in some conceptual
advantage obtained by reasoning via the axiom scheme of arithmetical
transfinite recursion. Moreover, the very reverse mathematical results
that appear to make predicative reductionism an attractive prospect
also present a problem of sorts. Since statements like the perfect set
theorem are not merely provable in \(\ATR_0\), but actually equivalent
to its characteristic axiom, they themselves are strictly speaking
impredicative. It is therefore only their \(\Pi^1_1\) consequences
which can be obtained via the reduction, not the theorems
themselves.</p>

such as \(\mathsf{RT}^2_2\) which are not covered in detail by Simpson
(2009). Damir Dzhafarov and Carl Mummert&rsquo;s <em>Reverse
Mathematics: Problems, Reductions, and Proofs</em> (Dzhafarov &amp;
Mummert 2022) is a comprehensive introduction to contemporary reverse
mathematics which presents \(\sfRCA_0\)-provable entailment as just
one amongst many notions of reduction, and which also provides an
up-to-date treatment of many areas of importance in contemporary
reverse mathematics not covered by Simpson, especially combinatorial
principles and the Reverse Mathematics Zoo. John Stillwell&rsquo;s
<em>Reverse Mathematics: Proofs from the Inside Out</em> (Stillwell
2018) is an introductory book aimed at those with at least an
undergraduate-level education in mathematics and an interest in the
foundations of mathematics. Reverse mathematics is a relatively young
field within mathematical logic, and as such there is no definitive
history. Its origins and those of the main subsystems are traced in
Dean &amp; Walsh (2017), which also provides compendious references to
key historical sources.</p>

<p>
A general survey of the motivations, methods, techniques, and problems
of reverse mathematics is Shore (2010). Montalb&aacute;n (2011)
provides a list of open problems in reverse mathematics, although the
reader should be aware that many of them have now been solved, and
that the direction of research in reverse mathematics has shifted
somewhat since the publications of both (Montalb&aacute;n 2011) and
(Shore 2010). Two areas of particular note are underrepresented in
these surveys. The first is more fine-grained reducibility notions for
\(\Pi^1_2\) sentences, such as Weihrauch reducibility. A recent survey
of Weihrauch reducibility and computable analysis is Brattka,
Gherardi, &amp; Pauly (2021), while a more general discussion of
reducibility notions for \(\Pi^1_2\) sentences can be found in
Hirschfeldt &amp; Jockusch (2016). The second is <em>higher-order
reverse mathematics</em>, which modifies the formal framework of
second-order arithmetic to include third- and higher-order entities,
thereby allowing more direct formal representations of many
mathematical objects in analysis, topology, and the like. Shore (2010,
2013) proposes an approach to higher-order reverse mathematics using
higher recursion theory, but more influential has been
Kohlenbach&rsquo;s approach using higher-order arithmetic (Kohlenbach
2002, 2005). Some striking results have been proved in this framework.
For example, Normann &amp; Sanders (2019a) showed that third-order
formalizations of Cousin&rsquo;s and Lindel&ouml;f&rsquo;s lemmas both
imply full second-order arithmetic. Other recent work in higher-order
reverse mathematics studies transfinite recursion (Schweber 2015), the
strength of theorems of analysis such as Cousin&rsquo;s lemma and
properties of the gauge integral (Normann &amp; Sanders 2019b),
theorems about open sets (Normann &amp; Sanders 2020), and topological
notions like dimension and paracompactness (Sanders 2020).</p>

<p>
Finally, although issues relating to constructive and intuitionistic
mathematics have been addressed at several points, this entry focuses
almost exclusively on reverse mathematics in the setting of classical
logic. This leaves out the various approaches to reverse mathematics
in a constructive or intuitionistic setting. Contemporary forms of
constructive reverse mathematics were explicitly initiated by Ishihara
(2005, 2006) and Veldman (2009, 2014), but researchers in the field
often view Julian &amp; Richman (1984) as having proved the first
result in constructive reverse mathematics. Another notable early
example is Mandelkern (1988).
 <a href="../mathematics-constructive/#ConsReveMath">Section 5 of the entry on constructive mathematics</a>
 provides an introduction to constructive reverse mathematics, carried
out from within an informal base theory corresponding to
Bishop&rsquo;s constructivism. Diener (2020
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>])
 gives a compendious technical overview of results in the field, while
Loeb (2012) offers a critical appraisal of the program.</p>
