<h1>The Nature of Law</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun May 27, 2001; substantive revision Tue Apr 29, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Lawyers tend to raise questions about the content of the law or about
what the law requires on this or that issue. These are always local
questions, answers to which are bound to differ depending on the
jurisdiction. By contrast, philosophy of law is interested in a
general question: what is <em>law</em>? This question presupposes that
there are certain characteristics that law exhibits by its very
nature, or essence, as law, whenever and wherever it happens to exist,
characteristics that may be discernible through philosophical analysis.
General jurisprudence, as the philosophical project is sometimes
called, aims to give an account of law&rsquo;s nature, in the service,
ultimately, of several explanatory goals. A satisfying account is
supposed to shed light on what determines the content of legal norms;
on law&rsquo;s normative significance&mdash;both how it purports to
guide behavior and why it gives agents reasons for compliance; and on
the relationship, if any, between law and other bodies of norms, such
as the norms of morality or custom.</p>

<p>
But here, as elsewhere in philosophy, there are deep disagreements
about the desiderata for a satisfying account. It might even be
somewhat misleading to suggest that there is a single
question&mdash;what is law?&mdash;that unites the field, as opposed to
several related questions. For instance, there are at least two senses
in which the term &ldquo;law&rdquo; is used in jurisprudence: to refer
to a kind of norm (a legal norm), or to refer to a kind of normative
system (a legal system). Corresponding to these two senses are
different questions. One concerns the general conditions under which a
norm gets to be a norm of law&mdash;whether the conditions refer only
to the norm&rsquo;s source, such as its enactment by some political
institution, or also its content, such as its moral virtues. This is
the question of the &ldquo;grounds of legal validity.&rdquo; A
different but related question concerns the distinctive
characteristics of a body of norms that make it a system of law. This
is the question of the existence and persistence conditions of a legal
system. Additionally, some philosophers focus primarily on explaining
and justifying the normativity of law, and only secondarily on
law&rsquo;s nature. Their questions are several: how do legal norms
give rise to reasons for action, what kinds of reasons are involved,
and are there distinctively legal obligations.</p>

<p>
Section 1 considers these questions in turn and explains the main
substantive debates. Section 2 highlights some further methodological
issues that have generated recent discussion. As we&rsquo;ll see, over
the course of the last few centuries, two main rival philosophical
traditions have emerged about the grounds of legal validity. The older
one, with origins in classical Greek and Roman legal philosophy as
well as late mediaeval Christian scholarship, is called the
 <a href="../natural-law-theories/">natural law</a>
 tradition, and in its more secular and modern formulation associated
principally with the work of Ronald Dworkin,
&ldquo;non-positivism.&rdquo; Its unifying principle is the
proposition that the grounds of legality are partly moral in nature.
As the famous dictum, commonly attributed to (among others) Cicero,
Saint Augustine, and Aquinas, has it: <em>lex iniusta non est lex</em>
(unjust law is not law) (see e.g., Aquinas, Summa Theologica, I-II, Q.
96, Art. 4.) Since the early 19th century, the claim that the moral
content of norms partly determines their legality has been fiercely
challenged by the
 <a href="../legal-positivism/">legal positivism</a>
 tradition, promulgated by
 <a href="../bentham/">Jeremy Bentham</a>,
 <a href="../austin-john/">John Austin</a>, Hans Kelsen (see the entry on
 <a href="../lawphil-theory/">the pure theory of law</a>),
 H.L.A. Hart, and arguably anticipated in
 <a href="../hobbes-moral/">Hobbes&rsquo; political philosophy</a>.
 According to legal positivists, the conditions of legal validity, and
the grounds of law more generally, are a matter exclusively of social
or non-moral facts.</p>

<h2><a id="GenJur">1. General Jurisprudence</a></h2>

<h3><a id="ConLegVal">1.1 The Grounds of Legal Validity</a></h3>

<p>
A society may follow all kinds of norms that prescribe or prohibit
forms of behavior, such as the norms of etiquette, morality, or
tradition. But if the society has a legal system, then some of its
norms will be legal in nature. What determines whether a norm
qualifies as a legal norm of the community? We begin with a positivist
answer to this question. Positivists maintain that a community&rsquo;s
legal norms are determined exclusively by the beliefs, desires, and
conduct of its members&mdash;in other words, by social conditions.
What those precise conditions are has been subject to some debate.
Early legal positivists, for instance, held that the laws of a
community are determined by the commands issued by its
&ldquo;sovereign,&rdquo; construed as an agent, possibly a collective,
with the capacity to elicit obedience by credibly threatening sanction
(Austin 1832). These early theorists followed Hobbes in thinking that
law is, by its very nature, an instrument of social control employed
by those with power (military, economic, social, &hellip;) (cf. Kelsen
1945/61). </p>

<p>
There are a few things to note about this proposal. First, it aspires
to be perfectly general: true of all legal norms in any actual or
possible legal system. Second, the sense in which a sovereign&rsquo;s
commands determine the law is supposed to be non-causal and
constitutive. The causes of a legal norm&rsquo;s existence may be
several and antecedent to any sovereign command. For instance, if a
queen wishes to raise revenues to prosecute a war, the war may be part
of what causally explains her commands and any resulting legal norm.
But the occurrence of the war is not why the norm qualifies as law.
According to the Command Theorist, to be a legal norm <em>just is</em>
to be the content of a sovereign command (for further discussion, see
Part II).</p>

<p>
The Command Theory was challenged by later positivists on several
grounds. One set of objections centered on the content of legal norms,
not all of which impose duties. Whereas duty-imposing norms, such as a
norm that creates a tax obligation, can be easily understood in terms
of the content of a command (&ldquo;pay taxes!&rdquo;), the same is
not true of &ldquo;power-conferring&rdquo; norms (Hart 1961). These
are norms that confer various legal powers, say, to make wills,
contracts, or even new laws. A norm that specifies criteria for a
legally enforceable contract is hard to represent as the content of a
command. To whom is the command directed? Can it be said to require
anything at all insofar as it merely specifies how a type of legal
action can be performed? What, if any, are the consequences of
non-compliance? One could perhaps try to construe the norm in terms of
a command directed at other legal officials&mdash;to enforce a
contract that meets the relevant criteria. But this reconstruction
arguably distorts the norm&rsquo;s content, or so critics maintained.
A different objection questioned whether coercive relations among
agents are necessary or sufficient for the emergence of legal norms.
The theory seems to rule out the possibility of a cooperative and
well-intentioned community establishing a legal system without any
enforcement mechanism, one the relies solely on voluntary compliance
(Raz 1994). Another problem is that it&rsquo;s not obvious whether the
theory can explain the complex reasons people have for following the
law, which do not necessarily concern the prospect of sanction (for
further discussion, see 1.3). </p>

<p>
The Command Theory&rsquo;s shortcomings led Hart to develop an
alternative version of positivism that has been extremely influential.
Hart argued that in every legal system, the legality of first-order
norms&mdash;say, norms that prescribe or prohibit forms of
behavior&mdash;is determined, ultimately, be a set of more fundamental
or higher-order norms, what he called &ldquo;rules of recognition,
change, and adjudication.&rdquo; These higher-order norms are legal
wholly in virtue of being embraced by &ldquo;official&rdquo; members
of the community as worth following. Hart called this special attitude
of endorsement and obedience: &ldquo;the internal point of
view.&rdquo; On the resulting picture, socially embraced rules and
conventions take center stage that needn&rsquo;t be fully articulated
in any founding document or legal text, but that specify the means of
creating, modifying, and extinguishing laws. These foundational norms
underwrite all familiar &ldquo;sources of law,&rdquo; such as
constitutional or legislative acts and judicial decisions. Most
contemporary versions of legal positivism, discussed further below,
presuppose this basic Hartian framework.</p>

<p>
An important upshot of the framework is that a norm&rsquo;s legality
needn&rsquo;t depend on its moral merits. This &ldquo;Separation
Thesis,&rdquo; as it has come to be known, is the main source of
controversy in jurisprudence and, also, some confusion (see discussion
in Gardner 2001). Positivists do not deny that wherever law exists,
there is likely to be significant overlap between its content and
moral requirements. Nor do they deny that law, perhaps by its very
nature, deals with matters of moral concern. What they reject, at a
minimum, is a modal claim: that the legality of a norm depends
<em>necessarily</em> on its moral merits. Some positivists go further.
&ldquo;Exclusive&rdquo; legal positivists deny even the
<em>possibility</em> of the moral merits of a norm determining its
legality. To put the point in Hartian terms, exclusive positivists
argue that a community&rsquo;s rule of recognition cannot make the
legality of a norm depend on its moral merits (see Raz 1994 and
discussion in 1.3). Their view entails that the content of the law can
always be discerned, in principle, without recourse to a substantive
theory of morality. By contrast, &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; legal
positivists maintain that the moral merits of a norm may ground its
legality but only if a higher-order legal norm, itself grounded
exclusively in social facts, recognizes morality as a source of and
constraint on the law. On this picture, whenever the moral merits of a
norm contribute to its legality, it is wholly in virtue of contingent
socio-legal conventions within the community (Waluchow 1994, Coleman
1994, Kramer 2004).</p>

<p>
The Separation Thesis&mdash;whether understood in the exclusive or
inclusive sense&mdash;is controversial for several reasons. One reason
it that its denial has been a key tenet of an older tradition, namely,
Natural Law Theory, whose influence extends across legal history.
Early natural lawyers maintained that law, wherever and whenever it
exists, must conform in its content to some basic precepts of
universal morality&mdash;what theorists called &ldquo;natural
law.&rdquo; Most famously, Aquinas maintained that law <em>just
is</em> an &ldquo;ordinance of reason&rdquo; promulgated by one who
has &ldquo;care for the community.&rdquo; On one interpretation of
Aquinas&rsquo; claim, unless what the authorities require is
consistent with &ldquo;reason,&rdquo; the requirement is no law at
all. Notably, the famous dictum that an &ldquo;unjust law cannot be
law&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t simply a theoretical posit or implication; it
was likely informed by historical legal practice. The idea that the
norms of universal morality enjoy a kind of trans-jurisdictional and a
priori legality, either as default law or inviolable law, was very
widely embraced by jurists and legal officials (see discussion in Atiq
2023). Ordinary juridical intuitions have changed, however; and these
days, it is very difficult to maintain that unjust law cannot be law
(but see Flanagan &amp; Hannikainnen 2022). In light of clear
counterexamples, the natural law tradition has undergone considerable
refinement (see e.g., Finnis 1980, Moore 1992, Murphy 2006/12, Crowe
2019). Its leading defenders focus not so much on the legality of
individual norms within a legal system, but that of an entire system
of norms. And they afford morality a more subtle role within law, a
role that may or may not be inconsistent with the Separation Thesis as
we&rsquo;ll discuss in 1.2 (see also the entry on
 <a href="../natural-law-theories/">natural law theories</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The main contemporary challenge to the Separation Thesis stems from
Dworkin&rsquo;s body of work. Dworkin argued that positivists cannot
explain central aspects of legal reasoning and practice. One set of
arguments appealed to the role of &ldquo;principles&rdquo; in
adjudication. Judges and other legal officials tasked with figuring
out the law frequently base their conclusions on principles of justice
and fairness. Dworkin (1977) argued that the moral content, logical
form, and deliberative significance of these principles cannot be
captured or explained by social or conventional rules. A different
argument (1986) focused on the pervasiveness of &ldquo;theoretical
disagreement&rdquo; within law: officials routinely dispute the basic
criteria of legal validity within their system. Since positivists take
the basic criteria to be grounded in a degree of social consensus,
they seem committed to thinking that in many modern legal systems the
criteria are highly indeterminate. But jurists in those systems
presuppose a degree of determinacy that outstrips consensus and, so,
appear to implicitly reject legal positivism.</p>

<p>
Based on these arguments, Dworkin developed an alternative
&ldquo;non-positivist&rdquo; account of the grounds of legal validity
that differs quite radically from both positivism and natural law
theory. He argued that the distinction between what the law is and
what it ought to be is much more blurred than legal positivists would
have it. The argument relied on two main premises. First, Dworkin
maintained that determining what the law requires, or the content of
legal norms, necessarily involves &ldquo;interpretation.&rdquo; Any
statement of the form &ldquo;according to the law in <em>S</em>,
<em>x</em> has a right/duty etc., to <em>y</em>&rdquo; is a conclusion
of some interpretation or other of the community&rsquo;s social
practices. Second, interpretation always involves evaluative
considerations. An interpretation amounts to an account of what the
law requires that &ldquo;fits&rdquo; to some degree the social
practices of the community (judicial decisions, legislative actions,
and so on) and, at the same time, morally &ldquo;justifies&rdquo; the
practices. The &ldquo;best&rdquo; interpretation is one that optimally
balances considerations of fit and justification and, so, portrays the
community&rsquo;s law&mdash;what it requires&mdash;in its best
possible light. Dworkin took himself to be offering not just a theory
of adjudication, or a heuristic for figuring out the law, but an
account of the very nature of legal norms inspired by judicial
practice. In his own words, &ldquo;propositions of law are true if
they figure in or follow from the principles of justice, fairness, and
procedural due process that provide the best constructive
interpretation of the community&rsquo;s legal practice&rdquo; (Dworkin
1986, 225).</p>

<p>
Both Dworkin&rsquo;s Interpretivism and his arguments against
positivism have been challenged on various grounds. Positivists
maintain that the role of principles in adjudication, properly
understood, poses no threat to their view. Exclusive positivists argue
that Dworkin mistook judicial law-<em>making</em> for law-discovery
and that legal discovery is not nearly as &ldquo;interpretive&rdquo;
as Dworkin makes it out to be (Hart 1961, ch7, Raz 1972). Inclusive
legal positivists argue that Dworkin overgeneralized from practices
unique to American and English common law and that the contingent
practices are easily explained by inclusive positivism (Waluchow 1994,
Kramer 2004, Berman 2022). Likewise, Dworkin&rsquo;s argument from
theoretical disagreement has faced several objections. Some
positivists argue that genuine theoretical disagreements are in fact
quite rare (Leiter 2009). Others argue that jurists engaged in such
disagreements are filling gaps in the law or arguing about what the
law ought to be (Plunkett &amp; Sundell 2013, Watson 2023).
Additionally, Dworkin&rsquo;s own view seems vulnerable to objection
given its counterintuitive implications, such as the upshot that an
entire legal community may be mistaken about its laws simply in virtue
of being mistaken about what&rsquo;s &ldquo;morally best&rdquo;
(Marmor 2011: ch4). But these issues, together with the overarching
question of how ordinary legal practice constrains a philosophical
account of law, continue to be debated.</p>

<p>
Some contemporary non-positivists have developed an alternative to
Interpretivism that they claim is inspired by Dworkin&rsquo;s (2011)
later work. Instead of construing legal norms as entailed by the
&ldquo;best interpretation&rdquo; of social practices, defenders of
the &ldquo;One System&rdquo; view argue that legal norms are simply
grounded in (or identical to) those moral norms that obtain in virtue
of the community&rsquo;s social practices. On Greenberg&rsquo;s (2014)
development of the view, the law just is the &ldquo;moral
impact&rdquo; of the legally relevant social facts. His principal
argument relies on the claim that jurists take legal norms to exhibit
certain characteristics that only genuinely moral norms could possess,
such as being &ldquo;rationally intelligible&rdquo; based on the
social facts (2004). Other defenders of the One System view maintain
that legal officials make no distinction between what subjects
<em>legally</em> ought to do and what they <em>morally</em> ought to
do (see e.g., Hershovitz 2023 and discussion in 1.3). However, the One
System view is widely seen as hard to defend given its
counterintuitive implications about legal content (Dindjer 2020,
Watson 2022), contestable assumptions about ordinary legal practice,
and questionable interpretation of the use of deontic language by
lawyers and jurists (Wodak forthcoming).</p>

<p>
More moderate versions of non-positivism contest the Separation Thesis
by arguing that there might be normative criteria of legal validity
even if the law can be, and often is, morally defective (Simmonds
2008, Alexy 2010, Atiq 2020). These &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; conditions
concerning, e.g., the overall rationality or reasonableness of legal
norms, may be derivable from what it takes for a legal system to exist
(see discussion in 1.2). One general challenge for all non-positivist
theories, including natural law theory, interpretivism, the one-system
view, and any moderate alternatives, is to give an account of the
nature of moral and, more broadly, normative facts (see generally the
entry on
 <a href="../metaethics/">metaethics</a>).
 Many non-positivists defend a thoroughly objectivist stance with
respect to the nature and content of moral norms (see e.g., Finnis
1980, Dworkin 2011, Crowe 2019). Others argue that non-positivism can
be defended independently of one&rsquo;s metaethics (Atiq 2025a:
68&ndash;70).</p>

<h3><a id="LegSys">1.2 The Existence Conditions of Legal Systems</a></h3>

<p>
Hart&rsquo;s theory, though principally focused on the criteria of
legal validity, suggests a general recipe for what counts as a legal
system. A community needs a system of norms that exhibits higher-order
structure, and designated officials must adopt the internal point of
view towards, at a minimum, the higher-order norms of the
system&mdash;in particular, its Rule of Recognition. Recall that
Hart&rsquo;s theory was based, in part, on an extensional objection to
the Command Theory: it is questionable whether a system of raw power
and coercion&mdash;the &ldquo;gunman situation writ
large&rdquo;&mdash;qualifies as a legal system (Hart 1994: p19). But
Hart&rsquo;s own theory has been challenged on extensional grounds
(see e.g., Fuller 1978, Shapiro 2011). Fuller&rsquo;s famous test case
involves a hypothetical king, &ldquo;Rex,&rdquo; who purports to
govern a society based on rules that are radically ad hoc, specific,
non-public, retroactive, unclear, unstable and inconsistent. Fuller
suggests that Rex fails to create a legal system because a bona fide
system of law necessarily exhibits a degree of order&mdash;what he
called the &ldquo;inner morality of law&rdquo;&mdash;based on, among
other things, the generality, publicity, non-retroactivity, and
consistency of its norms (see also Dworkin 1965). A less controversial
way of putting Fuller&rsquo;s point is that it isn&rsquo;t clear
whether Rex&rsquo;s attempt at making law succeeds, and even if it
does, the legality of the resulting system is not so intuitive, a fact
that invites explanation (Atiq 2025a: 23&ndash;27).</p>

<p>
The characteristics that Fuller took to be essential to a legal system
have come to be known as the &ldquo;Rule of Law&rdquo; virtues (Raz
1979/2019, Kramer 2007, Waldron 2008). The ingredients of the Rule of
Law remain controversial, not just within legal philosophy, but in
political philosophy more broadly (see e.g., Waldron 2008, Railton
2018, and the entry on the
 <a href="../rule-of-law/">rule of law</a>).
 However, among legal philosophers there is broad agreement that the
Rule of Law understood along Fullerian lines defines a
&ldquo;kind-relative&rdquo; standard for evaluating law: that is, a
legal system is better, qua <em>legal system</em>, if it instantiates
characteristics like generality, publicity, and consistency (see
discussion in Atiq 2025b). Notably, kind-relative standards of
evaluation are pervasive (Thomson 2008). While the standard for being
good &ldquo;as a knife&rdquo; is different from the standard for being
good &ldquo;as a clock,&rdquo; some general observations can be made
about this mode of evaluation. For instance, to say that something is
good &ldquo;as an x&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., as a scientific theory or as a
weapon of mass destruction&mdash;is not to say that it is good,
period, or <em>morally</em> good (on this point, see Marmor 2004,
Scanlon 2025). What&rsquo;s being said exactly is subject to some
debate, but it is tempting to think there must be an explanation for
why instances of certain kinds, such as law, are uniquely evaluable in
terms of a select class of characteristics. </p>

<p>
On the positivist side, there are at least two influential
explanations. Fuller (1978) invokes a &ldquo;functional&rdquo;
explanation. Generally, kind-relative virtues (like being sharp)
appear to be characteristics that enable the performance of those
functions (such as cutting) that inform our conception of what it is
to be an instance of the relevant kind (a knife). And one might expect
this mode of explanation to extend to the kind-relative virtues of
institutional and abstract artifacts, such as law. Accordingly, Fuller
argues that law has a constitutive function&mdash;in particular,
subjecting people&rsquo;s behavior to the &ldquo;guidance of
rules&rdquo;&mdash;and the Rule-of-Law characteristics enable law to
perform this function (cf. Hart 1994). That is what makes
characteristics like consistency and non-retroactivity distinctively
legal virtues. Raz (2019; cf. 1979) argued against such accounts and
defended an alternative proposal: the Rule of Law constitutes
&ldquo;the specific virtue of the law <em>as</em> law&rdquo; because
&ldquo;[it] protects us from wrongs for which the law&rsquo;s
existence creates opportunities.&rdquo; Raz maintained that the
specific wrong that is risked wherever law exists is &ldquo;abuse of
power,&rdquo; and the Rule-of-Law characteristics mitigate this risk.
</p>

<p>
Both natural lawyers and more moderate non-positivists have questioned
the adequacy of such explanations. Natural lawyers maintain that the
Fullerian Rule-of-Law characteristics do not exhaust the class of
distinctively legal virtues. It is not just characteristics like
generality or publicity that make a legal system better <em>as a legal
system</em>, but also the degree to which the system conforms to moral
requirements. The striking claim that the moral merits of law are
kind-relative merits has arguably supplanted, as the core natural-law
thesis, the traditional dictum regarding unjust laws. Natural lawyers
have defended the thesis in different ways. Some argue that a system
of norms is better as a legal system when it is morally good because
&ldquo;prototypical&rdquo; or &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; examples of
legal systems are either morally good or aim at morally good outcomes
(Finnis 1980, cf. Murphy 2005/06). Others treat legal norms as
commands that presuppose that subjects have moral reasons to comply,
commands that are defective <em>as commands</em> when the relevant
presuppositions are false (Alexy 2010/21, Murphy 2012). A more recent
approach treats law as an artifact that serves the function of
creating a sense of obligation within the community, a function that
is allegedly frustrated when the law is morally unjustified (Crowe
2019).</p>

<p>
Although a detailed examination of these theories is not possible
here, one issue that stands out is that the considerations natural
lawyers invoke to explain why the moral merits of law are
kind-relative merits do not seem consistent with, or informed by, a
<em>general</em> theory of kind-relative virtue (Atiq 2025a:
36&ndash;43). For instance, not every prototypical feature of
knives&mdash;such as having only a single sharp edge&mdash;bear on the
kind-relative standard for being good as a knife. Likewise, not every
regular use to which a knife can be put or function it might serve
(e.g., to open containers) bears on the relevant standard. Mutatis
mutandis for other goodness-fixing kinds. So, even if legal systems
are prototypically good, or are often leveraged to promote morally
good outcomes, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily explain why moral
goodness would be a distinctively legal virtue.</p>

<p>
In order to preserve explanatory unity, more moderate non-positivists
agree with positivists that law&rsquo;s kind-relative virtues should
be understood narrowly&mdash;in more or less Fullerian terms&mdash;and
explained, as kind-relative virtues usually are, as characteristics
that enable the law to perform its constitutive function(s); but they
levy a different challenge. The thinly described functions that
positivists take to be constitutive of law, such as subjecting conduct
to the guidance of rules, may not explain all of the Rule-of-Law
virtues. For instance, while the law must be consistent and
non-retroactive to effectively guide conduct, it is not so clear why
it must also be general in application rather than particular.
Explaining the full spectrum of Rule-of-Law virtues may require
identifying some other function that law constitutively serves,
perhaps a function that must be understood in essentially normative
terms, such as fostering &ldquo;procedural fairness&rdquo; in society
(Atiq 2025b).</p>

<p>
How do such claims about law&rsquo;s functions or virtues relate to
the Separation Thesis? Natural lawyers have given a broad range of
mostly non-definitive answers to this question (see discussion in
Murphy 2012). Meanwhile, positivists maintain that the claims are
entirely consistent with positivist criteria of legal validity. For
instance, Shapiro (2011) embraces the notion that legal systems are
systems of interlocking norms adopted as part of an overarching
&ldquo;plan&rdquo; with a &ldquo;moral aim&rdquo;&mdash;namely, the
realization of the general good. However, he argues that even if
&ldquo;it is part of the nature of law to have a moral aim&rdquo; that
doesn&rsquo;t entail that &ldquo;the failure to attain this end
undermines the law&rsquo;s identity as law,&rdquo; and so the moral
goodness of a legal system isn&rsquo;t a precondition for its
existence or for the legality of individual norms (p392). The proposal
confronts various challenges concerning what it means to attribute a
shared moral plan to members of a community (see Plunkett 2013).
Another problem with Shapiro&rsquo;s argument is that although it is
true that instances of functional kinds can be more or less at good at
performing kind-functions, <em>radical</em> failures to perform
kind-functions do seem to interfere with kind-membership (consider a
blunt piece of scrap metal intended as a knife but that&rsquo;s
entirely useless at cutting things). If that&rsquo;s right, then a
system&rsquo;s radical failure to realize law&rsquo;s moral or
normative aims may well prevent it from qualifying as a legal system,
an implication that threatens the Separation Thesis. But these issues
are far from settled. One productive upshot of recent debates is the
growing recognition that a satisfying account of law&rsquo;s nature
will invariably need a view on more general concepts and phenomena of
philosophical interest, such as artifacts, functions, and
kind-relative evaluation.</p>

<h3><a id="NorLaw">1.3 The Normativity of Law</a></h3>

<p>
It is widely assumed that the law makes a genuine difference to what
subjects have reason to do independently of its content. But why
should the law make a content-independent normative difference and how
does it purport to guide its subjects? The Command Theory offers a
simple answer: our reasons for obeying the law are of the same species
as reasons for complying with the gunman&rsquo;s threat (&ldquo;your
money or your life&rdquo;). The motivational psychology of the
obedient can be explained in terms of ordinary prudence and the belief
that the law&rsquo;s threats are credible. As discussed previously,
early legal positivists, such as Bentham (1893), Austin (1832), and
Kelsen (1945) took coercion to be an essential feature of law, one
that distinguishes it from other normative domains. Their analysis of
law and legal content entailed a straightforwardly reductive account
of legal normativity.</p>

<p>
Despite its enduring influence outside of philosophy, the account is
widely seen as inadequate. Hart argued that the law&rsquo;s sanctions,
unlike the gunman&rsquo;s threats, are viewed by participants within
legal practice as justified, and deviations from legal norms tend to
be criticized in ways that are hard to square with the Command Theory
and its &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; model of the psychology of the
compliant (Hart 1961, 82, cf. Kelsen 1945). However, Hart didn&rsquo;t
clarify why people regard the law&rsquo;s sanctions as justified or,
for that matter, the ingredient thoughts that make up &ldquo;the
internal point of view&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the normative attitudes
of officials who view the law as &ldquo;worth following&rdquo; (see
discussion in Holton 1998, Toh 2005, Kaplan 2023a). Still,
Hart&rsquo;s criticisms are generally viewed as successful and have
been developed further. One problem with the Command Theory is that it
doesn&rsquo;t explain the reasons many of the law&rsquo;s subjects and
legal officials have for following the law when the content of legal
norms is unclear or subject to reasonable disagreement.</p>

<p>
A more promising approach is found in Joseph Raz&rsquo;s (1994)
account of legal authority. Raz argued that the law is, essentially,
an authoritative institution: it is a de facto practical authority and
&ldquo;claims&rdquo; legitimate authority. A practical authority
mediates between subjects and their reasons for action by issuing
directives ostensibly based on those reasons. An authority is
legitimate if and only if subjects are more likely to do what they
have independent reasons to by following the authority&rsquo;s
directives instead of trying to figure out for themselves what&rsquo;s
reasonable. For example, the legal directive to stay under the speed
limit is an instance of legitimate authority because by following it
drivers respond to their reasons more effectively than if they tried
to figure out the appropriate speed in the various circumstances one
encounters on the road.</p>

<p>
Raz&rsquo;s theory suggests that subjects have content-independent
reasons to comply with the law insofar as the law is a legitimate
authority. The theory also has implications concerning legal content
that are favorable to Exclusive Legal Positivism (see 1.1). If the law
consists of authoritative directives, legal norms must stem from
agents capable of forming an opinion on how subjects ought to behave,
distinct from the subjects&rsquo; own judgments about their reasons
for action. If the law claims legitimate authority, it must be the
kind of thing that&rsquo;s capable of making or presupposing such
claims. In short, authority requires authorship. Additionally, the
content of an authoritative directive must be identifiable in a way
that doesn&rsquo;t defeat the point of the directive, which is to
settle the question of what subjects should do. Raz concluded from
these considerations that the content of legal norms must be
discernible independently of moral or other evaluative considerations.
Raz&rsquo;s argument directly challenges theories that treat
&ldquo;unauthored&rdquo; moral norms as law as well as those that
treat morality as a possible criterion of legal validity (see
discussion of Inclusive Legal Positivism in 1.1). But the
argument&rsquo;s starting points, including the assumption that all
legal norms must fit the model of a directive, are contested (see
generally Kramer 2004).</p>

<p>
A different puzzle about legal normativity stems from the positivist
thesis that legal norms are essentially grounded in social
conventions. Some legal philosophers claim that conventional rules
cannot, by themselves, obligate. For instance, Leslie Green (1996,
1967) observes that Hart&rsquo;s &ldquo;view that the fundamental
rules [of recognition] are &lsquo;mere conventions&rsquo; [sits]
uneasily with any notion of obligation,&rdquo; which Green considers a
problem because the rules of recognition point to &ldquo;sources [of
law] that judges are <em>legally</em> bound to apply.&rdquo; Others
argue that legal conventions are coordinating conventions in
Lewis&rsquo; (1968) sense, but distinguishable in that subjects are
morally obligated to solve the underlying coordination problems (cf.
Finnis 1989). An influential approach takes law&rsquo;s fundamental
conventions to be <em>constitutive</em> rules, similar to the rules of
games and other social activities. The practices constituted by such
rules realize unique values that may, in turn, ground reasons to
participate or otherwise support the practice, at least conditional on
one&rsquo;s interests. Some philosophers appeal to the Rule of Law:
legal systems that conform to the Fullerian requirements realize
something of moral value independently of the substantive content of
legal norms (Fuller 1978, Waldron 2008). One problem for this view is
that a legal system&rsquo;s compliance with the Rule of Law is
compatible with a great deal of injustice and oppression, so
it&rsquo;s unclear how the Rule of Law can underwrite a general
obligation to follow or support the law (Kramer 2007). In fact, one
might conclude from these difficulties that subjects&rsquo; reasons
for complying with the law can only be grounded in their own
subjective attitudes, such as respect for the law (cf. Raz 1979), or
their prior commitments to obey the law (see Valentini 2024, Jimenez
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Some of these discussions concerning our obligations risk conflating
two different issues. The moral question of whether judges, or anybody
else, should respect the rules of a legal system can only be resolved
by moral and more broadly normative arguments. This question is
extensively discussed in the literature on political obligation (see
the entries on
 <a href="../political-obligation/">political obligation</a>
 and
 <a href="../legal-obligation/">legal obligation</a>.)
 At the same time, there is arguably a practice-internal sense of
obligation on which an agent who participates in a practice&mdash;say,
a judge or some other official within a legal system&mdash;is
obligated to follow its rules. A referee in a soccer game is
&ldquo;obliged&rdquo; to follow the rules of the game, and the fact
that the game is conventional poses no difficulty in making sense of
this notion. Some construe this sense of obligation in terms of a
practice&rsquo;s &ldquo;perspective&rdquo; on our genuine
practice-independent obligations (Raz 2009, Coleman 2011). The
challenge, on this view, is to explain what it means for a practice to
have a perspective on what agents should do, and in a way that&rsquo;s
compatible with a range of complex arguments and constructions
involving the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; ought (see e.g., Perry 2023).
Others invoke practice-internal norms and practice-internal values to
explain the relevant species of deontic judgments (Kaplan 2023b), and
endeavor to clarify the scope and force of official
&ldquo;obligations&rdquo; to follow the law in terms of legal content
(Atiq 2019). On either approach, a legal obligation to follow the law
doesn&rsquo;t settle the moral question. Even if law, unlike soccer or
chess, is a kind of practice that people have a practice-independent
obligation to participate in, the latter must emerge from all things
considered normative considerations.</p>

<p>
Notably, the existence of a distinctly legal concept of obligation, or
distinctly legal reasons, remains very much contested (Greenberg 2014;
Enoch 2011; Wodak 2019, forthcoming). Some (e.g., Enoch) argue that
there is no deep difference in the way that legal norms affect
subjects&rsquo; reasons for action compared to other types of norms.
Meanwhile, proponents of the One System View treat claims about legal
obligation as identical to, or at least grounded in, claims about
moral obligation (Greenberg 2014, Hershovitz 2015). Still others have
endeavored to make sense of practice-internal deontic claims as
expressive of a speaker&rsquo;s &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; of the
practice and its norms (Toh 2005/10, Finlay &amp; Plunkett 2018) or,
even, as a kind of pretense or &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; concerning what
agents should do (Wodak 2019, forthcoming).</p>

<p>
This concludes our review of the main substantive debates in general
jurisprudence. In recent years, there has been some impetus to shift
the focus away from the Hart-Dworkin debate, the Separation Thesis,
and other traditional issues (see e.g., Hershovitz 2015). As
discussed, there is growing interest in the artifactual and functional
nature of law (Burazin et al. 2018, Marmor 2023, Ehrenberg 2016, Atiq
2025a). Another new and potentially fruitful avenue of research draws
on the philosophy of language to shed light on questions of legal
interpretation and legal content (see e.g., Asgeirsson 2015, Marmor
2014, Wodak forthcoming). This linguistic turn is not uncontroversial,
however, given skepticism among some legal philosophers about the idea
that legal interpretation is fundamentally a linguistic enterprise
(Greenberg 2011, Dworkin 1986). Finally, there is growing interest in
clarifying the metaphysical notions&mdash;such as of grounding and
essence&mdash;that legal philosophers use to state their central
theses (Rosen 2010, Marmor 2023). Some of these more methodological
debates are the focus of Part 2.</p>

<h2><a id="MetJur">2. The Methodology of Jurisprudence</a></h2>

<p>
Methodological debates in jurisprudence concern both its subject
matter&mdash;that is, what a philosophical account of law is supposed
to be an account of&mdash;and the explanatory demands that a
satisfying account is supposed to meet. There are five main approaches
to these issues that we&rsquo;ll discuss in turn. One view takes the
subject of investigation to be a concept of law, and jurisprudence to
be a form of conceptual analysis. This approach is often associated
with Hart&rsquo;s influential work: <em>The Concept of Law</em>
(1994). A second approach is skeptical of conceptual methodologies and
takes legal philosophy to be in the business of offering a
metaphysical or reductive explanation of law itself, not some concept
of it. A third approach conceives of general jurisprudence as another
branch of meta-normative inquiry, which renders it continuous with
other subfields in philosophy like metaethics. A fourth view&mdash;the
prescriptive approach&mdash;focuses on practical questions such as
whether adopting a positivist or non-positivist conception of law
leads to better social outcomes. A fifth view, associated principally
with Dworkin&rsquo;s work, takes legal theory to be a fundamentally
&ldquo;interpretive&rdquo; enterprise that is both descriptive and
evaluative. A general issue these methodological debates raise is
whether and to what extent moral commitments must shape or constrain
an account of law&rsquo;s nature.</p>

<h3><a id="ConAnaVie">2.1 Conceptual Analysis</a></h3>

<p>
Some theorists take a concept of law to be the primary target of
philosophical analysis. Their goal is to characterize the concept in a
way that is compatible with our intuitions about it (or about cognate
concepts of legal validity, legal obligation, and the like). But what
does it mean to characterize a concept? Depending on one&rsquo;s
theory of concepts (see the entry on
 <a href="../concepts/#ProThe">concepts</a>),
 it might mean characterizing the concept&rsquo;s criteria of
application (on a classical/criterial theory), typical and atypical
instances (on a prototype/exemplar theory), or the concept&rsquo;s
functional role in reasoning and action (on a broadly use-theoretic or
inferential approach). The characterization is constrained by our
conceptual intuitions, which might include extensional judgments
regarding the instances that fall under the concept, as well as
judgments about a priori connections across distinct concepts. To
illustrate, a criterial theorist offers an account of the necessary
and sufficient criteria for correctly applying the concept of law to
norms or systems of norms. The account&rsquo;s success turns on
whether it yields intuitively correct results about particular cases
and does so in an explanatorily satisfying way as opposed to an ad hoc
manner. For a more in-depth discussion of the methodology of
conceptual analysis in legal philosophy, see Raz (2004), Shapiro
(2011, 16&ndash;22).</p>

<p>
A key question this approach raises concerns the source and
reliability of the &lsquo;raw data&rsquo; for the theory&mdash;namely,
our basic conceptual intuitions. What does it take have the right
intuitions about the concept of law? Jurisprudence has been strongly
influenced by two competing answers to this question.</p>

<p>
The first takes reliable conceptual intuitions to be mainly a matter
of linguistic competence. That is, to possess the concept of law one
simply needs to know the semantic rules associated with the word
&ldquo;law&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s employed in juridical contexts (in
contrast, e.g., to scientific usage). This sort of view was famously
discussed in chapters 1 and 2 of Dworkin&rsquo;s <em>Law&rsquo;s
Empire</em> (Dworkin 1986, 32, 43&ndash;46). It traces back to the
kind of ordinary language philosophy that&rsquo;s associated with L.
Wittgenstein, J.L. Austin and Gilbert Ryle. Recently, philosophers who
endorse similar methodological assumptions but hope to canvas a
broader range of intuitions have adopted the methods of social
psychology to test how the &ldquo;folk&rdquo; use the legal concept to
classify cases that feature in philosophical thought experiments (see
e.g., Flannagan &amp; Hannikainen 2022). <!-- , and the entry on
 <a href="../experimental-jurisprudence/">experimental 
jurisprudence</a>).-->
</p>
 
<p>
But the linguistic account of conceptual intuition faces serious
challenges. Perhaps the biggest source of concern is that it implies
an account of legal theories that is vulnerable to Dworkin&rsquo;s
(1986, 43&ndash;46) &ldquo;semantic sting&rdquo; argument, which can
be summarized as follows. If legal theories are &ldquo;semantic&rdquo;
in nature, then disagreements about the grounds of legal validity must
boil down to disagreements about the criteria for applying the term
&ldquo;law&rdquo; correctly. But now a dilemma arises. Either legal
practitioners possess the same concept or they do not. If they possess
the same concept, then it seems they cannot fail to agree about the
grounds of legal validity. After all, if they have the same concept,
they should know the criteria for applying the associated term
correctly and hence the grounds. But this is implausible since legal
practice is rife with disagreement about the grounds of legal validity
(see 1.1). On the other hand, if legal practitioners do <em>not</em>
share the same concept of law, then their disagreements must be a case
of talking past each other. But that, too, is implausible. Fundamental
disagreements among sophisticated practitioners, as Dworkin puts it,
is not &ldquo;a grotesque joke&rdquo; (Dworkin 1986, 44; but see
Plunkett &amp; Sundell 2013). Accordingly, there must be something
wrong with construing legal theories as semantic accounts of the
criteria for applying the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; correctly.</p>

<p>
Dworkin concluded based on his argument that legal theories
aren&rsquo;t exercises in conceptual analysis. One could accept this
conclusion without adopting Dworkin&rsquo;s own account of what legal
theorists are really up to (see discussion in 2.2 and 2.5).
Alternatively, a defender of conceptual analysis might respond that
&ldquo;concept mastery&rdquo; is not simply a matter of knowing the
rules that govern the associated term. On this way of going, concept
mastery involves possessing a wide range of substantive beliefs or
intuitions about a concept in circumstances of full information and
having been exposed to a broad range of counterfactual considerations.
This richer view of conceptual analysis in legal theory is discussed
in, e.g., Raz (2004, 4&ndash;7); Stravopoulos (2012, 78&ndash;79);
Shapiro (2011, 16&ndash;22); Finnis (2007: p. 276), and Atiq (2025a:
4&ndash;9, 59&ndash;65). It is perhaps also the sort of view
presupposed by Hart. On this view, legal practitioners might use the
same concept of law and be perfectly competent with the semantic rules
associated with legal terminology, yet nevertheless disagree about the
law&rsquo;s grounds because they haven&rsquo;t fully understood the
concept or its application conditions.</p>

<p>
Even if this approach avoids Dworkin&rsquo;s semantic sting, it
remains vulnerable to other criticisms (Marmor 2011, 215&ndash;217;
Raz 2004, 10; Leiter 2007, 177&ndash;79). One question it raises is
<em>whose</em> concept of law, exactly, constitutes the proper target
of legal theory. Is it a concept of law possessed by legal
practitioners in a particular jurisdiction (or embraced by
philosophers at elite universities)? Or is it a universally shared
concept? Worries loom either way. If the target is a
&ldquo;local&rdquo; concept, then legal theory seems parochial in a
way that philosophy aspires not to be. If it&rsquo;s a universally
shared concept, it&rsquo;s unclear why there are any interesting
truths to discover beyond obvious platitudes accessible through
linguistic competence alone. It&rsquo;s worth noting, here, that this
is an instance of a more general puzzle about how a philosophical
analysis of a shared concept can be both correct and informative at
the same time (see the entry on
 <a href="../analysis/">analysis</a>).
 And there a range of responses to the general problem that might be
applicable here as well (see e.g., Chalmers &amp; Jackson 2001).</p>

<p>
A different question the approach raises is why we should care about
anybody&rsquo;s <em>concept</em> of law in the first place (Marmor
2013, 216&ndash;217; Leiter 2007, 177&ndash;79; Raz 2004, 7, 10).
Granted, there are interesting sociological questions to be asked
about what various groups of people believe about law. But it is not
obvious that there is anything distinctively philosophical about such
questions. Philosophers, on a standard conception, are interested in
what people believe about a given concept as a route to understanding
what the concept refers to (Raz 2004, 4, 10). Accordingly, one might
think that what legal theories aim to capture is not anybody&rsquo;s
concept of law, but rather the nature of law itself.</p>

<p>
This challenge can be addressed in a few different ways. One response
treats law as a social phenomenon that&rsquo;s partly constituted by
people&rsquo;s own understanding of it. On this view, people&rsquo;s
conceptual intuitions about law ground what law really is
(Stravopoulos 2012, 79; cf. Raz 1979: 221, Raz 2001). Still, one might
wonder why we should limit ourselves to asking questions about
concepts if law can be studied directly. A different response to the
problem emphasizes connections between the concept of law and other
core concepts of philosophical interest (of normativity, artifacts,
and so on). On this view, philosophical interest in the concept of law
is part of a larger effort to keep our overall conceptual scheme in
order. A third and more radical response embraces a Platonic
conception of concepts, according to which they are not mental
representations at all, or even necessarily tied to words or language,
but rather abstract objects akin to the objects of mathematical
inquiry. Accordingly, it is an abstract object&mdash;<em>the</em>
concept of law&mdash;that philosophers investigate using their a
priori methods (cf. Bealer 1998). This account faces familiar
epistemic puzzles about access and how different people who all
determinately grasp the same concept of law could end up disagreeing
about its nature (Sarch 2010, 468&ndash;73). One might respond to this
epistemic challenge by embracing pluralism: there are as many Platonic
concepts as there are consistent definitions. But the question we
raised earlier arises again: why care about some philosopher&rsquo;s
favorite concept as opposed to any other concept? In any case, one
point of similarity between the Platonic view and the reductive
approach we are about to discuss is that both consider the primary
target of investigation to be something that admits of an objective
characterization independently of anyone&rsquo;s conception of it.</p>

<h3><a id="InvLawIts">2.2 Metaphysical Reduction</a></h3>

<p>
Given their doubts about conceptual analysis, some theorists have
proposed that legal theories are primarily in the business of
describing and explaining the nature of law itself. More precisely,
&ldquo;reductionist&rdquo; views take illuminating the nature of law
to be a matter of explaining what the law is, and how it operates, in
terms of more fundamental facts (Rosen 2010, Marmor 2023). A
successful reduction would demonstrate that legal facts are
constituted by, or fully grounded in, other more foundational facts in
the way that the facts of chemistry might be reduced to the facts of
physics. Construed along these lines, positivism reduces facts about
what the law is to social facts&mdash;e.g., facts about people&rsquo;s
behavior, beliefs and dispositions. Reductionist views needn&rsquo;t
completely eschew the methods discussed in 2.1, but they must offer a
different explanation of the relevance of intuition. For a more
in-depth discussion of these issues, see Rosen (2010), Schroeder
(2007, 61&ndash;83), Chilovi &amp; Pavlakos (2019); and Marmor (2023);
as well as the entries on
 <a href="../grounding/">metaphysical grounding</a>
 and
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">scientific reduction</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Notably, reductionists face a version of the &ldquo;shared subject
matter&rdquo; objection to conceptualist views. What ensures that
legal philosophers are all investigating the same set of facts or
phenomenon? Why assume, in particular, that non-positivists are in the
business of explaining the ostensibly social phenomenon that interests
positivists? Such questions are pressing both because
law&mdash;understood as a kind of norm or normative system&mdash;is
not something we easily pick out by ostensive reference (contrast
scientific phenomena), and because legal philosophers tend not to
share the same starting points or a priori intuitions about their
subject. So, there is a risk of talking past here just as there is on
the conceptual view. One possibility is that there is enough overlap
in starting points for exchange between positivists and
non-positivists to be productive even if there isn&rsquo;t a single
shared subject matter. It may turn out that legal philosophers are
interested in a range of distinct but related facts that invite
reduction and that raise a common set of explanatory puzzles
concerning, e.g., their normativity.</p>

<p>
One reductionist approach, prominently defended by Brian Leiter
(2007), is known as &ldquo;naturalized jurisprudence.&rdquo; Like
other reductionist views, naturalized jurisprudence takes the aim of
legal theories to be explaining the nature of law itself (not
anybody&rsquo;s concept of law). But a distinguishing characteristic
is the insistence on a purely empirical methodology and rejection of
intuitionistic or a priori methods (see the entry on
 <a href="../lawphil-naturalism/">naturalism in legal philosophy</a>.).
 Leiter (2007: 81, 180&ndash;99, 184) argues that our intuitions about
law are too unreliable to be afforded much epistemic weight (as others
have argued with respect to intuitions in other areas of philosophy;
cf. Cummins 1998, Johnston &amp; Leslie 2012). Instead,
&ldquo;philosophical theorizing [should be] continuous with and
dependent upon scientific theorizing&rdquo; (Leiter 2007: p35). The
way to achieve such continuity is for legal philosophers to determine
which &ldquo;concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory
and predictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial
behavior&rdquo; (p184). But a question arises as to why judicial
behavior, in particular, invites explanation and prediction as opposed
to, say, people&rsquo;s judgments about law more broadly. More
generally, the naturalist must motivate their account of the
&ldquo;legal phenomena&rdquo; that invite explication. On a broader
conception of our explanatory goals, it may turn out that naturalized
jurisprudence is just one part of, and so largely compatible with, a
version of the conceptual view where the express goal is &ldquo;to
develop a concept for use in a theoretical explanation,&rdquo; albeit
an explanation, in part, of shared intuitions (Finnis 2007: p276).</p>

<h3><a id="MetNorm">2.3 Metanormative Inquiry</a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the conceptual and reductive methodologies, properly
understood, aren&rsquo;t as incompatible as they might appear. On some
conceptions of general jurisprudence, e.g., construed as just another
branch of &ldquo;metanormative&rdquo; inquiry (partly inspired by H.
Kelsen&rsquo;s theory of normativity; see the entry on the
 <a href="../lawphil-theory/">pure theory of law</a>),
 there is room for both methodologies. Plunkett and Shapiro (2017)
point out that the goal of meta-normative inquiry is to explain how
normative thought, talk, and entities (if any) fit into reality.
Metaethics is one branch of metanormative inquiry, which focuses on
how <em>ethical</em> thought, talk and entities (if any) fit into
reality. Metalegal inquiry is another branch that similarly
investigates both legal language and legal reality. The key insight,
here, is that there is more than one question or set of questions that
legal philosophers should be interested in. Thus, instead of replacing
other methodologies, the meta-normative view, if sound, simply rejects
a privileged starting point for jurisprudential inquiry. Some
theorists might start with the metaphysics of legal content or systems
of law. Others might privilege semantic analyses of legal statements.
What matters is whether our commitments are compatible overall and can
be subsumed under a general and more comprehensive theory.</p>

<h3><a id="PreVie">2.4 Prescriptive Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
The methodologies we&rsquo;ve discussed so far are, or at least
purport to be, descriptive. By contrast, some approaches to
understanding law are explicitly prescriptive: their goal is to
identify a conception of law whose adoption by, say, judges, lawyers,
and others will lead to desirable outcomes, regardless of whether the
conception is consistent with what law really is or our
pre-theoretical understanding of law.</p>

<p>
One prominent advocate of an exclusively prescriptive project is Neil
MacCormick (MacCormick 1985; see also Campbell 1996; Murphy 2001;
Postema 1989; Schauer 1996; Waldron 2001, Jim&eacute;nez 2023).
MacCormick (1986, 35&ndash;36) argues that there are compelling
normative arguments in favor of adopting a positivist conception of
law. In particular, he suggests that values like autonomy and freedom
of conscience militate in favor of keeping the question of what the
law requires entirely separate from the question of what morality
requires, at least in certain spheres of conduct governed by law. The
idea seems to be that a legal system is more likely to promote the
relevant values when its core practices (e.g., adjudication) are
regulated by, and its officials believe in, the Separation Thesis (see
1.1). Other theorists have contended the exact opposite&mdash;namely,
that positivist thinking has contributed to the failure of lawyers to
adequately respond to injustices perpetrated by legal orders (Radbruch
2006).</p>

<p>
The normative questions raised by the prescriptive approach are surely
significant, but needn&rsquo;t be in competition with the questions
raised by either the conceptual or the reductionist approach. It might
turn out that positivism provides the best account of a shared concept
of law, or perhaps the best reductive account of legal facts, even
though there are reasons for changing our practices or adopting a new
concept that, say, comports with natural law theory. That said, some
of the interest in prescriptive accounts likely traces to the worry
that legal theories purporting to be purely descriptive are pushing
some hidden ideological or political agenda (for more on this, see,
e.g., John Gardner&rsquo;s introduction to Dickson 2004). In fact, it
has recently been suggested that the debate between positivists and
anti-positivists is &ldquo;tacitly&rdquo; a &ldquo;meta-linguistic
negotiation&rdquo; over how to use the term &ldquo;law,&rdquo; a
debate that is fueled, ultimately, by competing commitments in
&ldquo;ethics &hellip; about how we should live and what kind of
institutions should govern our lives&rdquo; (Plunkett 2016). This is a
controversial view in part because it implies that philosophers who
expressly reject the prescriptive characterization are mired in a form
of false consciousness. But perhaps the descriptive-prescriptive
divide in legal theory is not as sharp as it might appear. We turn,
finally, to methodologies on which evaluation and prescription have an
essential role to play in descriptive legal theory.</p>

<h3><a id="ConIntLegPra">2.5 Constructive Interpretation</a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most influential argument that legal theory is inherently
evaluative proceeds from the premise that legal theory is an
interpretive endeavor in Dworkin&rsquo;s (1961) sense. Recall that
legal practitioners, on Dworkin&rsquo;s portrayal, interpret the
social practices within their system in a way that&rsquo;s guided by
both considerations of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and
&ldquo;justification&rdquo; (see 1.1). The justificatory aspect of
interpretation involves coming up with an account of legal content
that doesn&rsquo;t just broadly fit what people say and do in the
community, but that&rsquo;s morally attractive to some extent. Dworkin
maintained that philosophers should embrace the same approach to
understanding legal content. Their goal shouldn&rsquo;t be analyzing
some concept or reducing legal facts to more foundational facts.
Rather, it should be reconstructing the behavior and
self-understandings of participants within legal practice in a way
that portrays the practice in a positive light (Dworkin 1986; Perry
1995, 129&ndash;31; see also Nye 2021 and the entry on
 <a href="../law-interpretivist/">legal interpretivism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
An interesting upshot of Dworkin&rsquo;s view is that assessments of
theoretical adequacy in jurisprudence require moral evaluation, which
would seem to make legal theory an inherently evaluative project.
Deciding whether some philosopher&rsquo;s interpretation of legal
practice is &ldquo;correct&rdquo; involves taking a stand on which of
the available ways of construing the practice is morally optimal. Of
course, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require asserting that the law,
on any particular construal, is <em>good</em>&mdash;full stop. But it
does seem to require saying that some interpretations of legal
practice are in some sense morally better than others. For example,
one way in which an interpretation might be &ldquo;morally
better&rdquo; is if it portrays participants in legal practice as
well-intentioned rather than malicious. However, the precise criteria
for morally evaluating competing theories on the interpretivist
approach remain unclear.</p>

<p>
Critics of the argument from interpretation maintain that a core
premise on which it depends is unmotivated (see Dickson 2001, 105).
Why assume that understanding <em>all</em> legal
phenomena&mdash;including the content of the law, the necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of a legal system, and the
nature of legal obligation&mdash;requires interpreting legal practice?
Even if the interpretivist turns out to be right about what legal
practitioners are up to in adjudication (though even that&rsquo;s
contested; see 1.1), it wouldn&rsquo;t follow that philosophers should
embrace their assumptions, at least not without further argument. The
interpretivist might respond that there is no other interesting or
practically consequential notion of &ldquo;legal content&rdquo;
besides the practice-internal notion, but that is debatable (the law,
after all, isn&rsquo;t just what legal officials say it is). A
different response appeals to the connection between legal content and
communication. It is often argued that the content of the law depends
on the content of speech acts, and determining the content of speech
acts requires interpretation (see 1.3). However, even if understanding
the law requires interpretation of some kind or other, it does not
follow that it requires a <em>constructive</em> interpretation in
Dworkin&rsquo;s sense&mdash;i.e., attributing content or meaning to
speech acts in a way that casts speakers in a morally good light
(Marmor 2011, 127&ndash;28). And the latter claim is what proponents
of the argument from interpretation need to establish.</p>

<p>
A different argument for the importance of evaluation in legal theory
appeals to the &ldquo;internal point of view&rdquo; that legal
practitioners tend to adopt towards the law (see part 1). Taking the
internal point of view towards the law seems to involve endorsing it,
seeing it as in some sense justified or as providing reasons for
action (Shapiro 2011, 96&ndash;97; Perry 1995, 99&ndash;100). An
adequate theory of law must account for the nature of this point of
view insofar as it is essential to law, and since it involves a
positive evaluation of the law, one might infer that an adequate
theory of law must engage in evaluation. One finds versions of this
argument in, e.g., Perry (1995, 121&ndash;25) and Waldron (2001,
423&ndash;28.). But whether it succeeds remains unclear. In general,
it seems we can explain the kinds of considerations that others
endorse without endorsing those considerations ourselves. It is thus
unclear why understanding legal practitioners&rsquo; endorsement of
the law in their respective jurisdictions should require viewing their
law (or the law in general) as valuable or justified.</p>

<p>
In the end, &ldquo;methodological pluralism&rdquo; may be the most apt
characterization of the state of play in jurisprudence. As we&rsquo;ve
seen, a key dividing line concerns whether an account of law&rsquo;s
nature needs to be informed by commitments in ethics. The conceptual
and reductive approaches seem to allow that there can be purely
descriptive accounts of law&mdash;i.e., accounts that describe and
explain the nature of law without being committed to any moral or
all-things-considered evaluations of the law (or of anything else).
Meanwhile, the prescriptive and interpretive approaches question both
the value and possibility of understanding law without regard to moral
considerations. It shouldn&rsquo;t escape the reader&rsquo;s notice
that this methodological debate about the inherently normative nature
of legal theorizing mirrors one at the substantive level: the
principal point of contention in jurisprudence is whether moral and
more broadly normative facts have an essential role to play in
determining legal content, in securing the existence of a legal
system, and in explaining law&rsquo;s normativity. This is no
coincidence. One&rsquo;s substantive views about a subject likely
inform one&rsquo;s sense of the best methodology for understanding it.
Thus, e.g., interpretivists and proponents of the &ldquo;one system
view&rdquo; who conceive of legal norms as genuinely normative, or as
identical to moral norms, are more likely to insist that jurisprudence
is continuous with ethics. Despite such disagreements, the fact that
adherents of these competing traditions continue to engage
productively suggests that there are probably multiple projects worth
pursuing as part of a shared effort to understand the nature of law
and legal practice.</p>
