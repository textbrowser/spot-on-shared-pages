<div id="preamble">

<p>
Christian von Ehrenfels (b. June 20, 1859, d. September 8, 1932) was
an Austrian philosopher and psychologist from the school of Franz
Brentano. He proved himself to be a highly independent and diverse
thinker by formulating the notion of <em>Gestalt</em> qualities,
elaborating on a new theory of value, and developing new ideas in
sexual ethics and cosmology. He drew on what he learned not only from
Brentano, but also from Alexius Meinong, the Austrian economists, and
evolution theorists. Nevertheless, Ehrenfels (as he shall henceforth
be designated) was also critical of his various mentors on a number of
issues. Though he was very much a theorist, he was by no means aloof
regarding the social and cultural problems of his time. Thus he also
attempted to respond to these problems by forging new paths towards
their solutions.</p>

<h2 id="LifWor">1. Life and Work</h2>

<p>
Christian Julius Leopold Karl, Freiherr von Ehrenfels, was born in
Rodaun near Vienna. He grew up in his father&rsquo;s castle in Brunn
am Walde (see Valent 2016 for more biographical details on
Ehrenfels&rsquo; youth). Though he was the eldest son and accordingly
the rightful heir to the family estate, he decided in 1882, when he
was 23 years old, to give away his birthright to his younger brother
and to devote himself entirely to philosophy, poetry, and music. At
first Ehrenfels went to Vienna in 1877 to undertake agricultural
studies, but in the winter semester 1879/80 he enrolled at the
university where he began his studies in philosophy with Franz
Brentano, Thomas Masaryk, and the young Alexius Meinong, while also
attending lectures of Franz Exner, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Ernst Mach
(Valent 2016, 179). At the same time he also began to study
composition with Anton Bruckner. As an enthusiastic follower of
Richard Wagner he was to write librettos for Wagnerian-style music
dramas. Ehrenfels then also links his loss of Christian faith to the
start of his academic studies and the discovery of Wagner (H&ouml;fer
2017, 25). In 1882 Ehrenfels undertook a &ldquo;pilgrimage&rdquo; to
Bayreuth in order to attend the first performance of Wagner&rsquo;s
<em>Parzifal</em>. This visit triggered both the end of his uncritical
personal admiration of Wagner (though not of his art) and the insight
that his own musical abilities were inadequate, ending his lessons
with Bruckner (H&ouml;fer 2017, 26).</p>

<p>
As regards Ehrenfels&rsquo; philosophical pursuits, his interest in
Brentano&rsquo;s philosophy gave way to a receptivity to the ideas of
Meinong, the new young lecturer who had also studied with Brentano,
but who was already developing views of his own, particularly in the
theory of relations, which diverged from Brentano&rsquo;s orthodox
teachings (see Rollinger 2008). According to Ehrenfels&rsquo; later
account, Brentano&rsquo;s smooth and polished delivery did not impress
him nearly as much as Meinong&rsquo;s painstaking search for truth
(Ehrenfels in PSIV, 426&ndash;429). Alois H&ouml;fler, another student
who also preferred Meinong over Brentano (and likewise a Wagnerian),
became a close friend of Ehrenfels after first meeting him in Brunn in
1876 (Valent 2016, 178). Having started to lecture in Vienna only in
1878, Meinong was awarded a position in Graz in 1882, where Ehrenfels
followed him in the winter semester of 1884/1885, after a year of
military service. Ehrenfels wrote his dissertation on <em>Relations of
Magnitude and Numbers. A Psychological Study</em> in Graz under
Meinong&rsquo;s guidance, likely based on an extensive commentary on
Meinong&rsquo;s 1882 article &ldquo;Hume Studien II: zur
Relationstheorie&rdquo; (see Ierna 2017a, 165 and Ehrenfels 2017).
Ehrenfels returned to Vienna, where he completed his
<em>Habilitation</em> (a second thesis, in addition to the doctoral
thesis, in order to qualify for a teaching position) &ldquo;On Feeling
and Willing&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1887, in PSIII, 15&ndash;97), in which
he opposed the Brentanian doctrine concerning emotions and also laid
down the psychological foundation for his later theory of value.</p>

<p>
Despite such opposition, it must not be overlooked that
Ehrenfels&rsquo; basic orientation is unquestionably Brentanian,
insofar as he never gives up thinking that consciousness is inwardly
perceived and is directed at objects. He shares this psychological
basis for philosophy with other prominent students of Brentano, such
as Meinong, Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, Edmund Husserl, Kasimir
Twardowski, and Thomas Masaryk. In addition it should be pointed out
that, though Ehrenfels did not accept Brentano&rsquo;s own peculiar
version of theism, he shared with Brentano a concern for the more
&ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; side of things. There is, by contrast, hardly
any trace of such a concern in the thought of Meinong.</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels lectured in Vienna during the summer semesters from 1891,
while travelling in the winter semesters. In 1894 he met the young
widow Emma von Hartmann at a meeting of the <em>Academic Wagner
Society</em> and married her in the same year. In 1896 he was awarded
a position at the University of Prague (PSII, 21 ff.) where he would
become a full professor in 1899 and, despite initial misgivings,
remain until his retirement. This of course meant that he was a
colleague of Marty (in large measure an orthodox follower of
Brentano), who in fact found Ehrenfels&rsquo; non-cognitivist
orientation in value theory completely reprehensible. When Ehrenfels
supported hiring H&ouml;fler in Prague as a professor of pedagogy,
this brought him into bitter conflict with Marty, who even ascribed
&ldquo;naive egoism&rdquo; to him (D&ouml;lling 1999, 141; Valent
2016, 194; Janou&scaron;ek and Rollinger 2017, 314). Ehrenfels
maintained a close relationship with Meinong and, unlike Meinong
himself and H&ouml;fler, managed to stay on good terms with Brentano.
However much Ehrenfels drew upon ideas of Meinong or anyone else,
however, he spent his years in Prague as an independent thinker and
teacher. Both Franz Kafka, Felix Weltsch, and Max Brod were familiar
with Ehrenfels as a teacher and found him to be a rather colorful and
interesting figure (see also the quotation from Emma von
Ehrenfels&rsquo; biographic sketch in PSII, 26).</p>

<p>
As pessimism began to grow in the early twentieth century, Ehrenfels
became increasingly concerned with reviving European culture (Valent
2016, &sect; 9). According to Max Brod, Ehrenfels&rsquo;
<em>Cosmogony</em> &ldquo;was a document of this generation [the
&rdquo;Generation nevertheless&ldquo; (<em>Generation des
Trotzdem</em>)], which for the first time embodied a mood of impending
doom, tough without vanishing into fear&rdquo; (quoted from Frechette
2017, 325). It is also in this context that he developed his ideas for
reforming sexual ethics. In essence he advocated polygamy for the
superior men, in order to increase the population of people with
higher qualities. He was at the same time opposed to those who
advocated racial purity and was instead all in favor of mixed races.
He did not see Jews as a threat to the &ldquo;Aryan race&rdquo; and in
fact acknowledged their great cultural achievements (PSIII, 262),
although he did fear the &ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo; (see Ehrenfels
1908, Dickinson 2002). His proposal for a new sexual ethic in order to
enhance the European stock was, however, not well received. As the
years went on, Ehrenfels himself lost enthusiasm for it, but was
instead more concerned with developing a new religion. He did not
think that Christianity, with its demands for blind faith where reason
could no longer be effective, was viable. The new religion was to be
built upon a thoroughly scientific foundation, a rational dualistic
principle of cosmogony, which also to a large extent drew upon the
concept of <em>Gestalt</em> qualities that he had developed early in
his career. It should also be mentioned here that Ehrenfels found the
<em>Gestalt</em> concept to be fruitful in the domain of
mathematics.</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels died just one year before Adolf Hitler, who was of course
fanatical in advancing racial purity, came to power in Germany.
Ehrenfels was thus spared the agony of seeing the prospect of western
civilization becoming something diametrically opposed to his own
vision. Unlike many philosophers of the twentieth century, however, it
should be kept in mind that Ehrenfels indeed had a vision. In this
regard he was more comparable to a Leibniz or a Hume as opposed to
present-day specialists in the various fragmented domains of
philosophical inquiry. Nevertheless, much of his philosophical work
also exhibits detailed analysis and rigorous argumentation and may
well be appreciated by contemporary philosophers who do not share his
driving concerns.</p>

<h2 id="GesQua">2. <em>Gestalt</em> Qualities</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>Gestalt</em>&rdquo; is probably the best known contribution
of Ehrenfels to philosophy and psychology. As Ehrenfels himself points
out in his 1890 article &ldquo;<em>&Uuml;ber
&lsquo;Gestaltqualit&auml;ten&rsquo;</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;On
&lsquo;<em>Gestalt</em> Qualities&rsquo;&rdquo;), he was inspired by a
series of remarks in Ernst Mach&rsquo;s 1886 book <em>Beitr&auml;ge
zur Analyse der Empfindungen</em> (<em>Contributions to the Analysis
of Sensations</em>), in particular Mach&rsquo;s claim that we would be
able to sense spatial shapes and melodies (&ldquo;tone shapes&rdquo;)
directly. Mach begins by discussing the comparison of geometrical
shapes: &ldquo;In examining two figures which are alike [<em>gleiche
Gestalten</em>] but differently colored (for example, two letters of
the same size and shape, but of different colors), we recognize their
sameness of form [<em>gleiche Form</em>] at the first glance, in spite
of the difference of color-sensation.&rdquo; (Mach 1886, 43,
translation from Mach 1914, 105, the same example can be found already
in Stumpf 1883, 115, which Ehrenfels had read previously.) However,
Mach then also proceeds to apply the term <em>Gestalt</em> in a
metaphorical sense to the qualitative moments of melodies.
<em>Gestalten</em>, for Mach, appear thanks to an equality
(<em>Gleichheit</em>) in the sensations, which can be noticed
&ldquo;at a glance&rdquo;, i.e., they are given directly, not deduced
or abstracted. Mach argues that the geometrical similarity of two
whole figures would be given by the lower level equality of their
elements (lengths, angles, etc.) (Mach 1886, 47; Mach 1914, 109). In
analogy to his considerations about space, Mach also applies this
analysis to time, finding the same &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; perception
of <em>Gestalt</em> in rhythm and melody (Mach 1886, 128; Mach 1914,
285). In this way, Mach used the term <em>Gestalt</em> to indicate the
characteristics of a whole that depend on the specific configuration
of its parts. This formed one of the starting points for
Ehrenfels&rsquo; much more focused discussions of <em>Gestalten</em>
in 1890. The other starting point is of course the discussion in the
School of Brentano about parts and wholes, similarity and equality,
fusion, &ldquo;relations of relations&rdquo;, and higher order objects
in general (in various terminologies). In particular, Ehrenfels&rsquo;
teacher Alexius Meinong had dedicated a work specifically to the
theory of relations (Meinong 1882), which is also repeatedly referred
to by Ehrenfels, underscoring that relations are crucially important
to his discussion and explicitly pointing out that relations
themselves are nothing but <em>Gestalt</em> qualities (Ehrenfels 1890;
Smith 1988, 101). Moreover, Stumpf had previously likewise discussed
the case of &ldquo;the similarity of one melody to another with equal
relations of successive tones, but with different absolute tonal
pitches (where we even speak of the &rdquo;same&ldquo; melody)&rdquo;
(Stumpf 1883, 113; tr. from Stumpf 2020, 63). At the same time as
Ehrenfels, and due to more or less the same set of influences, Husserl
also had used the term <em>Gestalt</em> and <em>Gestaltmoment</em> to
indicate higher-order quasi-qualities and the unitary framework of the
whole intuition (in a lecture from January 1890, see Husserl 2005, and
in the 1891 <em>Philosophy of Arithmetic</em>, where he switches his
terminology to &ldquo;figural moment&rdquo;). The similarity of
Husserl&rsquo;s and Ehrenfels&rsquo; accounts were already noted at
the time by Hillebrand in his collective review of their works
(Hillebrand 1893, tr. in Ierna 2012). Finally, Ehrenfels himself
anticipates some of the ideas of his famous 1890 article in his 1885
dissertation, in which he discusses the similarity of relations and
concludes that through comparisons of higher order relations one can
find a &ldquo;clearly perceptible similarity in their relationships,
so that through the relation even the seemingly most incompatible can
be given unity and harmony.&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1885, 85). Despite such
anticipations and parallels in the School of Brentano (see also the
critical remarks by Zimmer in Albertazzi et al. 2001, 135 ff.), it was
Ehrenfels&rsquo; work that thematized this whole topic and brought
such diverse approaches into focus, thereby turning the psychology of
<em>Gestalten</em> into a topic in its own right and fixating the
terminology, problems, and scope of the debate about higher order
objects and relations for the years to come.</p>

<p>
It is likely that Ehrenfels&rsquo; musical interests, particularly
Wagner&rsquo;s music and the concept of
&ldquo;<em>Leitmotiv</em>&rdquo;, influenced his idea of
<em>Gestaltqualit&auml;t</em> and his choice of melodies as a main
example. Through Wagner there may be an implicit undercurrent of
German Idealism and romanticism that in Ehrenfels obtains a
(Brentanist/Meinongian) psychological formulation (H&ouml;fer 2017,
34&ndash;38).</p>

<p>
The fundamental question with which Ehrenfels begins is the following:
&ldquo;Is a melody (i) a mere sum [<em>Zusammenfassung</em>] of
elements, or (ii) something novel in relation to this sum, something
that certainly goes hand in hand with but is distinguishable from the
sum of elements?&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890, tr. Smith 1988, 83) According
to Ehrenfels, insofar as Mach spoke of <em>Gestalten</em> as objects
of sensation, he could not have considered them as &ldquo;mere sum of
elements&rdquo;, but rather as something new. Indeed, Stumpf had
formulated a similar conclusion, claiming that with fusion the simple
elements in sensation appear as parts of one greater whole: &ldquo;the
qualities are not in the least changed [&hellip; ] but a new relation
is introduced between them, which establishes a closer unity than that
between members of a mere sum&rdquo; (Stumpf 1890, 64). According to
Ehrenfels, as soon as one is committed to the idea that something
other than the sum of the tones makes up the melody, &ldquo;one has in
effect accepted what we call the tonal <em>Gestalt</em>&rdquo;
(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 91). More precisely:</p>

<blockquote>
Let us suppose, on the one hand, that the series of tones
<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>,
<em>t</em><sub>3</sub>, &hellip;, <em>t</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, on
being sounded, is apprehended by a conscious subject <em>S</em> as a
tonal <em>Gestalt</em> (so that the memory-images of all the tones are
simultaneously present to him); and let us suppose also that the sum
of these <em>n</em> tones, each with its particular temporal
determination, is brought to presentation by n unities of
consciousness in such a way that each of these <em>n</em> individuals
has in his consciousness only one single tone-presentation. Then the
question arises whether the consciousness <em>S</em>, in apprehending
the melody, brings more to his presentation than the <em>n</em>
distinct individuals taken together. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 85)
</blockquote>

<p>
Ehrenfels argues that a <em>Gestalt</em> is more (or at least other)
than the sum of its parts, which helps to explain how people can
remember melodies without having absolute pitch and in different keys,
which would be incompatible with the view of melodies as mere sums of
tones (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 90 ff.). Based on these preliminary
observations and the rejection of simplistic objections, Ehrenfels
introduces his definition of a <em>Gestalt</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
By a <em>Gestalt</em> quality we understand a positive content of
presentation bound up in consciousness with the presence of complexes
of mutually separable (i.e., independently presentable) elements. That
complex of presentations which is necessary for the existence of a
given <em>Gestalt</em> quality we call the foundation
[<em>Grundlage</em>] of that quality. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 93)
</blockquote>

<p>
Furthermore, he introduces an important distinction here: &ldquo;We
can however exhaustively partition all possible <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities into the two non-overlapping categories of temporal and
non-temporal.&rdquo; Specifically, in the case of temporal
<em>Gestalt</em> qualities &ldquo;at most one element can be given in
perceptual presentation&rdquo;, the rest being available only in
memory or anticipation, while non-temporal <em>Gestalt</em> qualities
&ldquo;are qualities whose foundation can be given completely in
perceptual presentation&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 94).</p>

<p>
Harmony and timbre would be examples of non-temporal <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities and with respect to chords, among others, Ehrenfels points
out that &ldquo;the <em>Gestalt</em> quality may sometimes force
itself into the foreground, i.e., may make demands on our attention to
such an extent that it is difficult to resolve its foundation into
elements&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 95). This shows the need
for abstraction to identify the various layers of tonal complexes, as
we find in Stumpf&rsquo;s (1883, 101) characterization of fusion of
consonant tones as &ldquo;less easily and completely recognized as a
multiplicity&rdquo;. Indeed, Ehrenfels also speaks of fusion, and like
Stumpf (1890, 65 ff., 193), even of fusion (and hence
<em>Gestalten</em>) among different senses:</p>

<blockquote>
The intimate fusion of touch, temperature and sometimes also taste and
smell sensations into a single unified total impression raises the
question of whether we do not have here <em>Gestalt</em> qualities
which are built up upon a foundation belonging to several sensory
regions. [&hellip;] we must also accept the possibility of
<em>Gestalt</em> qualities comprehending complexes of elements of
different categories. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 97)
</blockquote>

<p>
Temporal <em>Gestalt</em> qualities, on the other hand, are generated
by &ldquo;every change of any kind in a presentational complex,
providing it proceeds in some definite direction&rdquo;, specifically,
if such change &ldquo;reveals a unified character, so that we have (or
could have) a name to designate it&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988,
97 ff.), it identifies a <em>Gestalt</em> quality. While Ehrenfels
seems to focus on auditory <em>Gestalt</em> phenomena such as
melodies, temporal <em>Gestalten</em> can occur in any sensory domain
(and across sensory domains). A good example of a visual temporal
<em>Gestalt</em> would be dance (see e.g. the discussion in Cattaruzza
and Coppola 2020). However, not only change, but also persistence,
such as the sustaining of a note, can give rise to a peculiar
<em>Gestalt</em> quality (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101).</p>

<p>
Similarly to Husserl, who points to collective nouns as identifying
the figural moments that characterize <em>Inbegriffe</em> (swarm,
flock, herd, etc.), Ehrenfels also tries to find helpful indicators in
ordinary language, but cannot but lament the poverty of the available
terminology:</p>

<blockquote>
We have to make do with a few words for isolated examples from the
whole range of possible colour changes (e.g. blushing, blanching,
darkening, glowing, etc.). [&hellip;] Beside the musical temporal
qualities already considered we have to recognize also such noise or
resonance <em>Gestalten</em> as, say, thundering, exploding, rustling,
splashing, etc. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 98, 100)
</blockquote>

<p>
Ehrenfels proceeds to highlight <em>Gestalt</em> qualities in almost
every domain. First of all, relations also fall &ldquo;under the
concept of Gestalt quality&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101),
since they consist in a presentational complex of separable elements
(as in the case of the similarity relation between red and orange),
though the two categories cannot be straightforwardly be equated
(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 102). Also in the case where elements
cannot be combined, i.e., logical incompatibility (as in the case of a
round square, see Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 104 Ierna 2019), there
is nevertheless an unintuitive unity to the whole, which is again a
<em>Gestalt</em> quality: &ldquo;If I am to deny the existence of a
round square, then I must be in a position to think this round square.
i.e., to combine the two determinations roundness and squareness in
some way or other.&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 103). Moreover,
since one can form unintuitive presentations also when the elements
are compatible, Ehrenfels argues that the movement of going from an
unintuitive to the corresponding intuitive presentation gives rise to
a <em>Gestalt</em> quality.</p>

<blockquote>
Thus anyone confronted with, say, a complicated description of a work
of architecture will first of all form a merely indirect presentation
of it, which will then be rounded out by gradual execution or
fulfilment of the various merely intended components, to yield an
intuitive total picture. But this process of formation of the
intuitive presentation directly from the indirect presentation is
something that happens, a process of change, which serves as the
foundation for a specific temporal <em>Gestalt</em> quality.
(Ehrenfels 1890, tr. Smith 1988, 104)
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the <em>Gestalt</em> nature of relations, including in
particular relations of comparison, Ehrenfels argues that
<em>Gestalten</em> can themselves also be compared to one another and
hence give rise to increasingly higher order <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities. Ehrenfels suggest among other things, that temporal
<em>Gestalten</em> can be compared with respect to their rhythm or
that we can recognize the composer due to similarities in the melodies
(Ehrenfels 1890, tr. Smith 1988, 105 ff., and again also an example to
be found in Stumpf 1883, 113).</p>

<p>
Importantly, Ehrenfels also argues that temporal <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities are not limited to outer perception, but also occur in inner
perception, where the growing or diminishing of desires, fears,
expectations, etc. are compared to a crescendo or diminuendo in music
(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101). With respect to the possibility of
higher-order <em>Gestalten</em>, Ehrenfels adds to this the
&ldquo;intimate unity with which we combine presentational contents of
physical and psychical occurrences&rdquo; as in all cases of
deliberate actions &ldquo;expressed by means of common nouns
(kindness, service, rivalry, marriage, theft, war, etc.) or verbs
(entreat, complain, help, rob, avenge, etc.)&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890;.
Smith 1988, 107).</p>

<p>
If we accept any such &ldquo;union of the physical and the
psychical&rdquo; as the basis for a <em>Gestalt</em> quality, then of
course <em>Gestalten</em> are to be found everywhere: &ldquo;all
designations of human individuals or groups of whatever kind (Hans and
Paul, priests, manual workers, Scotsmen, rogues, etc.), as well as
most designations for human corporations and institutions (state,
authority, the insurance market, etc.), all names of places and
territories, and equally all names of animal species&rdquo; (Ehrenfels
1890; Smith 1988, 107). This leads straight to Ehrenfels&rsquo;
remarkable claim that &ldquo;the larger part of both our everyday and
our scientific vocabulary designates <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities&rdquo;. Not only does every verb (with the partial exception
of being and having and few others) designate a (temporal)
<em>Gestalt</em>, but also &ldquo;every noun and adjective having
reference to more than a single presentational element&rdquo;
(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 108).</p>

<p>
Yet a problem remains, namely whether <em>Gestalt</em> qualities arise
as a result of some activity on our part when confronted with the
relevant complex of elements or without any contribution of the
intellect. Mach held the latter view, that &ldquo;<em>Gestalten</em>
are objects of &lsquo;sensation&rsquo; just as soon as their
respective foundations are given to consciousness&rdquo; (Ehrenfels
1890; Smith 1988, 111). Ehrenfels points out first of all that
<em>Gestalten</em> are not always noticed (e.g. proverbially seeing
the trees but not the forest) and some effort seems to be required in
grasping a shape by filling out and complementing the <em>Gestalt</em>
suggested by the foundations, e.g. when &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the third
dimension suggested by the cues of a perspectival drawing (Ehrenfels
1890; Smith 1988, 111 ff.). While we do not actually generate the
<em>Gestalt</em> in a separate act, specifically meant to add it to
the foundation, we do expend effort in completing the required set of
presentational elements needed for the <em>Gestalt</em>, which then
arises spontaneously. This, however, does not exclude that different
<em>Gestalten</em> may supervene on the same foundations and that we
can switch between them by changing the focus of our attention. By
bringing a different complex of presentational elements into the
foreground, i.e., by varying the foundations, we can also (indirectly)
vary the <em>Gestalt</em> (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 112 ff.).</p>

<p>
Having now found <em>Gestalt</em> qualities nearly everywhere,
Ehrenfels suggests &ldquo;that the theory of <em>Gestalt</em>
qualities would perhaps be qualified to bridge the gulf between the
various sensory regions, and indeed between the various categories of
the presentable in general&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890, Smith 1988, 114),
which ultimately &ldquo;would yield the possibility of comprehending
the whole of the known world under a single mathematical
formula&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 116). Indeed, Ehrenfels
will go on to apply the concept of <em>Gestalt</em> in very disparate
fields, ranging from mathematics to cosmology, thereby also bestowing
a peculiar unity to his entire oeuvre (see Ierna 2017b).</p>

<h2 id="TheVal">3. Theory of Values</h2>

<p>
Soon after publishing his article on <em>Gestalt</em> qualities,
Ehrenfels produced a series of articles under the title
&ldquo;Werttheorie und Ethik&rdquo; (1893&ndash;1894) which were
followed by his two-volume <em>System der Werttheorie</em>
(1897&ndash;1898). The first volume in particular, entitled
<em>Allgemeine Werttheorie, Psychologie des Begehrens</em>, concerns
us in this section.</p>

<p>
According to Ehrenfels, it is most appropriate to begin a
philosophical investigation by taking into account what is indicated
by ordinary language, but it is by no means obligatory to leave the
matter there. Sometimes a revision of the concept in question is
needed and such a revision he finds indeed to be necessary regarding
the concept of value. While ordinary language seems to indicate that
the value of something is among its objective properties, such a
value-property is not to be found in reality. Rather, as long as we
adhere to such a conception of value, it seems to be mystical. The two
options Ehrenfels considers, resemble those of the Euthyphro dilemma:
do we desire things because of their value or do things have value
because we desire them? Though we ordinarily think that we desire
objects because they are &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; (i.e., because they
supposedly have this &ldquo;mystical, incomprehensible
essence&rdquo;), the fact of the matter, says Ehrenfels, is that we
ascribe value to objects because we desire them (Ehrenfels 1897, 2,
also see Fabian in Albertazzi et al. 1996, 166; Reicher 2017, 284
f.).</p>

<p>
Besides the view that value is some sort of mystical property of
objects, other ones are identified by Ehrenfels in opposition to his.
Among these views is the one put forward by the so-called &ldquo;first
school&rdquo; of Austrian value theory, as put forward by the
economists Carl Menger, Eugen B&ouml;hm von Bawerk, and Friedrich von
Wieser (as mentioned in Ehrenfels 1897, 3 n.). On this view the value
of objects &ldquo;is neither a property nor an essence of them,
considered as such, but rather merely their indispensability in the
satisfaction of our desires&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1897, 3). While
Ehrenfels fully appreciates this school&rsquo;s contribution to the
understanding of value (Smith 1994, 282), he nonetheless thinks that
it does not provide a satisfactory theory of value in general due to
its narrow focus on economic value. There are for him other types of
value besides this, as exhibited by counter-examples (as when the lock
of hair belonging to one&rsquo;s mother is kept as a thing of value).
A general theory of value on his view is to illuminate economic value
and not vice versa.</p>

<p>
Yet another attempt to characterize value without assigning it the
status of a mystical property of certain objects, is the one that had
been put forward by Brentano, which Ehrenfels formulates as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
Not all desired things are valuable, but rather only those which are
<em>worthy</em> of being desired. Whether this worthiness belongs to a
thing, however, is not in the particular case yielded from the
investigation of the objective nature of the thing, but rather from
the subjective consideration of the desire directed at the thing. From
the examination of our own mental activity in the act of desire we
discern whether this is directed at something valuable or not.
(Ehrenfels 1897, 3&ndash;4)
</blockquote>

<p>
In contemporary terms, Brentano is a cognitivist, for he maintains
that loving and hating (the acts of valuing on his view) can be
characterized as correct or incorrect (Brentano 1889): loving what is
worthy of love is correct, hating it is incorrect. The &ldquo;second
school&rdquo; of Austrian value theory, to which the early Meinong
(1894) as well as Ehrenfels belong, distanced itself from
Brentano&rsquo;s cognitivism, while building on his method of
descriptive psychology (Grassl in PSI, 5). Here we should note,
however, that Ehrenfels came to develop views in aesthetics that can
be contrasted with the non-cognitivism found in his early work. This
later development will be discussed further at the end of the present
section.</p>

<p>
An important aspect of Ehrenfels&rsquo; value theory is his view
regarding the relation of desire to feeling. He characterizes feeling
as anything that occurs on the scale that ranges from pleasure to pain
(Ehrenfels 1897, 5 ff.). Indifference is the central point in this
scale. Desire also encompasses a range of phenomena, consisting of
wishing, striving, and willing (Ehrenfels 1897, 6 ff.). There is,
according to Ehrenfels, clearly a difference between feeling and
desire, though they are also connected in a psychologically
interesting way. While Brentano seems to think that his inclusion of
feeling and desire in a single class of psychical phenomena is
supported by inner perception, Ehrenfels points out how ineffective an
appeal to inner perception is in such matters of dispute (this,
however, does not prevent Ehrenfels from making similar appeals at
crucial junctures of his value theory). Moreover, Brentano argues for
his classification of desire together with feeling by presenting us
with a range of phenomena which seem to shade off into each other,
beginning with a feeling and ending with not only a desire, but with a
full-fledged instance of willing (Brentano 1874, 308 ff.; Brentano
1995, 183 ff.). Nevertheless, Ehrenfels maintains that instances in
which there occurs feeling without desire and desire without feeling
serve to demonstrate that they do not belong together in the same
class of psychical phenomena (Ehrenfels 1897, 10 ff.). It is, in
addition, on his view desire rather than feeling that determines what
is valuable. It was Meinong who first insisted on the distinction
between feeling and desire, although he regarded feelings rather than
desires to be determinative of values (Meinong 1894, &sect;&sect;
5&ndash;6). Ehrenfels&rsquo; general theory of value thus stands in
contrast with those that were advocated by both of his mentors (also
see Reicher 2017, 285 f. and for the opposition between Brentano and
Ehrenfels on emotion and desire, see Rollinger 2021).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels also criticizes the traditional view (especially prominent
in Kantian ethics) that reason (<em>Vernunft</em>) can direct our
desires (Ehrenfels 1897, 8 ff.). On his view, reason may be used to
construct complexes of presentations, which are then set as goals by
our desires, though reason itself is unable to set these as goals.
Ehrenfels also thinks that reason can determine the means whereby a
goal is to be achieved, but this is again not the same as setting
goals. Aside from its involvement in shaping the presentations of ends
and the determination of the means to them, Ehrenfels rejects any
suggestion that reason plays any additional role in valuation.</p>

<p>
While the view that desire and not reason determines value will
suggest to many that Ehrenfels wants to assert that nothing is
valuable for each individual aside from its own pleasure, the
underlying assumption would be that one desires only one&rsquo;s own
feeling of pleasure. Our experience, however, shows us that this
assumption is false. &ldquo;In the most common circumstances of our
everyday life our desiring aims directly at certain routine external
tasks such as eating, drinking, waiting, sitting, sleeping, etc.,
without there being presented thereby the state of feeling which
corresponds to these&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1897, 27; Smith 1994, 283 ff.).
Nevertheless, obtaining what we desire does result in an increase of
pleasure relative to the state that would be experienced without the
desire being satisfied (Ehrenfels 1897, 31 ff.).</p>

<p>
Far from desire being aimed at such concrete things as feelings, it is
rather described by Ehrenfels in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>
Desiring a thing means either desiring the existence of a thing, or
possession of it, in which case the desire is directed at an
existence, though not of the thing itself, but rather of its
availability, and at the same time at a non-existence, the absence of
all disturbances which obstruct that availability. (Ehrenfels 1897,
53)
</blockquote>

<p>
We can of course have &ldquo;negative&rdquo; desires that are as such
directed at the non-existence of something. Though Ehrenfels does not
use any technical term in application to the correlate of desire, it
is understandable to suggest that he has &ldquo;states of
affairs&rdquo; (<em>Sachverhalte</em>) in mind here (Smith 1994,
286).</p>

<p>
It has been said that the theory of value that Ehrenfels developed in
his early work was non-cognitivist in his general theory of values. In
his aesthetics, however, we find a very different view regarding
values of works of art. This view is expressed in a posthumously
published dialogue, &ldquo;Was ist Sch&ouml;nheit?&rdquo;, where he
says &ldquo;that absolute beauty is given and comes about wherever we
grasp with feeling or sensation a certain lawfulness
[<em>Gesetztm&auml;&szlig;igkeit</em>] that we cannot yet comprehend
with the understanding&rdquo; (PSII, 164). There are, according to
Ehrenfels, no differences in taste in art. As regards music, for
instance, the apparent difference in taste among people is
characterized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
Most fundamentally much rather difference in the capacity for musical
perception, that is to say, the faculty of apprehension, of
imagination and memory for tonal forms [<em>Tongestalten</em>] &ndash;
furthermore difference in inner rhythm and inner gestures with which
we unconsciously accompany our speech, thoughts, and feelings &ndash;
difference in our instinctual life [<em>Triebleben</em>], even in the
formation of our senses. (PSII, 164&ndash;165.)
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, absolute beauty is the same for all of us, though our
differences in the apprehension of works of art misleads us into
thinking that beauty is merely relative, just &ldquo;a matter of
taste&rdquo;. While this development in Ehrenfels aesthetics away from
his earlier non-cognitivism has not gone unnoticed (Reicher 2006,
2009) it is a domain that he himself left open for further
investigation. It apparently calls for revision of his earlier
non-cognitivism as well as explorations of connections between the
theory of <em>Gestalt</em> qualities and aesthetics.</p>

<p>
While Ehrenfels&rsquo; early work on value theory and ethics remained
for the most part within the domain now called
&ldquo;metaethics&rdquo;, he did make an effort in his later work to
develop a theory of normative ethics. His most passionate attempt to
do so will be considered in the following section.</p>

<h2 id="SexEth">4. Sexual Ethics</h2>

<p>
While Ehrenfels&rsquo; treatise on sexual ethics of 1907 might
understandably be considered extremely controversial and sexist by
today&rsquo;s standards (consider the very similar proposal in the
black satirical comedy &ldquo;Dr. Strangelove&rdquo;), it was much
less so at the time it was written. Most of the seemingly radical
ideas and proposals were relatively popular and widespread in educated
society at the time, and the controversial nature of his article is
rather due to the original way in which Ehrenfels combines and
connects them, taking them to considerably farther reaching
conclusions (compare Dickinson 2002, 265&ndash;268). The general tenor
of this treatise was already anticipated in literary form by
Ehrenfels&rsquo; choral drama <em>Siegmar und Heliea</em> from
1898/1899 (see PSII, 28 ff.).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels aimed at a recuperation of a &ldquo;natural sexual
morality&rdquo;, which would preserve and advance the healthy
constitution of a species, as opposed to the cultural sexual morality
of his time, which would instead corrupt it (Ehrenfels 1907, 8). This
could be achieved by recognizing that reproduction, while being the
main biological function of the sexual drive, is not the only one.
Sexuality also serves selection, not in the sense of natural selection
as survival of the fittest, but selection aimed at ensuring
reproduction by the best, leading to the progressive improvement of
the species (Ehrenfels 1907, 9 ff.). This is indeed formulated along
the same lines as in the case of selective breeding of farm animals:
artificial selection to obtain desirable characteristics (also see his
previous comments on racial improvement,
&ldquo;<em>Rasseverbesserung</em>&rdquo;, in Ehrenfels 1904). This
selection is the first and foremost function of male sex drive, which
is why Ehrenfels speaks of &ldquo;virile selection&rdquo; (Ehrenfels
1907, 79, compare Dickinson 2002, 258). Since, according to Ehrenfels,
males represent the active sex, not just among humans, but &ldquo;in
the entire bisexual animal kingdom&rdquo;, and the females&rsquo; sex
drive is only operative as a response to the males&rsquo;, the male
sex drive is the biologically more important one, and hence the basis
for re-establishing the natural sexual morality.</p>

<p>
As the males&rsquo; sex drive exceeds the females&rsquo;, the males
will and should compete with one another for the possibility of
reproducing with as many females as possible (Ehrenfels 1907, 46). For
a sexually well-endowed man (&ldquo;<em>einen sexual
vollkr&auml;ftigen Mann</em>&rdquo;), it is advisable to have regular,
pleasurable intercourse with healthy women or girls (Ehrenfels 1907,
62), leading to polygyny, which is the only &ldquo;healthy natural
sexual life&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1907, 13). For Ehrenfels, this new
sexual morality would actually present a &ldquo;solution to virtually
all the major problems confronting European societies&rdquo;
(Dickinson 2002, 257) in his time. Thanks to competition and polygyny,
only the best males will reproduce and will do so in greater numbers
than in a monogamous culture, in which virile selection is absent
(Ehrenfels 1907, 11, 30) and where knights and knaves alike rule as
lords in their families. Conversely, since monandric women have more
children than polyandric ones (Ehrenfels 1907, 14), and men will only
want to care for children that they can be sure to have fathered,
females should remain monandric and even avoid serial polyandry
(Ehrenfels 1907, 12). Besides the biological reasons, another concern
for Ehrenfels is the well-being of the children in successive
marriages, i.e., serial polyandry, which would destroy the trust among
parents and children, as a stepfather and alimony would never be a
satisfactory replacement (Ehrenfels 1907, 68). </p>

<p>
According to Ehrenfels, women would remain so impressed and
overwhelmed by their first sexual experience, that not even the
hottest fires of passion will ever consume that memory, and hence they
should avoid pre-marital sex to ensure future happiness in married
life (Ehrenfels 1907, 65). On the other hand, abstinence is not
suitable for men, who should certainly have some previous experience
so as to be fully aware of their sexual duties and to avoid becoming
hypersensitive to intimate physical contact (Ehrenfels 1907, 69).
Nevertheless, the youth should abstain from sex, not just actual but
also fantasized, for moral and hygienical reasons until reaching full
sexual maturity (Ehrenfels 1907, 61). What Ehrenfels considered
&ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; sexual activities, such as masturbation and
homosexuality, should be avoided and condemned, although they can be
tolerated as long as they do not damage anyone&rsquo;s health
(Ehrenfels 1907, 56). Indeed, autoeroticism, when practiced in
moderation, does not cause any noticeable harm (Ehrenfels 1907, 61),
and both autoeroticism and homosexual relationships among females,
being the passive sex, would not be as harmful as among men, and can
hence be considered as lighter transgressions (Ehrenfels 1907,
16).</p>

<p>
Monogamy, however, is a serious danger to the well-being of society,
according to Ehrenfels. Not only does a monogamous society morally and
legally sanction (Ehrenfels 1907, 78), even &ldquo;sanctify&rdquo;
(Ehrenfels 1907, 81), female possessiveness and jealousy, by
establishing an unnatural and merely culturally justified exclusive
right on the father of her children (Ehrenfels 1907, 79), but also
thereby engenders all kinds of sexual corruption and general
degenerations. By enforcing an unnatural sexual morality, it leads to
double standards (Dickinson 2002, 259), where men are driven by their
sexuality to prostitutes, pornophilia and hyperaesthesia. Due to the
demand their appetites generate, men who buy sexual satisfaction are
complicit in the human trade and the corruption of young women who
enter into prostitution, though it would go too far to forbid
prostitution altogether (Ehrenfels 1907, 62). The natural sex drive of
men, which cannot be satisfied through monogamy, drifts into extremes,
both toward pornophilia (&ldquo;<em>die Freude am
Schweinischen</em>&rdquo;), i.e., pure sensualistic, even animalistic
stimulation, disregarding the function of reproduction, through
masturbation or in brothels (with all the risks of STDs), and in the
other direction toward incessant search for variety and exotic
eroticisms (&ldquo;<em>Flattersucht</em>&rdquo;, Ehrenfels 1907,
49).</p>

<p>
The one positive side effect of monogamy is that it has led to the
&ldquo;sublimation of sexual affects&rdquo;, as modern psychology has
it, among sexually frustrated males. Since males cannot find full
satisfaction for their sex drive in monogamous marriage, they divert
their superfluous energy into other pursuits, such as cultural
achievements of various sorts: &ldquo;accumulation of ownership and
possessions, economical and social organization, artistic and
scientific achievements, indeed in works of charity and neighborly
love&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1907, 31).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels connects these themes of gender and sexuality to larger
issues of economy, sociology and politics. For instance, while
historically the institution of monogamy enabled women (and their
children) to join the workforce as partners in the family business
(Ehrenfels 1907, 37), the changing economical situation, which favors
larger enterprises, puts monogamy at a distinct disadvantage by
limiting the opportunities for married women to work. This also
negatively affects the overall composition and growth of the
workforce, since the advanced techniques available for family planning
(Ehrenfels 1907, 42 ff.) and the rising age (especially among the
higher educated) at which couples marry and have children, leads to
lower birthrates (Ehrenfels 1907, 35 ff.). Monogamy, Ehrenfels argues,
leads to a decrease both in quality as well as the quantity of the
population (compare Dickinson 2002, 259), and hence a deficit in the
workforce that can be compensated for only through immigration
(Ehrenfels 1907, 43). This has repercussions on a global scale,
because Ehrenfels feared, as many did at the time, the competition of
other races, specifically the &ldquo;Mongolian&rdquo; or yellow race.
In particular the Chinese would be an indomitable competitor
economically, as they could sink wages by offering lower cost labor
thanks to their greater number and fertility (Ehrenfels 1907, 86 ff.).
The &ldquo;Mongol tsunami&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>Mongolenflut</em>&rdquo;)
would interrupt cultural development for centuries and for Ehrenfels
the only remedy was to adopt his newly developed sexual ethics as soon
as possible in order to increase quantity and quality of the
population. Ehrenfels regarded his reform as absolutely crucial for
humanity at large in the long term, noting that in the end also the
Mongol hordes would have to adopt it, when they would eventually face
the same problems down the road (Ehrenfels 1907, 94).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels had the opportunity to present his proposal in the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Society on December 23, 1908, where Isidor Sadger
observed not only that &ldquo;all of this seems like an adolescent
sexual fantasy&rdquo;, but more significantly that behind
Ehrenfels&rsquo; views there would seem to be a personal history,
regarding the author&rsquo;s own sexuality (cf. Dickinson 2002,
268&ndash;270). In reply to this, Ehrenfels pointed out that his
proposal had grown out of the realization that it was not necessarily
he who needed to curb his sex drive, but that the dominant morality
was a distortion of the natural one.</p>

<p>
From his correspondence with Brentano, it is clear that Ehrenfels had
begun formulating his thoughts about such topics around 1900 and
corresponded about them with Brentano for several years. The sexual
and social reforms he then proposed in numerous articles, opinion
pieces, and lectures spanning more than a decade (PSII, 30, n. 29),
were for the most part met with deafening silence (PSII, 35, 40;
Valent 2016, 193).</p>

<h2 id="PhiMat">5. Philosophy of Mathematics</h2>

<p>
Like most of Brentano&rsquo;s students, Ehrenfels also wrote various
works on the philosophy of mathematics: first of all his 1885
dissertation on &ldquo;<em>Gr&ouml;&szlig;enrelationen und Zahlen:
eine psychologische Studie</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Relations of Magnitude
and Numbers: a Psychological Study&rdquo;), then his article
&ldquo;<em>Zur Philosophie der Mathematik</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;On the
Philosophy of Mathematics&rdquo;) in 1891, the same year as
Husserl&rsquo;s <em>Philosophy of Arithmetic</em>, and finally in 1922
his booklet on <em>Das Primzahlengesetz</em> (<em>The Law of Prime
Numbers</em>). As Simons (1988, 10) observes, his early mathematical
works are representative of the Brentanian approach as it can also be
found in Husserl&rsquo;s and Stumpf&rsquo;s habilitation works.</p>

<p>
Indeed, in his (Ehrenfels 1885, Ierna 2017a) dissertation Ehrenfels
presents an account of the concept of number and the philosophy of
mathematics that is for the most part the traditional Brentanian one,
though unsurprisingly including many Meinongian elements. Ehrenfels
claims that by abstracting from all particularities of two objects and
considering them merely as the foundations of a relation of
difference, we obtain the concept of two. If we then add another
object, we need to compare and distinguish not only the first-order
relations among the foundations, but also the second-order relation of
difference among the first-order relations of difference, and so on
for every additional element. This leads to a rapid increase in
complication, as illustrated in Husserl&rsquo;s critique of such an
approach in the second chapter of the <em>Philosophy of
Arithmetic</em>. Ehrenfels likewise concludes that this process of
distinction soon leads beyond our limited presentational capacities
and requires more convenient, though indirect, ways of presenting
numbers. Hence, he argues that higher numbers can only be reached by
successive presentations of partial numbers, e.g. nine by three times
three.</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels presents an interesting account of the golden ratio
(1:1.618) as the point where the relations of similarity and
difference are in balance, i.e., two magnitudes that stand to each
other in the golden ratio are as similar as they are different.
Towards the end of the work Ehrenfels&rsquo; discussion of
higher-order relations and of comparisons of relations independently
of their foundations leads him into formulations that could be seen as
anticipating his later concept of <em>Gestalt</em> qualities.</p>

<p>
In his article on the philosophy of mathematics Ehrenfels starts with
an analysis of the presentation of number and the concepts of unity
and multiplicity. He denies an empirical basis to number
presentations: &ldquo;The presentation of number is not extracted from
external perception, but is actually inserted into it&rdquo;
(Ehrenfels 1891, 287). Ehrenfels takes relations of difference as the
foundation for the concept of multiplicity and goes on to describe the
construction of numbers through counting, by successive addition of
unities (Ehrenfels 1891, 289 ff.). Like other Brentanists, he comments
on the limits of our cognitive capacities and points out that we can
have a presentation of higher numbers only indirectly, i.e.,
symbolically (Ehrenfels 1891, 292, also see 289 where he refers to
Husserl 1887). Ehrenfels here chooses the Meinongian terminology,
speaking of indirect or founded contents (see his notes on 292 ff.),
but also follows Brentano&rsquo;s approach when remarking on the power
of signs to function as surrogates for presentations (Ehrenfels 1891,
296). He gives an extensive critique of Kant&rsquo;s famous doctrine
that &ldquo;7+5=12&rdquo; would be an example of a synthetic
proposition a priori, with a quite idiosyncratic argumentation,
stating that the a priori or a posteriori character of the sum would
depend on the possibility of a direct intuition of its elements, i.e.,
a proper presentation. If we have to externalize the process by use of
signs when the numbers exceed our cognitive capacities, then how can
we claim to be able to perform such calculations a priori? Ehrenfels
lists several examples that involve external aids, such as the use of
logarithmic tables: looking up a number on a list is hardly an
&ldquo;a priori&rdquo; cognitive act (Ehrenfels 1891, 329). The
interesting aspect of his approach is that he takes mathematics in
this way as an essentially computational science, relying on external
artifacts (&ldquo;physical aides&rdquo;) and hence as a science which
necessarily has a large a posteriori component (Ehrenfels 1891, 331).
In the second half of the article, however, Ehrenfels provides a
critique of J.S. Mill and empiricism in mathematics, along the same
lines as Stumpf had done in his habilitation work. Like Husserl and
fellow Meinong-student Konrad Zindler, he points out that in the
progress of calculation with signs one often hits on
&ldquo;unpresentable&rdquo; combinations, i.e., combinations of signs
that cannot be combined into a proper presentation (Ehrenfels 1891,
342). Yet, these &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; combinations do then lead to
correct results. (This paragraph is based in part on Ierna 2011).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels himself assigns an important biographical role to his last
major work in the philosophy of mathematics, while its actual
philosophical and mathematical significance is much more modest, as we
will see. Ehrenfels states in the preface to <em>Das
Primzahlengesetz</em> that, after a long depression following WWI, the
contemplation of the &ldquo;field of numbers and their eternal,
necessary connections&rdquo; soothed his agonized spirit
(&ldquo;<em>Weltangst</em>&rdquo;) (Ehrenfels 1922, III). In the
preface to the work he retraces the development of the core idea of
the book, describing very poetically how in April 1919 the idea
&ldquo;blossomed&rdquo; in his mind about the distribution of prime
numbers (Ehrenfels 1922, IV: &ldquo;An einem warmen Aprilvormittag
1919 ist mir &ndash; in der Sonne gelagert neben der Gruft meines
Vaters &ndash; &rdquo;der Knopf aufgegangen&ldquo; f&uuml;r das
Wesentliche der L&ouml;sung.&rdquo;) Ehrenfels himself at first took
it only as a rediscovery of already well-established mathematical
insights, but having been informed by his friend and colleague the
mathematician Gerhard Kowalewski that the matter of the distribution
of primes was far from settled, Ehrenfels tried to work out his idea
in a more systematic fashion, convinced to have hit on something new
and worthwhile.</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels&rsquo; core idea in <em>Das Primzahlengesetz</em> is to
apply the notion of <em>Gestalt</em> to number series to find the
law-like regularities in the distribution of prime numbers. Therefore
Ehrenfels decided to include the entire text of his 1890 article
&ldquo;<em>&Uuml;ber Gestaltqualit&auml;ten</em>&rdquo; in the work,
unchanged, though split into two parts. In the course of his
discussion, Ehrenfels once again goes down the familiar road of
Brentanist mathematics: a discussion of proper and symbolic
presentations of number, the limits of our presentational capacity,
proper number conceptions as based on (higher order) relations of
distinction, etc. (Ehrenfels 1922, 30 ff.) He explicitly considers the
proper number presentations as <em>Gestalt</em> qualities, and to be
precise, as presentations of &ldquo;second order&rdquo;. Collections
of numbers, which he calls <em>Zahlenfiguren</em>, would be of third
order. These number figures play a central role in, literally,
&ldquo;figuring out&rdquo; the prime numbers: by generating series of
number figures corresponding to all multiples of a base number, which
can then be combined in such a way as to filter out the primes.</p>

<p>
However, in the end the result of this procedure turns out to be quite
trivial from a mathematical perspective: &ldquo;It actually merely
leads to a simplification of the method known as the &rdquo;Sieve of
Eratosthenes&ldquo; already being practiced for more than 2000
years&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1922, 48). The method of the sieve consists in
identifying and then eliminating all divisible numbers by generating
them from multiplications of primes. If one wants to find all the
prime numbers between 0 and 100, one would proceed by striking all
multiples of two, then all multiples of three, etc. until only the
primes remain. Ehrenfels&rsquo; approach shortens the process by
avoiding repeated strikings, as would happen e.g. with 6 as multiple
of both 2 and 3 (Ehrenfels 1922, 49). As Simons (1986, 112) argues,
this is merely computationally faster than the traditional method of
the sieve of Eratosthenes (but slower than other methods, as
experimentally verified by Simons 1988, 12), but not a substantially
new algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="Cos">6. Cosmology</h2>

<p>
In his 1916 <em>Kosmogonie</em>, Ehrenfels aims at laying out the
fundamental <em>Gestalt</em> of the world as a whole. Ehrenfels wants
to elucidate the origin, development, and ultimate destiny of the
universe. On the one hand, he considers it as a <em>Kosmos</em> in the
classical sense of an ordered, harmonious whole, governed by an
ordering principle that establishes the wholeness and unity of the
world. However, Ehrenfels also acknowledges a principle of disunity
and entropy: chaos and chance. For Ehrenfels, the world as we know it
is generated through the complementary activity of these two cosmic
principles (compare PSII, 44 ff.; Valent 2016, 195; H&ouml;fer 2017,
46; Ierna 2017b, &sect;3). The process of creation and generation is
itself a <em>Gestaltic</em> one, since &ldquo;All causal powers are
Gestalting tendencies&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1916; Fabian 1990, 156).
Ehrenfels in this context discusses both biological reproduction as
well as cultural production, which both lead to higher order or
&ldquo;superimposed <em>Gestalten</em>&rdquo; (Ehrenfels 1916, 102,
136). Ehrenfels also connects this process to the theory of
evolution.</p>

<p>
This results in a religious dualism. The contraposition of chaos and
cosmos explains the presence of both good and evil, reason and chance,
etc. in the world, allowing Ehrenfels to provide a theodicy.
Nevertheless, the cosmic principles themselves cannot be
straightforwardly regarded as absolutely good or evil. Moreover,
although Ehrenfels calls the ordering principle &ldquo;God&rdquo;, it
cannot be understood as the omnipotent creator of western monotheism
(also dubbed &ldquo;solotheism&rdquo; by Ehrenfels), since neither
cosmic principle is absolute in itself. Creation can only be achieved
by both principles working together and consists in God ordering and
&ldquo;shaping&rdquo; or &ldquo;forming&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<em>Gestalten</em>&rdquo; in its verbal form) the world in
perpetual contrast with chaos. Hence, the <em>Kosmogonie</em> does not
carry the tone of a typically Christian religious work, nor is it
simply a transposition of ancient or eastern mythologies into modern
Europe. Rather, Ehrenfels had the ambition to formulate a general
framework for a (utopian) future world-spanning religion, based on a
firm scientific foundation (Ehrenfels 1916, 150, also see PSII, 52).
Indeed, Ehrenfels presents his dualism explicitly as a scientific
hypothesis to be investigated and proven, and concludes that it can in
fact explain the world as it is and can be confirmed by experience
(Ehrenfels 1916, 23, 35).</p>

<p>
In the fourth paragraph of the sixth chapter, Ehrenfels formulates six
dogmas for his new religion: 1) The world is the combined product of
the active principle of order and form
(&ldquo;<em>Gestaltung</em>&rdquo;) and the passive principle of
chaos. 2) The world has a beginning but no end. Order and form are
eternally progressing and increasing. 3) The principle of unity is
bodiless and rather &ldquo;soul-like&rdquo;. 4) The eternal progress
of the world proceeds from an eternal internal development in the
principle of unity. 5) The world is not a result of a purposeful will,
but of a blind forming (&ldquo;<em>Gestalten</em>&rdquo;). 6) We human
beings are part of the divine and hence collaborators in the divine
works.</p>

<p>
These last two points are particularly relevant, because Ehrenfels
will conclude the <em>Kosmogonie</em> with the admittedly
unsubstantiated claim that the principle of unity and order is coming
to self-awareness through the human mind and that it is in and through
human beings that its blind creative impulse can acquire a purpose
(Ehrenfels 1916, 86, 207).</p>

<p>
The mere formulation of the six dogmas, as Ehrenfels clearly states at
the end of the fourth paragraph of the sixth chapter, cannot have the
pretension to constitute without further ado a fully formed religion.
In his 1922 <em>Gedanken &uuml;ber die Religion der Zukunft</em>,
Ehrenfels then sketches in more detail what is still missing in the
<em>Kosmogonie</em>. Here, as well as in the <em>Kosmogonie</em>, he
provides a description or morphology of religion rather than a
definition (in the <em>Kosmogonie</em> he spoke of a physiognomy as
<em>Weltbeschreibung</em>). Religions in general consist of four
aspects:</p>

<ol>

<li>a <em>Weltanschauung</em>, an encompassing vision of the world
based on metaphysical assumptions, that address the &ldquo;big
questions&rdquo; of why, whence, and whereto;</li>

<li>a <em>Morallehre</em> or moral standard that tells us which
actions are good or evil, allowed or reprehensible;</li>

<li>a <em>Kultus</em>, or a system of traditional practices that allow
the faithful to relate to whichever powers of the cosmos they
acknowledge;</li>

<li>exemplary <em>Idealgestalten</em>, imaginary or historical figures
to emulate, i.e., heroes and saints.</li>
</ol>

<p>
However, Ehrenfels in this writing renounces the soul-like nature of
the divine and formulates a new theory of the &ldquo;superposition of
units of consciousness&rdquo;. Ehrenfels claims that wherever there is
a living cell, there we can speak of some form of
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;. This would hold not only for unicellular
organisms, but also for plants, animals and humans. If every living
cell of my body is somehow conscious, then also the individual cells
in my brain must be. Yet while each and every individual neuron is
conscious in itself, collectively they also constitute my unitary
consciousness as a human being. This leads Ehrenfels through analogy
to formulate the idea of &ldquo;personalities of higher order&rdquo;,
indeed a <em>Volksseele</em> would be more than a mere poetic fiction.
As support for this thesis Ehrenfels points to organic metaphors for
social processes (such as competition for limited resources) as well
as the purposeful unity displayed by bee swarms that collectively act
like a single organism. Similarly, a few years later in <em>Die
Religion der Zukunft</em>, he also states explicitly that all
intellects participate in the divine intellect (Ehrenfels 1929, in
PSIV, 286).</p>

<p>
Ehrenfels&rsquo; thoughts and writings about cosmology and religion
didn&rsquo;t remain at the level of mere academic
&ldquo;armchair&rdquo; speculations. Besides his engagement for sexual
reform and the racial question in opinion pieces and speeches, he also
actively sought to concretely establish the new religion sketched
above. Indeed, Ehrenfels went so far as to publicly appeal in an open
letter to the president of Czechoslovakia, his former fellow
Brentano-pupil Thomas Masaryk, to act as the founder of the new
religion (Ehrenfels 1929, in PSIV, 289 ff.). Although sympathetic to
his concerns, Masaryk politely rebuffed him, clearly distinguishing
between his personal religious thoughts and his public political role
(see Masaryk&rsquo;s letter to Ehrenfels in PSIV, 294 ff.).</p>

<h2 id="Leg">7. Legacy</h2>

<p>
It is likely that first and foremost what comes to mind when speaking
of Ehrenfels&rsquo; legacy, is the idea of <em>Gestalt</em>. Whatever
the inspiration by Mach or the developments in the School of Brentano,
it was Ehrenfels&rsquo; article &ldquo;<em>&Uuml;ber
Gestaltqualit&auml;ten</em>&rdquo; that shaped the ensuing debates. As
Smith (1988, 12) observes: &ldquo;The importance of Ehrenfels&rsquo;
paper rests on the fact that it contains the first concentrated
reflections on the question &lsquo;what complex perceived formations
such as spatial figures or melodies might be&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Ehrenfels&rsquo; original proposal of
&ldquo;<em>Gestaltqualit&auml;ten</em>&rdquo; still left many issues
open or unclear, which were quickly taken up in various ways by his
fellow Brentanians. Despite opposition against his terminological
choice and the development of alternative terminologies, such as
Meinong&rsquo;s &ldquo;founded contents&rdquo; (1891, 253) and
Husserl&rsquo;s &ldquo;figural moments&rdquo; (1891, 236 n. 1) or
&ldquo;moments of unity&rdquo; (1901, 230), Ehrenfels&rsquo; article
contributed significantly to fix the terminology and many of the
conceptual categories, not only in German, but also in English. Work
on <em>Gestalt</em> psychology was translated into English early on
and the term &ldquo;<em>Gestalt</em>&rdquo; was quickly taken up as
technical terminology. According to Arnheim (1961, 90), &ldquo;It has
given a name to one of the most characteristic schools of scientific
thought in our time and thereby established its existence formally. It
is responsible for the word &rdquo;Gestalt&ldquo; having acquired
citizenship in the English language&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
At variance with many other pupils of Brentano, Ehrenfels did not
establish a school or movement of his own, although he was the first
teacher of Max Wertheimer in Prague. While Ehrenfels&rsquo; work
sketched the larger picture and provided a general framework to
approach <em>Gestalt</em> phenomena, many of the details were worked
out subsequently by the Graz and Berlin schools of <em>Gestalt</em>
psychology, formed by the students of Meinong (Stephan Witasek and
Vittorio Benussi) and Stumpf (Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang
K&ouml;hler). Systematically, these schools differ mainly in their
views on how <em>Gestalt</em> qualities originate. Contra Ehrenfels,
the Graz school argued that <em>Gestalten</em> are actively produced
by our intellect on the basis of the <em>Gestalt</em> switch
phenomenon (see, among others, Smith 1994, 259 ff.). The Berlin school
instead claimed that the <em>Gestalt</em> itself is given first and
foremost in perception and that its constituents are abstracted from
it. Perceptual contents would not have a <em>Gestalt</em>, but be a
<em>Gestalt</em> (see Smith 1988, 13).</p>

<p>
The results that are regarded as Ehrenfels&rsquo; most original and
influential contributions, both the original article on
<em>Gestalt</em> as well as his engagement with value theory, were
mostly products of his early career (compare PSII, 21 ff.). The
endeavors Ehrenfels passionately pursued later on, even though
partially related to and building on his earlier work, ended for the
most part in failure. His proposals for sexual and social reforms fell
flat, the idea of establishing a new religion went nowhere, and the
discovery of the one and only law of primes turned out to be a very
minor accomplishment (cf. PSII, 53).</p>

<p>
The notion of <em>Gestalt</em>, to the contrary, obtained great
influence also beyond the school of Brentano and its offspring
(compare Zimmer in Albertazzi et al. 2001, 141 ff.). In particular,
the idea of <em>Gestalt</em> switch and a holistic interpretation of
higher-order phenomena in various contexts, has served as a metaphor
and inspiration for (among others) the idea of incommensurability of
scientific theories in Thomas Kuhn and the logical positivism of the
Vienna Circle, particularly Rudolf Carnap&rsquo;s holism, which in
turn influenced W. V. O. Quine&rsquo;s. While increasingly removed
from its original formulation, the historical starting point for it
all is Ehrenfels&rsquo; article on <em>Gestalt</em> qualities.</p>
