<h1>Feminist Philosophy of Language</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Sep 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Jul 4, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Feminist philosophy of language has come a long way in a very short
time period. Initially, most work in the area was critical, calling
for changes either to language itself or to philosophy of language.
More recently, however, the dynamic has changed, with the advent of
several major positive research programmes within philosophy of
language. In this entry, we first discuss the critiques that
constitute the first phase of feminist work in this area, before
moving onto the positive research programmes that have recently come
to the fore. Our focus in this entry will generally be on the analytic
tradition. For continental approaches, see the entries on
 <a href="../femapproach-analy-cont/">feminist approaches to the intersection of analytic and continental philosophy</a>,

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="EarWorLanPhiLan">1. Early work on language and philosophy of language</h2>

<h3 id="FalGenNeu">1.1 False gender-neutrality</h3>

<p>
One of the earliest issues that feminists writing about language
discussed was the supposedly gender-neutral use of terms like
&lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo;. It is commonly said that these
terms have both gender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2),
and gender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4).</p>

<ol>

<li id="exA1">He drank the wine.</li>

<li id="exA2">A man went into a bar.</li>

<li id="exA3">When a student comes into the room, he should pick up a
handout.</li>

<li id="exA4">Man is a primate.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Feminists, however, have pointed out that even the supposed
gender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral.
Janice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in
which there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but
this meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem
ill-formed:</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: arabic">

<li>Man has two sexes; some men are female.</li>

<li>Man breastfeeds his young.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that
&lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;he&rsquo; are gender-neutral terms. In
order to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful
work on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps the
meaning of &lsquo;he&rsquo; that has been called
&lsquo;gender-neutral&rsquo; is not really gender-neutral, but
something much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we
should understand the &lsquo;gender-neutral&rsquo; use of
&lsquo;man&rsquo; as referring to either (a) a person or persons of
unknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This
explains why &lsquo;men&rsquo; in (5) and &lsquo;man&rsquo; in (6) are
anomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons
known to be female.</p>

<p>
The supposed &lsquo;gender-neutral&rsquo; meaning of these terms,
then, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show
that there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been
classified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4).
(Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb
would not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in
question.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use
that is made of these terms.</p>

<h3 id="InvWom">1.2 Invisibility of women</h3>

<p>
Feminist concerns, however, go beyond mere classificatory ones.
Feminists have also argued that terms like &lsquo;he&rsquo; and
&lsquo;man&rsquo; contribute to making women invisible&mdash;that is,
to obscuring women&rsquo;s importance, and distracting attention from
their existence. Fighting the invisibility of women is an important
feminist project in many areas, and language that makes one less
likely to think of women clearly contributes to this invisibility.
(See, for example,
 <a href="../femapproach-analytic/">analytic feminism</a>;
 <a href="../feminism-self/">feminist perspectives on the self</a>;
 <a href="../feminism-ethics/">feminist ethics</a>;
 and
 <a href="../feminism-femhist/">feminist history of philosophy</a>.)
 There is good psycholinguistic evidence that those who encounter
sentences (like
 <a href="#exA3">(3)</a>
 and
 <a href="#exA4">(4)</a>)
 using the terms &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo; think more
readily of males than of females. (See, for example, Erlich &amp; King
1998: 168; Gastil 1990; Martyna 1978; Moulton, Robinson, &amp; Elias
1978; Wilson &amp; Ng 1988.) There have been some criticisms of this
research in Cole, Hill, &amp; Dayley 1983. But see also the response
to these criticisms in Gastil 1990. If this is right, then the use of
these words can be seen as contributing to the invisibility of women.
This gives feminists a good reason to object to the
&lsquo;gender-neutral&rsquo; use of these terms. (For more on these
issues see Cameron 1985, 2023; McConnell-Ginet 2020.)</p>

<h3 id="MalNor">1.3 Maleness as norm</h3>

<p>
If one&rsquo;s only worry concerned the obscuring of women&rsquo;s
presence, however, it would be difficult to object to certain other
terms to which feminists do commonly object: gender-specific
occupational terms like &lsquo;manageress&rsquo; (used until recent
decades in the UK) or &lsquo;lady doctor,&rsquo; sometimes called
&lsquo;feminitives&rsquo; in comparative linguistics when the
occupational term in question is designated female as with the
previous examples (see Pulijana and Stevens 2023). These terms
certainly do not contribute to the invisibility of women. Instead,
they call attention to the presence of women. Moreover, they call
attention to women&rsquo;s presence in positions of
authority&mdash;doctor and manager. Nonetheless, most feminists who
think about language find these terms objectionable. See Pulijana and
Stevens 2023 for an argument that feminitives like
&lsquo;manageress&rsquo; are both useful when it comes to the semantic
exclusion of women, and harmful insofar as they pragmatically
reinforce presuppositions about gender.</p>

<p>
The clearest reason for objecting to &lsquo;manageress&rsquo; and
&lsquo;lady doctor&rsquo; is that the use of these terms seems
premised on the idea that maleness is the norm, and that women filling
these jobs are somehow deviant versions of doctors and managers. This
is also a key objection to the use of &lsquo;he&rsquo; and
&lsquo;man&rsquo;. Moulton (1981a) understands these terms on the
model of brand names, like &lsquo;Kleenex,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Velcro,&rsquo; &lsquo;Hoover&rsquo; (UK) or &lsquo;Scotch
tape&rsquo; that become generic terms for a product type. The message
of such terms, she suggests, is that the brand in question is the
best, or at least the norm. According to Moulton, terms like
&lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo; work in the same manner: they
are gender-specific terms for men whose use has been extended to cover
both men and women. This, Moulton argues, carries the message that
maleness is the norm. As a result, the use of these terms as if they
were gender neutral constitutes a sort of symbolic insult to women.
Laurence Horn and Steven R. Kleinedler (2000) have disputed the
details of this, noting that &lsquo;man&rsquo; did not begin its life
as gender-specific and then get extended to cover both women and men.
Rather, &lsquo;man&rsquo; actually began its life as
&lsquo;mann&rsquo;, a gender-neutral term, which only later acquired a
gender-specific meaning. The temporal sequence, then, cannot support
the claim that a gender-specific term has been extended to cover both
genders. Nonetheless, Horn and Kleinedler agree that the use of terms
like &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo; as if they were
gender-neutral perpetuates the objectionable idea that men are the
norm for humanity. (For a recent discussion of this, see
McConnell-Ginet 2020.)</p>

<h3 id="SexMar">1.4 Sex-marking</h3>

<p>
English, like most&mdash;but not all&mdash;languages, requires a great
deal of what Marilyn Frye calls &lsquo;sex marking&rsquo; (Frye 1983).
For example, one cannot use pronouns to refer to a particular
individual without knowing their sex. (Frye, in common with most
feminists of the early 1980s, does not consider trans issues. She also
does not consider the possibility that pronouns like &lsquo;he&rsquo;
and &lsquo;she&rsquo; might be a matter of gender, not sex.) Frye
notes the absurdity of this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If I am writing a book review, the use of personal pronouns to refer
to the author creates the need to know whether that person&rsquo;s
reproductive cells are the sort which produce ova or the sort which
produce sperm. (Frye 1983: 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Singular personal pronoun usage, Frye argues, is impossible without
knowing the sex of the person one is discussing, and in many cases sex
would otherwise be utterly irrelevant. Frye takes this to be an
instance of a general tendency to make sex relevant where it need not
be, which she takes to be a key feature of sexism. In addition, she
suggests, the constant need to know and indicate sex helps to
perpetuate the conviction that sex is a tremendously important matter
in all areas. For Frye, this is a key factor in perpetuating male
dominance: male dominance requires the belief that men and women are
importantly different from each other, so anything that contributes to
the impression that sex differences are important is therefore a
contributor to male dominance. In more recent literature, the concerns
stemming from this earlier work are taken up by the literature on
gender marking, discussed in 2.1.</p>

<h3 id="MalLan">1.5 Maleness of Language</h3>

<p>
Some feminists (e.g., Penelope 1990; Spender 1985) argue that English
is, in some quite general sense, male. (Corresponding arguments are
also put forward about other languages. See, for example, Irigaray
1989/1978.) One thing that is meant by this is that English can be
said to be male in a manner similar to that in which particular terms
can be said to be male&mdash;by encoding a male worldview, by helping
to subordinate women or to render them invisible, or by taking males
as the norm. One sort of argument for this begins from the examination
of large quantities of specific terms, and the identification of
patterns of male bias, and proceeds from this to the conclusion that
the male bias of English is so widespread that it is a mistake to
locate the problem in a collection of words, rather than in the
language as a whole. The first stage of this sort of argument is,
obviously, a lengthy and complex one. The sorts of claims cited (in
addition to those we have already seen) include (a) that there are
more words for males than for females in English, and that more of
these words are positive (Spender 1985: 15, citing Julia Stanley
1977); (b) that a &ldquo;word for women assume[s] negative
connotations even where it designated the same state or condition as
it did for men&rdquo; (Spender 1985: 17), as with
&lsquo;spinster&rsquo; and &lsquo;bachelor&rsquo;; (c) that words for
women are far more frequently sexualized than words for men, and that
this holds true even for neutral words, when they are applied to
women. Dale Spender, citing Lakoff (1975), discusses the example of
&lsquo;professional&rsquo;, comparing &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a
professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a professional&rsquo;, and
noting that the latter is far more likely than the former to be taken
to mean that the person in question is a sex worker. The sexualisation
of words for women is considered especially significant by the many
feminists who take sexual objectification to be a crucial element, if
not the root, of inequalities between women and men. (For more on such
examples, see also Baker 1975.)</p>

<p>
This widespread encoding of male bias in language is, according to
theorists like Spender, just what we should expect. Males (though not,
as she notes, all of them) have had far more power in society, and
this, she claims has included the power to enforce their view of the
world through language. Moreover, she argues, this has served to
enhance their power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There <em>is</em> sexism in language, it <em>does</em> enhance the
position of males, and males <em>have</em> had control over the
production of cultural forms. (Spender 1985: 144)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This, Spender claims, provides circumstantial evidence that
&ldquo;males have encoded sexism into language to consolidate their
claims of male supremacy&rdquo; (Spender 1985: 144). Spender takes the
evidence for this claim to be far more than circumstantial, however,
and to support it she discusses the efforts of prescriptive
grammarians. These include, for example, the claim that males should
be listed before females because &ldquo;the male gender was the
<em>worthier</em> gender&rdquo; (Spender 1985: 147, emphasis hers),
and the efforts (noted earlier) to establish &lsquo;he&rsquo; as the
gender-neutral third-person English pronoun.</p>

<p>
According to theorists like Spender, men&rsquo;s ability to control
language gives them great power indeed. We have already seen ways in
which what one might call the maleness of language contributes to the
invisibility of women (with respect to words like &lsquo;he&rsquo; and
&lsquo;man&rsquo;). If one takes the maleness of language to go beyond
a few specific terms, one will take language&rsquo;s power to make
women invisible to be even stronger. We have also seen ways that what
might be called maleness can make it more difficult for women to
express themselves. Where we lack words for important female
experiences, like sexual harassment, women will find it more difficult
to describe key elements of their existence. Similarly, where the
words we have&mdash;like &lsquo;foreplay&rsquo;&mdash;systematically
distort women&rsquo;s experiences, women will have a difficult time
accurately conveying the realities of their lives. If one takes such
problems to go beyond selected particular terms, and to infect
language as a whole, it is natural to suppose that women are to a
large degree silenced&mdash;unable to accurately articulate key
elements of their lives, and unable to communicate important aspects
of their thoughts.Spender and others also suggest that the maleness of
language constrains <em>thought</em>, imposing a male worldview on all
of us, and making alternative visions of reality impossible, or at
least very difficult to articulate. These arguments often draw upon
the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir 1921; Whorf 1956). It is
generally formulated very vaguely, but seems to amount to roughly the
hypothesis that &ldquo;our worldview is determined by the structures
of the particular language that we happen to speak&rdquo; (Cameron
1998b: 150). (There is substantial controversy about what this means,
and about the accuracy of attributing it to either Sapir or Whorf, but
this controversy is not very relevant to the present entry.)</p>

<p>
Some suggest that male power over language allows men to shape not
just thought, but also reality. For example, Spender claims that men
&ldquo;created language, thought, and reality&rdquo; (1985: 143). This
is a very strong version of what Haslanger has called <em>discursive
constructivism</em>. For more on discursive constructivism, see also
the section on Feminist Postmodernism in the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>.
 She defines this view as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Something is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it
is, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or
self-attributed) to it. (Haslanger 1995: 99)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Feminists like Spender and Catherine MacKinnon (1989) argue that male
power over language has allowed them to create reality. This is partly
due to the fact that our categorizations of reality inevitably depend
on our social perspective: &ldquo;there is no ungendered reality or
ungendered perspective&rdquo; (MacKinnon 1989: 114). Haslanger (1995)
discusses this argument in detail.</p>

<p>
In general, the solution suggested is not to attempt to create a
neutral language. Instead, we must aim to create a new reality more
congenial to women. Some feminists have argued that the only way to
achieve this is for women to create their own language, either by
redefining terms already in use, or by inventing a new language, with
new words and new rules. Only in this way, they suggest, will women be
able to break free from the constraints of male language and male
thought, to articulate a competing vision for the world, and to work
toward it (Daly and Caputi 1987; Elgin 1985; MacKinnon 1989; Penelope
1990; Spender 1985). Lynne Tirrell (1993) offers an especially
sophisticated and complex discussion of this idea. She does this by
introducing a notion of &lsquo;semantic authority&rsquo; and using it
to argue for a kind of separatism that would allow women to recreate
and redefine a world that had previously been defined for them by men.
Tirrell argues that definition and redefinition, which are sources of
semantic authority, happen in community: through the creation of
community, community recognition of authority and value, and
authorship of oneself as a member of a community that supports and
recognizes that self-authorship (p.10). Separatist communities also
provide frameworks that allow for self-articulation and uptake: they
allow, for example, a &ldquo;community-supported interpretation&rdquo;
of a woman&rsquo;s articulation of her own marital rape, in contrast
to a patriarchal legal and social system that denies this
self-articulation by making marital rape &ldquo;an oxymoron&rdquo;
(p.14). Separatist communities thus grant semantic authority and
provide linguistic frameworks that allow women to self-articulate, and
define and create themselves in a way that oppressive
&ldquo;phallocratic&rdquo; communities do not allow for (p. 14).</p>

<p>
The claims discussed above concerning the maleness of English, its
causes, and its effects, are far from uncontentious. First, the extent
of male bias in language is debatable. Although it is right that there
is much to worry feminists about a wide variety of specific terms and
usages, it is far from clear that it is appropriate to claim that
English is male-biased in some sweeping sense. It is also unclear
exactly what the claim being made is. If this claim is taken to be
that every term is male-biased, then it is highly implausible: it is
very unlikely that there is a male bias present in &lsquo;piano&rsquo;
or &lsquo;isotope&rsquo;. If the claim is simply that there is much
for feminists to object to, then it is almost certainly
right&mdash;but it is far from obvious that it is useful to focus on
such a general claim rather than on specific problems, their
complexities and their possible solutions (Cameron 1998b).</p>

<p>
Next, the power that men have undeniably exercised in society (though,
importantly, some groups of men have been vastly less powerful than
others) by no means translates to a general power over language.
Language is a difficult thing to control, as those who have attempted
to create languages have learned. The main power men have had has
concerned dictionaries, usage guides, and laws. While these are
enormously important in shaping reality, and in shaping our thoughts,
it is quite a leap to move from this power to the claim that men
&lsquo;created language, thought, and reality&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
The claimed effects of the maleness of language are also problematic.
We have already seen problems for the idea that men control language.
The idea that men also control or create thought and reality faces
further problems. The ability of feminists to successfully point out
ways in which elements of language have obscured women&rsquo;s
experiences counts strongly against the claim that men control thought
(Cameron 1998b); and, as Haslanger (1995) has argued in detail,
discursive constructivism about reality is unsustainable. Nonetheless,
it does seem right to notice that problems with specific terms can
render it more difficult for women to communicate about important
elements of their lives, and probably also more difficult to reflect
upon these elements (Hornsby 1995). These difficulties could perhaps
be described as partial silencing, partial constraint of thought, or
hermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007). (We discuss silencing and
hermeneutical injustice in more detail in Section 2.)</p>

<p>
If the criticisms above are right, then women certainly do not need to
create their own language. Many welcome this conclusion, worried that
a women&rsquo;s language would doom women&rsquo;s thoughts to
marginality and impede feminist progress. Moreover, the idea that
women could craft a common language that allowed the articulation of
all their experiences seems to ignore the fact that women differ
enormously from one another (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones and Spelman 1983;
Spelman 1988; see the section on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-philosophy/index.html#FemiDiveWome">feminism and the diversity of women</a>
 in the entry on
 <a href="../feminist-philosophy/">feminist philosophy</a>).
 If women cannot use the same language as men, why should we suppose
that women can successfully share a language?</p>

<p>
The idea that some terms encode a male worldview, however, has
considerably more appeal than the idea that language <em>as a
whole</em> is male. One thing that is meant by it is, roughly, that
the meanings of certain terms seem to divide the world up in a way
that is more natural for men than for women. Good examples of this
come from the terms &lsquo;foreplay&rsquo; and &lsquo;sex&rsquo;.
&lsquo;Sex&rsquo; is generally taken to refer to an act that is
defined in terms of male orgasm, while the sexual activities during
which many women have their orgasms are relegated to secondary status,
referred to by terms like &lsquo;foreplay&rsquo;. These terms, then,
can be seen as based in a male perspective on sex. (It is worth noting
that the &lsquo;male perspective&rsquo; claim need not rest on the
(implausible) idea that this perspective is shared by all men. Rather,
it can rest on claims about what is typical for men, or on the claim
that the only perspective from which certain understandings make sense
is a male one.) As a result, these terms may serve as a barrier to
accurate communication or even thought about women&rsquo;s experiences
of sex (Cameron 1985; Moulton 1981b; Spender 1980 [1985]). Catharine
MacKinnon and Sally Haslanger also discuss legal definitions of
&lsquo;rape&rsquo; as (among other things) involving more than
&lsquo;the normal level of force&rsquo;, an understanding that seems
committed to the idea that some level of force is acceptable in sexual
relations (Haslanger 1995: 109; MacKinnon 1989: 173).</p>

<p>
Languages may also lack words for things that matter a great deal to
women. This sort of gap is another way that a language can be seen as
encoding a male worldview. The term &lsquo;sexual harassment&rsquo;,
for example, is a recent feminist innovation. Women&rsquo;s discussion
of their experiences led them to see a certain common element to many
of their problems, and as a result they invented the term
&lsquo;sexual harassment&rsquo;. Once the problem was named, it became
much easier to fight sexual harassment, both legally and by educating
people about it (Farley 1978; Spender 1985).</p>

<p>
Miranda Fricker (2007) calls gaps such as that before the invention of
the term &lsquo;sexual harassment&rsquo; a form of hermeneutical
injustice. Roughly speaking, this is what occurs when &ldquo;some
significant area of one&rsquo;s social experience [is] obscured from
collective understanding owing to&rdquo; (2007: 155) a gap in communal
linguistic/conceptual resources that is more damaging to those from a
socially disadvantaged group (to which one belongs). In her
<em>Epistemic Injustice</em>, Fricker connects this up with issues in
both ethics and epistemology, especially epistemology of testimony. We
discuss this more fully in 2.5, below.</p>

<h3 id="Met">1.6 Metaphor</h3>

<p>
Feminists have also devoted attention to another aspect of
language&mdash;the use of metaphor (see the section Feminist Critiques
and Conceptions of Objectivity in the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>;
 and the entry on
 <a href="../femapproach-prag-cont/">feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy</a>).
 In particular, feminists have discussed the use of gendered metaphors
in philosophy and in science. Emily Martin (1991 [1996]) offers
particularly vivid examples in her discussion of the use of gendered
metaphors in discussions of human reproduction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
At its extreme, the age-old relationship of the egg and the sperm
takes on a royal or religious patina. The egg coat, its protective
barrier, is sometimes called its &lsquo;vestments&rsquo;, a term
usually reserved for sacred, religious dress. The egg is said to have
a &lsquo;corona&rsquo;, a crown, and to be accompanied by
&lsquo;attendant cells&rsquo;. It is holy, set apart and above, the
queen to the sperm&rsquo;s king. The egg is also passive, which means
it must depend on the sperm for rescue. Gerald Schatten and Helen
Schatten liken the egg&rsquo;s role to that of Sleeping Beauty:
&lsquo;a dormant bride awaiting her mate&rsquo;s magic kiss, which
instills the spirit that brings her to life&rsquo;. Sperm, by
contrast, have a &lsquo;mission&rsquo; which is to &lsquo;move through
the female genital tract in quest of the ovum&rsquo;. One popular
account has it that the sperm carry out a &lsquo;perilous
journey&rsquo; into the &lsquo;warm darkness&rsquo;, where some fall
away &lsquo;exhausted&rsquo;. &lsquo;Survivors&rsquo;
&lsquo;assault&rsquo; the egg, the successful candidates
&lsquo;surrounding the prize&rsquo;&hellip; (Martin 1996: 106)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The vision of reproduction suggested above is an inaccurate one. The
sperm fails to behave in the single-minded manner suggested. Instead,
the</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
sideways motion of the sperm&rsquo;s tail makes the head move sideways
with a force that is ten times stronger than its forward
movement&hellip;in fact, its strongest tendency, by tenfold, is to
escape by attempting to pry itself off the egg. (Martin 1996: 108)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nor is the egg passive: adhesive molecules on its surface play a
crucial role in overcoming the sperm&rsquo;s tendency to pry itself
away (Martin 1996: 108). Martin argues that scientists have been slow
to discover these facts, partly due to the metaphors they employed;
and that even as they have learned these facts they have been slow to
update their metaphors. Gendered stereotypes, Martin suggests, can
impair our understanding of reproduction&mdash;by leading scientists
to employ misleading metaphors that conceal the truth. The use of
gendered stereotypes in scientific imagery can also help to perpetuate
damaging stereotypes, for example by reinforcing the tendency to see
females as passive. Martin&rsquo;s account has, however, been
challenged by Paul Gross (1998), who argues that scientists were not
nearly so slow to these discoveries as Martin claimed. If Gross is
right, then the problematic metaphors did not affect scientists&rsquo;
work in the ways suggested by Martin (though they do seem to have
affected popular writing on the subject.)</p>

<p>
Gendered metaphors have been used at many levels of discussion,
including the most general. An important topic of feminist concern has
been the historical tendency to conceive of the scientific endeavour
in gendered ways. A particularly clear example comes from Francis
Bacon, discussed by both Evelyn Fox Keller and Genevieve Lloyd:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For Bacon, the promise of science is expressed as &lsquo;leading you
to Nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make
her your slave&rsquo;. (Keller 1996: 36.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The tendency to describe nature in feminine terms is a long-standing
and widespread one, well-documented in Lloyd (1984). Lloyd links this
to a tendency to describe reason and the mind as male, and to contrast
these with supposedly feminine emotions and bodies. She argues that
these metaphors play a powerful role in the history of philosophy,
shaping and often distorting our views both of reason, mind, emotion,
and body and of men and women. Other important discussions of gendered
metaphors in philosophy include Irigaray (1974 [1985a], 1977 [1985b]),
Le D&oelig;uff (1980 [1990]), and Nye (1990, 1992).</p>

<h3 id="PhiLan">1.7 Philosophy of Language</h3>

<p>
In the early days of feminist philosophy of language, much attention
was devoted to ways that philosophy of language was problematic from a
feminist point of view. One sort of criticism was that philosophy of
language, like English, displays a male bias. Another was simply that
philosophy of language is ill-equipped to further feminist aims. Those
making these criticisms did not suggest that philosophy of language be
abandoned, but rather that it should be reformed&mdash;purged of male
bias and turned into a discipline that can help in the attainment of
feminist ends.</p>

<p>
What reasons were given for supposing that philosophy of language is
ill suited to achieving feminist ends? There were a variety of reasons
(Hintikka and Hintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000; Nye 1996, 1998), but one
common thread involves the idea that philosophy of language is
excessively individualistic. Criticism of individualism in philosophy
is widespread in many areas of feminism. Exactly what
&lsquo;individualism&rsquo; comes to varies depending upon the area of
philosophy under discussion, and depending also on the concerns of the
particular critic. (For more on what feminists mean by
&lsquo;individualism&rsquo;, see Antony 1995.) Because of this, we
will not attempt a general definition of &lsquo;individualism&rsquo;,
as used by those raising these concerns. However, we will sketch what
seems to be at issue in concerns over philosophy of language. Some
claim that philosophy of language focuses excessively on the states of
mind of individual speakers&mdash;in particular on their intentions
(Hornsby 2000). Jennifer Hornsby&rsquo;s central example of this
tendency is the work of H. P. Grice, which does indeed analyse speaker
meaning in terms of speaker intentions. (Although it is worth noting
that Grice&rsquo;s analysis of sentence meaning incorporates social
elements, and that both speaker and audience are essential to his
notion of conversational implicature. For more on this, see Saul
2002.) Others suggest that semantics assigns too important a role to
the notion of reference to discrete individuals (Hintikka and Hintikka
1983). Their focus is on Alfred Tarski&rsquo;s truth definitions
(Tarski 1956; see also entry on
 <a href="../tarski-truth/">Tarski&rsquo;s truth definitions</a>)
 and Richard Montague&rsquo;s work (Thomason 1974).</p>

<p>
Individualism of this sort was said to be problematic for several
reasons. One common claim was that this sort of individualism is
characteristic of male thinking. Men tend, according to this line of
thought, to be interested in separate, discrete individuals; while
women are interested in connections and relationships. Thus, it is
suggested, an individualistic philosophy of language is one that
represents a male way of thinking about the world. For philosophy of
language to be true to the experiences and language use of both men
and women, then, the individualistic philosophy of language which is
characteristic of male thinking will need to be supplemented or
replaced by a version more suited to female thinking (Hintikka and
Hintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000). As Haslanger (2000a) and others have
noted, however, the claims regarding male and female thinking on which
this line of thought depends are not well supported. Moreover,
differences among women give us reason to doubt the prospects for any
supportable generalizations about &lsquo;women&rsquo;s&rsquo; thinking
(Ang 1995, Lorde 1983, Lugones and Spelman 1983; Moody-Adams
1991).</p>

<p>
Other objections to individualism do not depend upon contentious
psychological claims about differences between women and men. Instead,
they suggest that the real problem with individualism is its failure
to appreciate the importance of the social. The social world is,
naturally, an important area of concern when discussing politics and
power relations. Understanding how people come to dominate one
another, and exactly how this domination functions, are important
projects for feminists. Language is an important part of the social
world, and understanding the roles that language plays in
communicating, manipulating, and controlling (to cite just a few
examples) is surely vital to understanding the workings of power (see,
for example, MacKinnon&rsquo;s views on speech in MacKinnon 1993). So,
many feminists suggest, a philosophy of language that is appropriate
to understanding communicative interactions in the social world could
be a valuable tool for feminists. However, they insist that the
individualism of philosophy of language (as it is now) prevents it
from serving this function (Hornsby 2000).</p>

<p>
The general charge that philosophy of language pays little attention
to the social world is not one that all feminists would agree with.
Indeed, it is a difficult one to sustain in light of the prominence
of&mdash;to give a few examples&mdash;Saul Kripke&rsquo;s causal
theory of reference (1972; see also Section 2 of the entry on
 <a href="../reference/">reference</a>),
 Hilary Putnam&rsquo;s arguments for a social element (the division of
linguistic labor) in the working of kind terms (1975; see also Section
3 of the entry on
 <a href="../reference/">reference</a>),
 H.P. Grice&rsquo;s theory of conversation (1975 [1989]), David
Lewis&rsquo;s work on convention (1969), and J.L. Austin&rsquo;s
speech act theory (1962 [1975]). Nonetheless, one might well suggest
that philosophers of language have generally attended only to aspects
of the social world that are not of particular interest to feminists.
While causal theories of reference undeniably involve social elements,
these social elements don&rsquo;t seem to be of the sort that concern
feminists; while Putnam&rsquo;s division of linguistic labour arguably
involves some power relations (experts have a special sort of
linguistic power that non-experts lack), the political aspects of
these power relations have until very recently been ignored. (The rise
of social and political philosophy of language represents an important
departure from more traditional work.) Andrea Nye criticized
mainstream philosophy of language on roughly these grounds, arguing
that work on radical translation had not been sufficiently sensitive
to political concerns (for the notion of radical translation, see the
section on Meaning and Truth in the entry on
 <a href="../davidson/">Donald Davidson</a>).</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;a highly technical and professionalized English-speaking
philosophy of language was addressing problems of the possibility of
&lsquo;radical&rsquo; translation from one language community to
another, of alternate and incommensurable conceptual schemes, of the
difficulty of establishing singular reference across &lsquo;different
worlds&rsquo;, but with virtually no reference to actual failures of
communication or problems of gender. (Nye 1998: 266)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In response, Louise Antony has argued that it is a mistake to suppose
that there is any particular approach to philosophy of language that
is distinctly feminist or anti-feminist, taking as her particular
target Hornsby&rsquo;s work&mdash;but her arguments apply more
broadly. She argues that such strategies are &ldquo;disrespectful to
and exclusionary of feminists who support alternative views&rdquo;
(2012: 277).</p>

<h2 id="RecWor">2. More Recent Work</h2>

<p>
Things have changed a great deal in recent years, and it is now widely
accepted that philosophy of language has something to offer feminists,
and even (though less widely) that feminists have something to offer
philosophy of language. Feminist philosophy of language is now
becoming a well-established area of the larger field, with several
substantial positive research programmes. The first of these, the
reformation of language with feminist goals in mind, began in the
early days of the field. But we include it here because it is very
much a live programme today.</p>

<h3 id="RefEffSucLim">2.1 Reform Efforts: Successes and Limitations</h3>

<p>
The &ldquo;maleness of language&rdquo; issues discussed in Part 1 gave
rise to a wide variety of reform proposals (see, for example, Miller
and Swift 1976, 1980, and the papers in part two of Cameron
1998a).</p>

<p>
One especially successful reform effort has been the increasingly
accepted singular use of the third-person gender-neutral pronoun
&lsquo;they&rsquo; (in place of &lsquo;he&rsquo;) as in the sentence
below:</p>

<blockquote>
Somebody left their hat behind.
</blockquote>

<p>
A key reason for the success of this reform is perhaps the history of
the singular &lsquo;they&rsquo;. As Ann Bodine has noted (1975
[1998]), the singular use of &lsquo;they&rsquo; has a long history. It
did not begin to be criticized until the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and
despite all the efforts of prescriptive grammarians it has remained
very popular in speech. (See also Srinivasan 2020.) Due to feminist
work on the effects of &ldquo;gender-neutral&rdquo; use of
&lsquo;he&rsquo;, even prescriptive grammarians are now becoming more
accepting of &lsquo;they&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
It is also becoming increasingly widespread to use &lsquo;they&rsquo;
as one&rsquo;s chosen personal pronoun, or, less frequently, to use
another gender-neutral option such as &lsquo;ze&rsquo; (Bennett 2016;
Dembroff and Wodak 2017). This means it is now also increasingly
common to see sentences like the following, with a specific antecedent
for the third person singular pronoun.</p>

<blockquote>
Matt left their hat behind.
</blockquote>

<p>
Arguments for adopting widespread gender-neutral pronouns came from
trans activists like Leslie Feinberg (1996), who offers
&ldquo;s/he,&rdquo; &ldquo;sie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ze&rdquo; as
gender-neutral pronoun options, and ultimately advocating for
&ldquo;ze&rdquo; over &ldquo;s/he,&rdquo; explaining: &ldquo;I asked
Beacon Press to use <em>s/he</em> in the author description of me on
the cover of <em>Transgender Warriors</em>. That pronoun is a
contribution from the women&rsquo;s liberation movement. Prior to that
struggle, the pronoun &rdquo;he&ldquo; was almost universally used to
describe humankind &ndash; &rdquo;mankind&ldquo; So <em>s/he</em>
opened up the pronoun to include &rdquo;womankind.&ldquo; I used
<em>s/he</em> on my book jacket because it is recognizable as a
gender-neutral pronoun to people. But I personally prefer the pronoun
<em>ze</em> because for me, it melds mankind and womankind into
humankind&rdquo; (1994, p. 71).</p>

<p>
Dembroff and Wodak (2017, 2021) provide further arguments for the
widespread use of gender-neutral &lsquo;they,&rsquo; including
arguments for trans-inclusivity as well as arguments pointing out the
arbitrariness of linguistic identity markers. Indeed, they argue that
it would be best to adopt these for everyone (with very few
exceptions), not just for people who prefer to be referred to this
way. Kukla and Lance (2023) argue that gender ascriptions (including
but not limited to gendered pronouns) function as <em>exercitives</em>
that &ldquo;institute social norms for how people should be
treated&rdquo; (p. 1131). Hernandez &amp; Crowley (2024) argue against
Dembroff &amp; Wodak&rsquo;s prescription against gendered pronouns,
arguing that gendered pronouns and gendered language more broadly can
be a way of &ldquo;transing language&rdquo; (p.298). They offer three
kinds of language use&mdash;recognition, playful, and
joyous&mdash;that are gender affirming through the use of gendered
language.  Following Hernandez (2021), they argue that removing gender
from language is not the only way to combat gender essentialism.
Gonz&aacute;lez V&aacute;zquez, Klieber, and Rosola (2024) look beyond
English and investigate how both gender visibility and gender
neutrality are expressed in Spanish, Italian, and German. They
conclude that there is no fixed answer to how to represent genderqueer
individuals in language, but highlight the diversity between different
approaches in grammar and morphology: splitting, article splitting,
gendering, slash, and generic feminism.</p>

<p>
Other reform efforts have met with greater difficulties. Even ones
that have caught sometimes backfire. Susan Erlich and Ruth King (1992
[1998]), for example, discuss the case of &lsquo;chairperson&rsquo;,
intended to serve as a gender-neutral replacement for
&lsquo;chairman&rsquo;. Instead, they found that in many places it was
often used to indicate women who fill the post of chair, while men are
referred to as &lsquo;chairman&rsquo;. They take this to show that
reforms cannot succeed unless attitudes change as well. Since the time
of their writing, the word &lsquo;chair&rsquo; does seem to have taken
off as a truly neutral replacement for &lsquo;chairman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
Moreover, feminist work on language has also indicated that there may
be problems which are simply not amenable to piecemeal linguistic
reforms. Some difficulties that have been raised go well beyond a
handful of problematic terms or gaps. Deborah Cameron offers striking
examples of writing that take males as the norm without using any
particular terms to which one might object, such as the following,
from <em>The Sunday Times</em>:</p>

<p>
The lack of vitality is aggravated by the fact that there are so few
able-bodied young adults about. They have all gone off to work or look
for work, leaving behind the old, the disabled, the women and the
children. (Cameron 1985: 85)</p>

<p>
Clearly, in the above example, &lsquo;able-bodied young adult&rsquo;
is being used in such a way as to exclude women. Moreover, examples
like this (and others Cameron provides) pass unnoticed by newspaper
editors and many readers. There is clearly a problem, but it is not a
problem that can be pinpointed by picking out some particular term as
objectionable and in need of reform. Eliminating language use that
takes males as the norm, then, must involve more than changing a few
terms or usage rules.</p>

<h3 id="FemSpeActThe">2.2 Feminism and Speech Act Theory</h3>

<p>
A very important analytic research programme in feminist philosophy of
language began with Rae Langton&rsquo;s and Hornsby&rsquo;s use of
speech act theory to make sense of Catharine MacKinnon&rsquo;s
suggestion that pornography silences and subordinates women. It has
now, however, evolved well beyond those beginnings. To give some
flavour of this initial work, we briefly summarise Langton&rsquo;s
discussion of silencing.</p>

<p>
According to Langton (1993), pornography helps to bring about rape by
perlocutionarily and illocutionarily silencing women. Following
Austin, Langton distinguishes between locutionary, illocutionary, and
perlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is, roughly, the act of
uttering words that have particular meanings; a perlocutionary act is,
roughly, the act of uttering words that have a particular effect; and
an illocutionary act is the act done in uttering the words. Consider,
for example, Jenny&rsquo;s utterance one day of the sentence &lsquo;I
pledge my allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and all her
heirs&rsquo;. The locutionary act she performed was simply the
utterance of a sentence with a particular meaning. This act had many
perlocutionary effects: it made it possible for her to get a British
passport, it made her feel slightly disturbed at having expressed such
monarchist sentiments, and it made her wonder whether a republic,
should it succeed the Queen, would count as an heir. The illocutionary
act she performed was that of becoming a British citizen.</p>

<p>
Langton proposes that there are forms of silencing corresponding to
each of these sorts of speech act. A person is locutionarily silenced
if she is prevented from speaking, or intimidated into not speaking. A
person is illocutionarily silenced if she is unable to carry out the
acts that she intends to carry out in speaking. A person is
perlocutionarily silenced when her speech cannot have its intended
effects. Langton is particularly concerned with the role that
perlocutionary and illocutionary silencing may play in rape. A
woman&rsquo;s refusal to have sex is perlocutionarily silenced
if&mdash;even though she is recognized as refusing&mdash;she is forced
to have sex. Her (attempted) refusal to have sex is illocutionarily
silenced if it is not even recognized as a refusal. (For an
exploration of the role of conventions in this illocutionary
silencing, see Wyatt 2009.) In such a case, according to Langton, it
<em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a refusal. She suggests that pornography plays a
key role in making men less able to recognise women&rsquo;s refusals
as refusals and more willing to rape women even when they recognise
women&rsquo;s refusals. This means, she argues, that pornography
illocutionarily and perlocutionarily silences women. And this
silencing is an important one, as it results in rape.</p>

<p>
This example can also help us to see that some elements of
individualism may be indispensable to feminism (for more arguments to
this effect, see Antony 1995). Assuming that Langton&rsquo;s arguments
are sound, we can see an important role for individualistic philosophy
of language in feminism. Although it is right that focusing
exclusively on individual speakers&rsquo; intentions would prevent us
from seeing some important facts (as Hornsby 2000 argues), it also
vital to recognise the importance of paying some attention to an
individual speaker&rsquo;s intentions. In order to understand what has
gone wrong in the illocutionary silencing described above, one needs
to understand that the woman <em>intended</em> to be refusing sex. In
order to understand what has gone wrong in the perlocutionary
silencing example, one needs to understand that the woman
<em>intended</em> her refusal to bring it about that she did not have
sex. More generally, not being understood properly is an important
element of life in a subordinate position, as many feminists have
noted. In order to make sense of not being understood properly, one
needs to attend to <em>what the speaker intended</em> and <em>how the
audience understood the speaker</em>, and how these things differ. To
do this, one needs to look at individual states of mind.</p>

<p>
These discussions have inspired a now substantial literature. Further
reading can be found in the section on pornography, hate speech, and
silencing in the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/#PornHateSpeeSile">hate speech</a>.
 Below, we give some very non-comprehensive pointers to this
literature.</p>

<ol>

<li>Some critics (e.g., Dworkin 1991, 1993; Jacobson 1995) have argued
that any silencing which may result from pornography is not of the
sort that free speech law should attempt to protect. (Responses to
these criticisms can be found in Hornsby and Langton 1998; Langton
2009a; and West 2003.)</li>

<li>Others, such as Leslie Green (1998), have argued that pornography
does not have the sort of authority needed to carry out acts of
subordination and silencing. Langton (2009b) has responded to this
criticism; and Mary Kate McGowan (2003) has argued that the sort of
authority needed for the acts in question is really quite a modest and
ordinary sort of conversational authority. Nellie Wieland (2007), like
McGowan, thinks that there is no need for the sort of authority that
worries Green. However, she argues that Langton&rsquo;s account runs
the risk of absolving rapists from culpability for their crimes.
(Jacobson 1995 also raises this culpability worry.) McGowan and Maitra
(2010) have responded to this, as do McGowan, Adelman, Helmers, and
Stolzenberg (2010). On the topic of authority more broadly, see
Tirrell (2018) for a discussion of the role of gender in authoritative
speech.</li>

<li>Jennifer Saul (2006a) worries about Langton&rsquo;s claim that
pornography itself is a speech act, arguing that only utterances in
contexts can be speech acts. Moreover, she suggests that if
Langton&rsquo;s claim is revised to be one about acts of viewing or
showing pornography it loses its plausibility. Claudia Bianchi (2008)
criticizes this, and Mari Mikkola (2008) responds.</li>

<li>A further concern about context comes from Tirrell (1999). Tirrell
argues that MacKinnon assigns pornography an authority so strong that
women would be unable to successfully articulate their own
experiences. She suggests that MacKinnon&rsquo;s picture needs
revising to make room for the successful communication that takes
place between feminists.</li>

<li>Alexander Bird (2002), Daniel Jacobson (1995) and Ishani Maitra
(2009) all raise worries about the Austinian distinction between
illocution and perlocution and its role in the silencing argument (in
particular, about the requirement that illocutions must be understood
to be successful). For Bird and Jacobson this leads to a rejection of
the silencing argument, but Maitra instead re-frames it in Gricean
terms. Angela Gr&uuml;nberg (2014) argues that the silencing argument
should be reconceived to focus not on illocutionary silencing, but on
locutionary or rhetic silencing. She suggests that this allows a
satisfying response to criticisms like those from Bird and Jacobson.
Mikkola (2011a) also defends Langton-Hornsby against Bird and
Jacobson.</li>

<li>Judith Butler (1997) objects to the silencing argument on several
grounds, chief among them (a) that it assumes an implausible picture
of language use; and (b) that silencing does not matter in the way
that Langton and Hornsby think that it does. Langton (2009c) has
responded to this worry.</li>

<li>Alex Davies (2016) argues that pornography may not just alter the
illocutionary force of women&rsquo;s utterances, but also block her
from making utterances with the content that she desires.
Davies&rsquo;s central example is the way that rape myths, perpetuated
by pornography, may make it impossible for women in courtroom cross
examinations to express the truth about their experiences.</li>

<li>Clausen (2020) evaluates the speech act of refusal in general
contexts: comparing sexual refusal to general refusal and arguing they
should be treated with the same significance. Mason (2023) evaluates
cases where refusal fails and argues that they do so due to a lack of
speaker authority. Caponetto (2023) gives a taxonomy of refusals in
what she calls a &ldquo;refusal family&rdquo;&mdash;speech acts that
include rejecting, declining, and other verbs that describe the
general act of &lsquo;saying no.&rsquo; Caponetto identifies
<em>proper refusals</em> as those that respond negatively to requests
for permissions, and, disagreeing with Mason, argues that only proper
refusals require speaker authority, and a refusal can succeed as an
illocutionary act even if it is ignored. One upshot of
Caponetto&rsquo;s argument is that &lsquo;consent&rsquo; and
&lsquo;refusal&rsquo; may not be the right categories when it comes to
talking about sex (see section 2.7).</li>

<li>In recent years, many philosophers have connected silencing to
other philosophical phenomena in feminist epistemology, philosophy of
race, philosophy of gender, trans philosophy, and political
philosophy. Davis 2018 identifies credibility excess as a kind of
testimonial injustice that involves self-silencing (following Dotson
2011&rsquo;s work of naming testimonial smothering as a kind of
self-silencing). Toole (2021) argues that white supremacy is an
epistemological system that works in part through silencing. Klieber
(2023, 2024) identifies the harmful phenomenon of silencing silences:
defined as what happens when individuals&mdash;often women&mdash;are
prevented from communicating things via their silence (see also
Swanson 2017 on omissive implicature). Fricker &amp; Jenkins (2017)
apply testimonial smothering to the trans experience, arguing that
many trans people experience <em>pre-emptive</em> testimonial
injustice. Medina (2023, 2024) connects silencing with the act of
protest. Medina (2024) identifies a kind of <em>preemptive
silencing</em> that occurs before a (speech) act of protest even
occurs, of which one kind is <em>pre-locutionary silencing</em>:
silencing that prevents a speech act from occurring in the first
place. Kukla, Herbert, Watson (forthcoming) describe how
confidentiality agreements silence victims of sexual violations as a
way of protecting institutions. McDonald (2020, 2022) expands the
silencing argument to cat-calls, coercion and compliments that
silence. Stoljar (2022) connects silencing to communication failure
and autonomy. Tanesini (2016) gives an account of intellectual
arrogance as a phenomenon that involves silencing other speakers and
hearers. Nowak (2020) identifies language loss (understood as the
disappearing of a currently existent spoken language) as a kind of
illocutionary silencing.</li>

<li>For recently published overviews on the variety of silencing, see:
Caponetto (2021) on kinds of silencing, Bianchi (2023) on varieties of
uptake, Harrison &amp; Tanter (2025) on further kinds of uptake and
their ethical implications, Schiller (2021) on varieties of
illocutionary harm, Ayala &amp; Vasilyeva (2016) on responsibility for
silence, and Dowell (2021) on kinds of silencing and assertion.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This use of speech act theory was one of the first developments of
feminist philosophy of language to gain mainstream currency, and it
has become widely taught and studied. Recently, however, sharply
critical feminist voices have started to emerge. Separately, and for
different reasons, Nancy Bauer (2015) and Lorna Finlayson (2014), have
both argued that the feminist literature on speech acts and
pornography is deeply misguided. Bauer objects on several grounds. She
thinks it is misguided to treat pornography as speech, and she (like
other critics noted above) argues that pornography should not be seen
as authoritative. Her more fundamental critique, though, is that this
literature fails to take seriously the realities of both pornography
and women&rsquo;s subordination&mdash;by not engaging sufficiently
with the phenomenology of pornography use; by not attending to all the
ways that the broader culture is involved in subordinating women; and
by focusing on just women&rsquo;s verbal acts of refusal, thereby
failing to appreciate the fuller dehumanization involved in sexual
assault. This is part of a broader critique, for Bauer, of both
analytic philosophy in general, and widespread understandings of
Austin. Finlayson goes even further, arguing not that Austin&rsquo;s
work was misused by feminists but that it never should have been used
at all. She suggests that the feminist foray into speech act theory
was entirely unnecessary, and also that the focus on pornography was
misguided.</p>

<p>
But there have also been very substantial developments broadening and
building upon the feminist use of speech theory&mdash;extending it to
issues like racist speech, and hate speech more generally. McGowan
(2009a) argues for the existence of a different sort of silencing due
to pornography; and in her 2009b she argues that speech may be counted
not just as silencing or subordinating, but also as oppressing.
Moreover, she suggests that oppressive speech is likely to be a very
widespread phenomenon. These ideas are developed further in McGowan
(2012), which takes as its focus racist speech, and in Simpson (2013).
Maitra (2012) also applies ideas from feminist work on subordinating
speech to racist speech. Langton also turns her attention to hate
speech more broadly, including in her 2012. This paper is also notable
for its focus on the role of pragmatics in shaping attitudes other
than belief. Rachel McKinney (2016), &ldquo;Extracted Speech&rdquo;,
builds on this literature by exploring the ways that speech may be
unjustly extracted rather than silenced (as in, for example, the
paradigm case of the Central Park Five&rsquo;s false confessions).
Quill Kukla, writing as Rebecca Kukla, introduces the notion of
discursive injustice, in order to discuss a broader range of ways that
&ldquo;members of a disadvantaged group face a systematic inability to
produce a specific kind of speech act they are entitled to
perform&rdquo; (2014: 440), which often takes the form of performing a
different speech act from the one that they intend. Although they draw
on Langton and Hornsby, they abandon Langton and Hornsby&rsquo;s focus
on illocution and perlocution, focussing instead simply on
performative force. Johnson 2020 argues for the existence of
illocutionary pluralism about speech acts: an utterance of
&lsquo;no&rsquo; in a sexual context &ldquo;could be a refusal
<em>and</em> a coy consenting&rdquo; (p.9). Johnson applies this
notion of illocutionary pluralism to mansplaining: giving an account
that explains mansplaining as a mismatch between participants&rsquo;
understanding of the illocutionary act associated with an utterance:
mansplainers react to women&rsquo;s assertions as though they are
requests or questions. Johnson agrees with Kukla that the audience
member or hearer who treats an assertion as a request has wronged the
speaker, but argues that this is a moral and epistemic wrong, rather
than a wrong in language. Johnson&rsquo;s view differs from
Kukla&rsquo;s insofar as Johnson holds that there is no factual
mistake on the part of the hearer who understands the illocutionary
act differently than the speaker does.</p>

<p>
Also considering the role of pragmatics in politics (though developed
independently from Langton and Hornsby), Marina Sbis&agrave; (1999)
explores the role of presuppositions in political persuasion. Finally,
Jason Stanley (2015) draws heavily on Langton and Hornsby&rsquo;s work
in developing his account of propaganda (focused, but not exclusively,
on racist propaganda).</p>

<h3 id="MeaGenTerCon">2.3 On the Meaning of Gender Terms and Concepts</h3>

<p>
In her ground-breaking paper &ldquo;Gender and Race: (What) Are They?
(What) Do We Want Them To Be?&rdquo; (2000b), Haslanger aims to
provide an account of the nature of gender, as well as an account of
the meaning of the concept <em>woman</em>. She assumes the classical
distinction between sex and gender, where <em>sex</em> is supposed to
refer to biological or anatomical properties distinguishing males from
females (although as she argues, this distinction is flexible and
permeated by social and political factors too), and <em>gender</em> is
supposed to refer to social or cultural factors distinguishing men
from women (see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-gender/">feminist perspectives on sex and gender</a>).
 One of the main virtues of Haslanger&rsquo;s article is that she
makes explicit the methodological approach that she endorses, to wit:
she famously distinguishes between a <em>descriptive</em> project,
which aims to reveal the concept that we actually use or the property
that we actually track with our usage of the term, and an
<em>analytical</em> project (or an <em>ameliorative</em> project, as
she calls it in Haslanger 2006), which aims to reveal the concept that
we should use or the meaning that we should associate to the
corresponding term, given our purposes and aims in that inquiry. As
she makes clear, she is following the analytical or ameliorative
approach, with the explicit aim of providing an account of the meaning
of <em>gender</em> and <em>woman</em> that could be a useful tool in
order to fight sexism and help to achieve social justice. With this
purpose in mind, she comes up with the following definition of the
concept <em>woman</em>, as one particular type of gender:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>S</em> <em>is a woman</em> iff<sub>def</sub> <em>S</em> is
systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,
legal, social, etc.) and <em>S</em> is &ldquo;marked&rdquo; as a
target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features
presumed to be evidence of a female&rsquo;s biological role in
reproduction. (2000b: 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we can see, the main idea of Haslanger&rsquo;s account is that
gender is a hierarchical social structure, where some members are
situated in a position of privilege and some other members are
situated in a position of subordination along social, economic,
political, legal, or cultural dimensions, in virtue of their real or
imagined biological role in reproduction. And more particularly, being
a woman corresponds to occupying a specific position of subordination
with respect to this social structure, due to one&rsquo;s perceived or
imagined biologically female bodily features.</p>

<p>
Haslanger&rsquo;s proposal gave rise to a rich debate about the
virtues of an ameliorative approach, and the advantages and problems
of this particular account. Although Haslanger&rsquo;s discussion
focuses mostly on the concept <em>woman</em>, many theorists also
extend the ameliorative approach to discussions about what the term
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; should mean. For instance, Saul (2006b) argued
that this proposed usage of the term &lsquo;woman&rsquo; could have
some problematic consequences, such as feminists having to advocate
for the eradication of women, since feminists advocate for the
eradication of the subordination of people in terms of their
biological role in reproduction. For this reason, Saul argued, this
might not be the most advantageous way of using the term
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;. In addition, Saul argued that the folk or
ordinary concept <em>woman</em> does not really distinguish between
sex as a biological feature and gender as a social or cultural
feature. Following up on this, Mikkola (2011b) argued that it might be
very costly to revise the ordinary meaning of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; in
the considerable ways that Haslanger suggests, since this might
jeopardize communication, in addition to the fact that gender identity
and the label &lsquo;woman&rsquo; might be a source of identity and
pride for many women. Therefore, to characterize being a woman in
terms of being subordinated, as Haslanger does, might not be
politically useful for the aims of feminism. Mikkola (2011b) put
forward an alternative account of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; that does not
endorse the sex/gender distinction: rather, she proposed a
<em>trait/norm covariance model</em>, according to which there are
different traits that are assigned to men or women (or males or
females) at a certain context, and that are expected to be followed
and instantiated. However, the different traits that are assigned to
men or to women are heavily context-dependent and flexible, and it is
possible to revise both the assignment of traits and the norms and
expectations involving them, in virtue of many kinds of factors,
including moral and political considerations.</p>

<p>
More recently, several feminists have argued that an account of
<em>woman</em> along the lines of Haslanger&rsquo;s proposal might
fail to do justice to the aims of trans women, which should be central
for the purposes of feminism. For example, Saul (2012) argues that
neither standard sex-based accounts nor standard gender-based accounts
are automatically going to be inclusive of trans women, since (at
least some) trans women could arguably turn out to be excluded from
the extension of the term &lsquo;woman&rsquo; when defined in terms of
biological features, or in terms of certain social and cultural
factors that are usually attributed to biologically female
individuals. Saul put forward a possible alternative view, namely, a
<em>contextualist</em> view of the meaning of &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em><em>X</em> is a woman</em> is true in a context <em>C</em> iff
<em>X</em> is human and relevantly similar (according to the standards
at work in <em>C</em>) to most of those possessing all of the
biological markers of female sex. (2012: 201)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to this account, an individual will fall under the extension
of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; in a certain context when she is sufficiently
similar to those who are biologically female, given the standards of
similarity that are relevant in such context, where these standards
can vary from context to context. Saul argues that at first sight,
this view seems to give the right results, since it would classify
trans women as women in most contexts where, say, self-identifying as
a woman is what is deemed relevant, but on further reflection, she
argues, the view can give unwanted results. For example, in a
conservative community where most speakers take for granted that trans
women should not be allowed to use women&rsquo;s toilets, their usage
of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; would be such that trans women would not fall
under the term, since the relevant criterion of similarity in that
context that those conservative speakers have in mind seems to be
something like having certain chromosomes or certain anatomical
features, which some trans women lack. In response to this worry, E.
Diaz-Leon (2016) has argued that we can understand the contextualist
view in a way that avoids this objection. In particular, she argues,
we can understand the relevant standards of similarity at work in each
context as those criteria that are the most politically useful, given
the aims and purposes that are morally salient in that context. For
example, in the context of a conservative community where trans women
are not allowed to use women&rsquo;s toilets, there are moral reasons
for focusing on criteria such as self-identifying as a woman, rather
than having certain biological features, and this is what makes this
criterion the relevant one in that context, and hence what fixes the
extension of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; in that context, as required. (See
also Bettcher 2017, Laskowski 2020, Zeman 2020a,b, Chen 2020, 2021,
Ichikawa 2020, and Cosker-Rowland 2024, for further discussion and
criticism of contextualist views about the meaning of gender terms,
and discussions of alternative semantic proposals such as polysemic
views (ones on which a term has multiple related meanings) and
relativist views about the meaning of &lsquo;woman&rsquo;.
D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n 2022 responds to some of the objections to
contextualism. See also Knoll 2022, 2024 and Kukla &amp; Lance 2023
for alternative accounts that explain gender ascriptions in pragmatic
terms.)</p>

<p>
Talia Bettcher (2013) has also argued that ameliorative accounts of
the meaning of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; should take into account the aims
of trans women. She argues that &ldquo;single-meaning&rdquo; views,
according to which &lsquo;woman&rsquo; has a unique meaning that is
shared by all speakers, cannot do justice to those aims. Instead, she
puts forward a &ldquo;multiple-meaning&rdquo; account, according to
which there are several co-existing meanings of the term
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; in our society, but where some of those meanings
embed world-views that are not only morally and politically
problematic, but also factually misguided, such as using
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; in a trans-exclusionary way. Because of this, we
have good reasons for using the term &lsquo;woman&rsquo; in our speech
with the trans-inclusive meaning that trans-friendly communities
already associate with the term. She also argues that although it is
methodologically useful to rely on intuitions, &ldquo;it is
inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways in which those terms are
actually used in trans subcultures; such usage needs to be taken into
consideration as part of the analysis&rdquo; (2013: 235). Pluralist
accounts are also developed by Briggs &amp; George (2023), Jenkins
(2023), Cull (2024) and D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n (2024).</p>

<p>
Katharine Jenkins (2016) argued that Haslanger&rsquo;s original
proposal excluded trans women from the extension of the concept
<em>woman</em>, which is morally and politically problematic. As
Jenkins argues, trans women who do not pass as <em>cis women</em>
(that is, those women who were assigned female at birth) do not occupy
a position of subordination <em>in virtue of</em> their perceived or
imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female
biological role in reproduction, since they are not presumed to have a
female biological role in reproduction (given that they do not pass as
cis women). For this reason, Haslanger&rsquo;s account cannot capture
the self-identity of those trans women as women, and the ways in which
they are subordinated in virtue of their gender identity. In order to
solve this problem, Jenkins proposes an ingenious account of gender in
terms of two elements, namely, gender as a social class, and gender as
social identity, where the former is similar to Haslanger&rsquo;s
notion of gender as social structures, and the latter has to do with
our own perceptions of our own positioning within those social
structures. Following Haslanger&rsquo;s (2005) account of racial
identity, Jenkins suggests an account of gender identity in terms of
mental maps that serve to guide our own behavior, norms and
expectations within the social niches that we live in. (For criticism
of Jenkins&rsquo; account as insufficiently inclusive of trans women,
see Andler 2017.) Cosker-Rowland (2023) provides a useful survey of
ameliorative analyses of gender concepts in terms of gender
identity.</p>

<p>
Haslanger (2020) provides a useful clarification of the aims of her
original ameliorative analysis of gender concepts, partly in response
to the rich discussion that followed the publication of her (2000b)
piece. As Haslanger (2020) reminds us, one of her original aims was to
respond to critiques of realist conceptions of gender that were common
in the last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (e.g. Spelman
1988). In response to anti-realist concerns that contended that there
is no common trait that all women had in common, Haslanger (2000b)
aimed to offer an ameliorative analysis of gender that emphasizes the
process of social formation that underlies gender. As Haslanger (2020)
explains, she was more interested in the process of social formation
rather than social identities, and she saw social identities as a
causal result of that process. Moreover, Haslanger (2000b) already
remarked that appropriating current gender terminologies to refer to
new categories must be done with caution, and that what can be useful
in some contexts and for some purposes might not be so in other
contexts and for some other purposes. However, as she acknowledges in
(2020), the appropriation of gender terms such as &lsquo;man&rsquo;
and &lsquo;woman&rsquo; to express her ameliorative hierarchical
conceptions of gender was more problematic than she anticipated in her
(2000b) piece, since these analyses exclude people who should not be
excluded, as Bettcher (2013), Jenkins (2016), Kapusta (2016), Kirkland
(2018) and others have shown. At the same time, the aim of
Haslanger&rsquo;s ameliorative analyses of gender concepts was to
emphasize and make salient the processes of social formation of gender
categories that are unjust and exclusionary.</p>

<p>
In this section so far we have focused on <em>semantic</em> accounts
of the meaning of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and the concept <em>woman</em>,
although recently there has also been an explosion of work about the
issue of the connection between the semantics of gender terms and the
<em>metaphysics</em> of gender as a social class, and also about the
notion of biological sex as a contested category. Some of these
discussions have implications for the meanings of the corresponding
terms &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;female&rsquo;. For example, Saray
Ayala and Nadya Vasilyeva (2015) provide an account of biological sex
in terms of extended, flexible biological features, where which
features count for being male or female can change from context to
context, depending on our aims and purposes, and where those extended
biological features can be taken to incorporate features of the
environment, artificial bodily features, and so on. On the other hand,
Helen Daly (2015) has argued that we should favour semantic accounts
of &lsquo;female&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo; that do not assume a
sharp cut-off point between those who fall under the term and those
who do not, since this is morally and politically problematic. In
addition, Jennifer McKitrick (2015) has argued that an account of
gender in terms of dispositions to behave in certain ways can be
politically useful, and can capture the aims of trans women. Moreover,
Haslanger (2016) has defended a context-sensitive account of
&lsquo;sex&rsquo;, where the term can have different meanings,
depending on the aims and purposes of the inquiry in that context.
Furthermore, recently there has been a lot of interest in discussions
about the alleged connection between the meaning of gender terms (or
the content of gender concepts), and the metaphysics of gender
categories: see, for instance, Barnes (2019), Dembroff (2018) and
D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n (2024). Finally, recently there have been some
philosophers defending the view that gender terms such as
&lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo; do or should pick out the
property of being biologically male and being biologically female,
respectively, instead of picking out gender kinds, as is customary in
feminist theory (e.g. Bogardus 2020a,b and 2022, and Byrne 2020). See
Bettcher (2025), Dembroff (2020), Arvan (2023) and Mason (2024) for
compelling responses.</p>

<h3 id="AmeProConEng">2.4 Ameliorative Projects and Conceptual Engineering</h3>

<p>
As we saw in the previous section, Haslanger (2000b) brought attention
to the need for revisionary or ameliorative approaches in feminist
philosophy, as opposed to purely conceptual or descriptive approaches,
which focus on the concept we have or the objective type that we
actually track. The idea of a revisionary or ameliorative approach to
the analysis of our concepts has been a very influential one in
philosophy, but Haslanger&rsquo;s work has served as a kind of
reminder of the significance of aiming for the concepts that would
best serve our purposes and aims, rather than merely revealing the
ordinary concepts that we happen to have, which is the task that many
projects in recent mainstream analytic philosophy seem to have paid
attention to. Haslanger&rsquo;s work has inspired a lot of interesting
ameliorative projects in philosophy of gender and race and social
philosophy more in general (see for instance Glasgow 2006, 2009 and
Mallon 2006 on &lsquo;race&rsquo;, Barnes 2016 on
&lsquo;disability&rsquo;, Dembroff 2016 on &lsquo;sexual
orientation&rsquo;, as well as many of the papers on
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;sex&rsquo; and &lsquo;gender&rsquo; cited
in the previous section). As suggested above, the notion of an
ameliorative project in philosophy is not new, but in our view the
impetus that this methodological approach in philosophy has
experienced recently owes much to the centrality that this notion has
played in recent developments in philosophy of gender and race over
the last two decades.</p>

<p>
As ameliorative projects are becoming more common in mainstream
analytic philosophy, they have given rise to a careful examination of
the methodological foundations and the metaphysical, semantic and
epistemic aspects of the ameliorative approach, as well as its moral
and political implications. Alexis Burgess and David Plunkett
(2013a,b) have usefully surveyed these and related issues pertaining
to ameliorative projects in philosophy, and have coined a new label:
<em>conceptual ethics</em>. They intend this new term to refer to the
philosophical reflection about the terms and concepts that we ought to
use in different areas, given our best normative reasoning, as well as
the methodological and philosophical issues to which these projects
give rise. Examples include the nature of the values and normative
considerations that should guide our choice of terms and concepts, as
well as semantic questions about the nature and possibility of
conceptual change and conceptual revision, among many others. One of
the advantages of having this new label is that discussions on these
normative issues about our talk and thought that were formerly
scattered can now be more unified and more systematic.</p>

<p>
Another term that is becoming prominent in this area is that of
<em>conceptual engineering</em>, which is supposed to refer to
ameliorative projects that aim to revise our current concepts and
engineer new concepts that can better serve our main purposes. This
term originates from discussions about Carnap&rsquo;s methodological
insights (see for instance French 2015 for a useful overview), but is
now being used in a more general, encompassing sense. See Cull (2021)
for an argument tracing the idea of conceptual engineering to black
feminist philosophers. Several philosophers have recently argued that
we could understand many traditional debates in philosophy as debates
in conceptual ethics or conceptual engineering (see for instance
Floridi 2011 and Plunkett 2015). Moreover, Cappelen (2018) wrote a
monograph about foundational issues in conceptual engineering, drawing
on Haslanger&rsquo;s work and other feminist and anti-racist
philosophers. Cappelen&rsquo;s discussions of foundational issues such
as what we revise when we revise the meaning of a term, whether
revising a term&rsquo;s meaning is within our control, and when
revisions of a term&rsquo;s meaning go too far so as to change the
topic, have given rise to an explosion of interesting work on
foundational issues about conceptual ethics or conceptual engineering.
Such work includes assessments of the prospects, the scope and the
significance of ameliorative projects in philosophy (see e.g. the
articles included in Burgess, Cappelen &amp; Plunkett (2020) and
Isaac, Scharp and Koch (forthcoming)). This growing literature can be
seen as an example of debates in feminist philosophy of language
having a significant impact in mainstream philosophy of language.</p>

<h3 id="HerInj">2.5 Hermeneutical Injustice</h3>

<p>
As we saw in section 1.5, Fricker (2007) argues that there is a
distinctive kind of injustice that has to do with the inability to
properly understand and communicate important aspects of one&rsquo;s
social experience: she calls this <em>hermeneutical injustice</em>.
According to Fricker, people in a position of marginalization are
prevented from creating concepts, terms and other representational
resources that could be used in order to conceptualize and understand
their own experiences, especially those having to do with being in
that position of marginalization. People in a position of power will
tend to create concepts and linguistic representations that help to
conceptualize the experiences and phenomena that matter <em>to
them</em>, rather than the experiences and phenomena that matter the
most to people in a position of marginalization. Because of this,
members of marginalized groups might suffer from a lacuna in the
representational resources that are available to them, and in
particular might lack the concepts and terms that would allow them to
understand and communicate their experiences. In order to illustrate
this phenomenon, Fricker (2007) focuses on several examples, such as
the articulation of the term &lsquo;sexual harassment&rsquo;: before
the term was coined, victims of sexual harassment lacked the language
to explain their experiences of receiving unwanted sexual advances at
work in a way that would make clear why those interactions
<em>wronged</em> them. But through meeting together and discussing
common experiences they developed a new concept, <em>sexual
harassment</em>. And eventually this concept was taken up more
broadly.</p>

<p>
There is by now a large and flourishing literature on hermeneutical
injustice, developing the notion in many directions. One line of
inquiry has focused on the significance and existence of hermeneutical
gaps. Laura Beeby (2011) has emphasised the <em>epistemic</em>
symmetry of the gaps between the marginalised and the more powerful
(for example the harasser and the harassee). Several authors have
disputed the idea that the marginalized <em>generally</em> lack the
ability to conceptualize and communicate their own experiences
(Rebecca Mason 2011, Kristie Dotson 2012, Gaile Pohlhaus 2012 and
Jos&eacute; Medina 2013), and called into question the idea of a
single shared hermeneutical resource. This work has important
precursors in the work of Patricia Hill Collins&rsquo;s (1990/2022)
discussion of black women developing new concepts together in order to
articulate their experiences, concepts that were unavailable in the
dominant conceptual resources. For example, Mason (2011) and Medina
(2013) have both argued that although Fricker is right that people in
a situation of marginalization might not have access to publicly
shared terms in order to communicate their experiences to those in a
position of power, they might nonetheless be able to make sense of
their own experiences in a useful way, even before those public
concepts are introduced in the dominant language. Mason (2011) argues
that what they often actually lack is the power to introduce these
meanings into the collective understanding, which is unjust, and which
results in the fact that dominant groups have a distorted
understanding of the social experiences of non-dominant groups.
Pohlhaus (2012) has argued that marginalized subjects are in a better
position to notice gaps in our collective epistemic resources in order
to properly describe and conceptualize the experiences of those who
are socially oppressed, and to work collectively to develop new
conceptual resources. Indeed, according to Medina (2013), this is
necessary for the introduction of better conceptual resources in our
shared language. But Pohlhaus (2012) argues that <em>wilful
hermeneutical ignorance</em> often keeps the more powerful from using
the resources that the marginalised develop. This can connect with
what Derek Anderson (2017) has called <em>conceptual competence
injustice</em>, in which marginalised subjects are wrongly taken to be
incompetent users of concepts. Relatedly, Dotson (2012) introduces the
concept of <em>contributory injustice</em>. This kind of epistemic
injustice has to do not only with the phenomenon of willfully ignoring
the epistemic resources developed by the marginalized, but also with
the continuous use of distorted epistemic resources developed by those
in a position of power, without paying attention to the experiences of
the marginalized. This use of faulty conceptual resources acts to
block the uptake of the new conceptual resources developed by the
marginalized, which leads to further misunderstandings. Han Edgoose
(2024) has introduced the idea of <em>hermeneutical sabotage</em> for
the practice of dominant knowers actively worsening shared
hermeneutical resources by distorting the resistant resources that
have been developed. A related notion is that of <em>hermeneutical
backlash</em> (George and Goguen 2021), a targeting by dominant forces
of hermeneutical liberation. This takes the form of undermining
hermeneutical liberation by casting doubt on its key
features&mdash;for example by seeing growing adoption of a liberatory
concept as &ldquo;social contagion&rdquo;. Luvell Anderson has
introduced the idea of a <em>hermeneutical impasse</em>, which occurs
when &ldquo;agents engaged in communicative exchange are unable to
achieve understanding due to a gap in shared hermeneutical
resources&rdquo; (2017: 3). He uses this to explain the impasse
between those who endorse &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; and those
who endorse &ldquo;All Lives Matter&rdquo;. (For other takes on
&ldquo;All Lives Matter&rdquo; see Atkins 2018, Keiser 2021, Clapp
2022.) Goetze (2018) offers a useful taxonomy of the ways in which
groups&rsquo; and individuals&rsquo; relationships to each
other&rsquo;s hermeneutical resources can give rise to different sorts
of hermeneutical injustices.</p>

<p>
How to respond to hermeneutical injustice is a further issue. Fricker
(2007) focuses on developing the virtue of hermeneutical justice.
Elizabeth Anderson (2012) argues that there should be more attention
paid to the epistemic justice of <em>social institutions</em>. George
Hull (2017) argues that consciousness-raising is very important, not
only as a means to overcoming hermeneutical injustice, but it
&ldquo;can itself constitute the overcoming of hermeneutical
injustice&rdquo; (2017: 585). Charlie Crerar (2016) suggests that we
need not just the right concepts but also &ldquo;access to an
<em>expressively free environment</em> in which to put these concepts
to work: an open and receptive social context in which a particular
experience that individuals or groups have a significant interest in
coming to understand can be discussed in hermeneutically conducive
ways&rdquo; (2016: 205). Medina (2013) argues that members of dominant
groups should be more sensitive to inchoate attempts at communication
by people in a position of subordination, even before they have access
to shared concepts to properly conceptualize those aspects of our
social interactions. Romdenh-Romluc (2016) poses an important
challenge by considering the importance of deciding <em>which</em>
non-dominant resources should be adopted more widely. A key example
for her is the anti-Muslim conceptual resources of the marginalised
members of the English Defence League. She argues that these
<em>should not</em> be adopted more widely, but that it is difficult
to formulate criteria to rule this out. Goetze and Crerar (2022) argue
that we can achieve hermeneutical justice with respect to extremists
by carefully distinguishing between understanding and accepting a
world view.</p>

<p>
The concept of hermeneutical injustice has been widely taken up across
a wide range of issues including domestic abuse (Jenkins 2017); child
abuse (Lo 2023); sexual violence (Haenel 2020, Jackson 2019, Jenkins
2017); gendered language (Rosola 2024); trans issues (Fricker and
Jenkins 2017, George and Goguen 2021); LGBTQ asylum seekers
(Boncompagni 2021); and health/illness (Kidd and Carel 2014 and 2018,
Ritunanno 2022, Chen et. al. 2021).</p>

<h3 id="Gen">2.6 Generics</h3>

<p>
Generic statements are ones such as &ldquo;cats are furry&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;a cat has fur&rdquo;, which are neither universal
generalizations (there are furless cats) nor existential
generalization (the claim being made is clearly stronger). They give
rise to many puzzles, which have for some time interested both
linguists and philosophers. For a fuller discussion, see
 <a href="../generics/">the entry on generics</a>.
 Our focus here is the social and political import that has recently
been suggested for generic statements about social groups, on which
there is a growing literature. This literature takes as its starting
point Sarah-Jane Leslie&rsquo;s work (Leslie 2015; Wodak, Leslie, and
Rhodes 2015). Of key interest here are examples such as &ldquo;boys
don&rsquo;t cry&rdquo; or &ldquo;women place their families before
their careers&rdquo;. These sentences can be used to express merely
descriptive claims&mdash;describing, for example, crying as something
not that many boys do. But they can also be used to make normative
claims about what boys or women <em>should</em> do. Wodak, Leslie, and
Rhodes (2015) suggest that &ldquo;we can understand the difference
between normative and descriptive generics in terms of the different
concepts picked out by the noun phrase in the generics
themselves&rdquo; (Wodak et. al. 2015: 629). &lsquo;Woman&rsquo; may
pick out a normative concept&mdash;an ideal, which might include such
things as a focus on family over career; or, alternatively, it may
pick out a descriptive concept, and refer to women regardless of
whether they focus on family over career. Leslie uses this as a
foundation for explaining utterances like &ldquo;Hillary Clinton is
the only man in the Obama White House&rdquo;, suggesting that
&lsquo;man&rsquo; here is a dual character concept, and refers in the
sentence above to the ideal of manliness. According to Leslie,
normative generics operate using this kind of polysemy. It is also a
part of a more general project of arguing that generic utterances have
harmful effects on social cognition. See Hesni 2021 and Lemeire 2023
for arguments against a polysemous dual character concept view of
normative generics, and Del Pinal and Reuter 2016 for empirical
considerations that amend Leslie&rsquo;s view of normative generics.
Leslie (2017) also discusses what she calls &ldquo;striking property
generics&rdquo;, statements that attribute dangerous properties to
groups generically specified&mdash;like &ldquo;Scots are violent
drunkards&rdquo; or &ldquo;Muslims are terrorists&rdquo;. She argues
that striking property generic claims may not require many instances
to be accepted as true (assuming some other conditions are also met)
allowing them to serve as a key mechanism in perpetuating and
exacerbating prejudice. (For some criticisms of Leslie on striking
property generics, see Saul 2023 and Sterken 2015a,b.)</p>

<p>
Haslanger (2011) has built on Leslie&rsquo;s work, arguing that
generic claims often carry conversational implicatures about natures,
and that these help them to serve as a key mechanism for perpetuating
the ideologies that hold unjust social structures in place. She
suggests that&mdash;whatever their truth conditions (one understanding
of Leslie&rsquo;s view would make striking property generic claims
very easily true)&mdash;one should deny them via the mechanism of
meta-linguistic negation (Horn 1985) which allows the denial of a
claim because it carries a false implicature. By this method, we can
start to disrupt the ideologies that have us in their grip. (For
criticism of this, see Saul 2023). For criticisms of the view that
generics are particularly suited to make harmful essentializing
claims, see Ritchie (2019), Hoicka et al. (2021), and Reuter, Neufeld,
and del Pinal (2023).</p>

<h3 id="NewDir">2.7 New Directions</h3>

<p>
In this section we point very briefly to some of the newly emerging
literatures in feminist philosophy of language.</p>

<h4>2.7.1 Sexual Communication</h4>

<p>
Sexual communication has always been an important issue for feminists.
As we have seen, it is an important part of the literature on
silencing&mdash;in particular the inability of women to succeed in
refusing sex. There has also, of course, been
 <a href="../feminism-rape/">substantial discussion</a>
 of consent and refusal in the
 <a href="../feminism-rape/">literature on rape</a>
 more generally. There have been feminist criticisms of
conceptualizing sex in terms of consent and refusal, but until
recently these have not come from feminist philosophy of language. In
recent years, feminist philosophers of language have begun to argue
against an excessive focus on just the presence or absence of consent
and refusal in discussions of sex. Emily Tilton and Jonathan Ichikawa
(2021) are primarily focused on sexual deception, but crucially they
also argue for discussing not just the question of whether consent is
present, but also the linguistic question of <em>what was consented
to</em>. Madeleine Kenyon (forthcoming) has argued that careful
consideration of the indispensable role of demonstratives in sexual
consent poses problems for the idea of fully explicit consent.
Ichikawa (2020) suggests that the language of consent carries the
presupposition that sex must always be &ldquo;at someone else&rsquo;s
behest&rdquo;&mdash;and that this idea is tied to problematic gender
norms. Finally Laura Caponetto (2023) has recently argued that sexual
requests have been wrongly understood as permission requests, and this
has led to a distorted understanding of sexual refusals. Quill Kukla
(2018) suggests a much greater broadening of feminist discussions of
sex. By urging a shift to considering negotiation, Kukla discusses
topics such as the speech acts involved in initiating sex (as
invitation or gift, to take two of their examples), the use of
non-literal language, safe words, and consensual nonconsent. Building
on this broader idea of sexual communication, Lucy MacDonald (2022)
has offered an analysis of flirting.</p>

<h4>2.7.2 Manipulative Communication</h4>

<p>
In recent years, philosophers of language have become increasingly
interested in manipulative speech, and feminist philosophers of
language are no exception. This is a relatively new literature, but
intriguing directions are being mapped out.</p>

<p>
Sara Bernstein (2024) has argued for the importance of what she calls
&lsquo;biased evaluative descriptions&rsquo;, apparently positive
descriptions, whose use displays a pattern influenced by biases. An
example is the use of &lsquo;calm and professional&rsquo; to praise a
Black woman: the description is positive, but it would be unlikely to
be used to describe a White man.</p>

<p>
Jennifer Saul has discussed the use of figleaves&mdash;additional
communicative items that provide just a little bit of cover for what
would otherwise be recognized as clearly norm-violating. She explores
sexist figleaves in her 2021 chapter on racist and sexist figleaves.
Madeleine Kenyon (2024) builds on this to discuss the ways that
figleaves are used to evade accusations of sexual violence.</p>

<h4>2.7.3 Misgendering and Deadnaming</h4>

<p>
Recent work has begun to develop detailed analyses of harmful
phenomena previously understudied by philosophers of language,
misgendering and deadnaming. Stephanie Kapusta&rsquo;s (2016) provides
a careful analysis of the nature of misgendering and the harms that it
causes. Dembroff and Wodak (2018, 2021) build on this work, but also
argue for a more restricted understanding of misgendering, one which
allows them to argue for a (defeasible) moral obligation to use
gender-neutral pronouns for everyone. Deadnaming occurs when a trans
person is called by a name that they no longer use. Klieber and Bolton
(forthcoming) argue that this is importantly distinct from
misgendering, and offer an analysis of its harms. Koles (2024)
explores the semantics of deadnaming.</p>

<h4>2.7.4 Social Scripts</h4>

<p>
Philosophers write about social scripts as, variously, psychological,
linguistic, or social entities that encode expectations about norms,
language, and behavior: they indicate how to act and what to say in
certain situations and are often internalized. A classic example is
the English greeting script: &ldquo;Hi, how are
you?&rdquo;&ldquo;Fine, and you?&rdquo; Although much of the work that
brings social scripts to bear on feminist issues treats scripts as
cognitive (Valian 2005, Bicchieri 2005, Spaulding 2018, Eickers 2024,
Plakias 2024) or social (Butler 1988, Appiah 2001, Oshana 2005,
Bettcher 2014, Stoljar 2014, Haslanger 2015, Dembroff 2018), a growing
number of researchers have been combining philosophy of language with
social scripts, with emphases on scripts and gender (Berio &amp;
Musholt 2022, Hesni 2024, 2025, Emerick, Stockdale, and Yap 2023).
However, to the extent that scripts involve narratives (Appiah 2001
Bettcher 2014, Dembroff 2018), and narratives are related to language,
all of these thinkers have insights to offer feminist philosophy of
language. Stoljar (2014), drawing on the insights of Marina Oshana and
Diana Tietjens Meyers, talks about how certain scripts (like
motherhood, compulsory heterosexuality (see Dembroff 2014 and Scheman
2011)), are autonomy constraining. Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that
life scripts around being gay or being African-American can be
constraining to individuals&rsquo; autonomy, and Marina Oshana
responds with respect to scripts about being an African American woman
in particular, arguing that by exercising autonomy over which features
are central to one&rsquo;s identity, one can overcome or resist some
agency-constraining features of scripts. Bettcher (2014) argues that
sexuality is scripted, in a way analogous to how Butler (1988) tells
us that gender itself is scripted, and Dembroff 2014 (drawing on
Scheman 2011), points to the existence of heteronormativity scripts
and narratives to highlight the injustice of exclusion of non-binary
identities in dominant contexts. Eickers (2024) also argues that
social scripts reinforce the binary gender system. Hesni (2024) argues
that many social scripts place us in double-binds, with an emphasis on
sexist and transphobic harassment scripts. Berio &amp; Musholt (2022)
connect social scripts to stereotypes, arguing that social scripts
play a role in stereotype formation by way of contributing to
generics, in contrast with Valian (2005) who argues that scripts
<em>are</em> stereotypes, and Hesni (forthcoming) who argues that
stereotypes both give rise to social scripts and are informed by
social scripts. Spaulding (2018) argues that stereotypes and
stereotype-derived inferences makes certain scripts more readily
available. Emerick, Stockdale, and Yap (2023) show how gendered
scripts around forgiveness place harmful burdens and expectations on
women to forgive wrongdoings when it is not in their best interest to
do so.</p>
