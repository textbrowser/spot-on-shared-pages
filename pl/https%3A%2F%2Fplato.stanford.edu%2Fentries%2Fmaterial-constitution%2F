What is the relationship between a clay statue and the lump of clay
from which it is formed? We might say that the lump
<em>constitutes</em> the statue, but what is the relation of
<em>material constitution</em>? Some insist that <em>constitution is
identity</em>, on the grounds that distinct material objects cannot
occupy the same place at the same time. Others argue that
<em>constitution is not identity</em>, since the statue and the lump
differ in important respects. Still others take cases like this to
motivate revisionary views about persistence, identity, or
existence.</p>

<h2><a id="Puz">1. The Puzzles</a></h2>

<p>
Puzzles of material constitution played an important role in the
development of Greek philosophy and continue to be a source of much
debate today. Here, we introduce four of the most famous puzzles.</p>

<p>
<em>The Debtor&rsquo;s Paradox</em>. The ancient playwright Epicharmus
tells of a poor but resourceful debtor. When approached for payment,
the man responds with a riddle. If you add a pebble to a collection,
you no longer have the same number. If you add a length to a cubit,
you no longer have the same measure. In the same way, if you add a bit
of matter to an existing portion, you no longer have the same entity.
Since man is nothing more than a material object whose matter is
constantly changing, we do not survive from one moment to the next.
The debtor concludes that he is not the same person who took out the
loan and cannot be held responsible for the payment. In response, the
creditor strikes the riddler, who protests the abuse. The creditor
expresses sympathy, but points out that he cannot be held responsible
since he is no longer the same person who committed the assault. The
scene is intended to be comedic, but the argument is no laughing
matter. The man who incurred the debt was constituted by one portion
of matter, M1, whereas the man who is approached for payment is
constituted by a distinct portion, M2 (perhaps M2 consists of M1,
together with some new matter). If constitution is identity, then the
debtor&rsquo;s reasoning is sound: the man approached for payment is
not the one who incurred the debt. More generally, this reasoning
suggests that material objects cannot survive the addition of any new
parts. (Note: the claim that constitution is identity is distinct from
the thesis of &ldquo;composition as identity&rdquo;&mdash;on the
latter, see section 8 of the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/#8">identity</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
<em>The Puzzle of Dion and Theon</em>. The Stoic philosopher
Chrysippus considers the case of Dion and Theon, where Dion is a
normal human being and Theon is the part of Dion consisting of
everything but his right foot. If the foot is removed, then Theon
obviously survives the operation, for his parts remain completely
unchanged. But, in that case, it seems as if Dion does <em>not</em>
survive the operation, for otherwise we would have two people in the
same place at the same time. Hence, Dion does not survive the loss of
his foot. More generally, this reasoning would show that material
objects cannot survive the loss of any parts. (A more recent version
of the puzzle, due to Peter Geach, concerns Tibbles and Tib, where
Tibbles is a cat and Tib consists of everything but Tibbles&rsquo;s
tail.)</p>

<p>
<em>The Ship of Theseus Puzzle</em>. The ancient historian Plutarch
describes the famous ship of Theseus whose parts were all gradually
replaced over time. The resulting vessel was eventually displayed in
Athens, where philosophers debated whether it was still the same ship.
In the modern era, Thomas Hobbes imagined a scenario in which a
custodian collects the original planks and puts them back in the
original arrangement. In this version of the story, we are left with
two seafaring vessels, one on display in Athens and one in possession
of the custodian. But where is the original Ship of Theseus? Some will
say that it is with the museum, since boats can survive the gradual
replacement of parts. Others will say that it is with the custodian,
since constructs can survive being taken apart and put back together.
Both arguments seem compelling, but together they imply that the ship
survives twice over. We get an equally odd result by working
backwards. There are clearly two ships at the end of the story, but
then both of those vessels would have to have been around at the
beginning, for the reasons just given. So, at the beginning of the
story, there were two ships of Theseus occupying the same place at the
same time&mdash;one of which would go on to the museum and one of
which would end up with the custodian.</p>

<p>
<em>The Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay</em>. Various ancient
philosophers, including Aristotle, pointed out that statues seem to
differ in important respects from the portions of matter from which
they are made. Suppose that a sculptor purchases a lump of clay on
Monday which he names &lsquo;Lump&rsquo;. The artist then sculpts the
clay into a statue on Tuesday, titling his work &lsquo;David&rsquo;.
It is tempting to think that there is a single objet present in this
case&mdash;David <em>just is</em> Lump. But, on reflection, the statue
and the lump of clay appear to differ. The latter, for example,
existed on Monday, while the former did not. Moreover, the lump could
survive being squashed tomorrow, whereas the statue could not. This
would imply the distinctness of David and Lump, since Leibniz&rsquo;s
Law requires identical objects to have all the same features.</p>

<p>
These cases differ in detail, but raise a common problem. (Another
famous
 puzzle&mdash;<a href="../problem-of-many/">the problem of the many</a>&mdash;raises
 significantly different issues and is dealt with in a separate
entry.) We will focus on the case of the statue and the clay, and we
will formulate the challenge as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>David did not exist on Monday (but does exist on Tuesday).</li>

<li>Lump did exist on Monday (and also exists on Tuesday).</li>

<li>If (1) and (2), then David is not identical to Lump.</li>

<li>[So] David is not identical to Lump.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The premises of the argument are plausible, but the conclusion implies
the possibility of <em>spatially coincident
objects</em>&mdash;something which we ordinarily take to be impossible
(Wiggins 1968: 90). Moreover, the claim that the David is not
identical to Lump seems to conflict with at least some of our ordinary
judgements about this kind of case (Lewis 1986: 252). For example, it
is natural to think that David is a lump of clay which has been formed
into the shape of a man; this entails that David is a lump of clay.
Assuming there is only one such lump present, it would follow that
David is identical to Lump. Hence, there appears to be a tension in
our ordinary ways of thinking about such cases. (For more more on the
connection between constitution and ordinary language, see Pickel
2010, Almotahari 2014, and van Elswyk 2018; for a more detailed
statement of the problem of material constitution, see Rea 1995,
1997.)</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, there are five potential replies to this argument.
First, one could accept (4) and admit that David is not identical to
Lump. We consider this idea in sections 2 and 3, when we discuss
<em>the constitution view</em> of David Wiggins (1968) and <em>the
temporal parts theory</em> of David Lewis (1976). Second, one could
deny (1) by either rejecting the existence of David or by insisting
that David existed on Monday. We examine these approaches in section
4, where we review the <em>eliminativist</em> views of Peter Unger
(1979), Peter van Inwagen (1990), and Roderick Chisholm (1979). Third,
one could deny (2) by either rejecting the existence of Lump (as the
eliminativist does) or by claiming that Lump does not survive being
shaped into a statue. We consider the second option in section 5, when
we discuss the <em>dominant kinds view</em> of Michael Burke (1992).
Fourth, one could deny (3) by rejecting the standard formulation of
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. We consider this response in section 6, where we
address <em>the relative identity theory</em> of Peter Geach (1967).
Finally, one could claim that the debate is in some sense verbal or
otherwise defective, so that the alleged puzzle is not worth our time.
We examine this idea in section 7, when we look at the
<em>deflationist</em> views of Rudolf Carnap (1950) and others. (Note:
while our focus throughout will be on material objects like statues
and lumps of clay, similar issues arise for other entities, including
events, properties, and groups&mdash;see, for example, Pfeifer 1989,
Shoemaker 2003, and Uzquiano 2004a.)</p>

<h2><a id="CoiObj">2. Coincident Objects</a></h2>

<p>
The most common reply to the puzzle of material constitution is to
embrace the conclusion: David and Lump are numerically distinct,
spatially coincident objects. This view is sometimes referred to as
<em>the constitution view</em> since it holds that the statue is
constituted by, but not identical to, the lump in question. As David
Wiggins (1968: 91) puts it, the constituted object &ldquo;consists
in&rdquo; and is &ldquo;nothing over and above&rdquo; the object from
which it is made. (For more on the nature of constitution, see
Wasserman 2004, Wilson 2007, and Kovac 2020.)</p>

<p>
The constitution view is extremely popular, having been defended by
Wiggins (1968, 2001), Simons (1985), Yablo (1987), Lowe (1995, 2003),
Baker (1997, 2000), Thomson (1998), Shoemaker (1988, 1999), Fine
(2000, 2003), Hawthorne (2006), Koslicki (2008), and many others.
Indeed, the view is sometimes described as &ldquo;the standard
account&rdquo; (Burke 1992). Why not join the crowd?</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just try to walk through a wall,&rdquo; quips the skeptic.
&ldquo;Two things can&rsquo;t be in the same place at the same
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In response, the constitution theorist will point out that David and
Lump&mdash;unlike you and the wall&mdash;share the same parts. That
explains how they are able to share the same space. (Wiggins 1968) So
too, the sharing of parts&mdash;what is sometimes called <em>material
coincidence</em>&mdash;would explain how those objects share the same
weight, shape, and so on. (Zimmerman 1995: 89, n.57)</p>

<p>
Material coincidence may explain how spatial coincidence is possible,
but what about material coincidence itself? On the face of it, the
idea that two things can share the exact same parts is no more
plausible than the claim that they can fit into the same region of
space.</p>

<p>
In response, the constitution theorist could simply insist that
objects like David and Lump coincide this way. (Thomson 1983) However,
this would require giving up on classical
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>,
 which takes wholes to be individuated by parts in the same way that
sets are determined by members. Alternatively, some constitution
theorists have claimed that David and Lump share <em>many</em> of the
same parts without sharing <em>all</em>. For example, Baker (2000: 81)
suggests that David&rsquo;s nose is a part of David, but not a part of
Lump. Others claim that coinciding objects share all the same
<em>material</em> parts but differ in some non-material aspect. The
most famous version of this idea goes back to Aristotle and his view
that objects are compounds of matter and <em>form</em> (see Rea 1998,
Koslicki 2008, and section 8 of the entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-metaphysics/">Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics</a>;
 for a different way of developing this general strategy, see McDaniel
2001, Paul 2002, and Jago 2021).</p>

<p>
Whether or not David and Lump share all the same parts, it is clear
that they share many of the same properties. For example, both have
the same weight, shape, coloring, and so on. Indeed, the two seem to
be perfect duplicates, right down to their subatomic structure. But
this raises a puzzle: how could duplicates of this kind differ with
respect to their temporal properties, persistence conditions, and the
like? After all, those differences must be grounded in more basic
differences between the objects. But there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
any such differences between Lump and David. (For versions of this
worry, see Simons 1987: 225&ndash;6, Burke 1992, and Olson 2001. Note
that this concern is sometimes put in terms of
 <a href="../supervenience/">supervenience</a>,
 but is better framed in terms of
 <a href="../metaphysical-explanation/">metaphysical explanation</a>
 or
 <a href="../grounding/">grounding</a>&mdash;see
 Bennett 2004.)</p>

<p>
One natural response involves appealing to a difference in
<em>kind</em> (Wiggins 2001). Lump can survive being squashed or
rolled into a ball, since Lump is a mere lump of clay. But David is a
statue, and statues cannot survive these kinds of changes. This,
however, only pushes back the explanatory challenge: how could
intrinsic duplicates like Lump and David differ in kind? One option
would be to appeal to <em>relational</em> differences. For example,
Lynne Rudder Baker suggests that David&mdash;unlike Lump&mdash;is a
statue because it is essentially related to an artworld&mdash;it is
the sort of thing that critics admire, review, and discuss (Baker
2000: 35&ndash;46). The problem is that this seems to get things
backwards, for it is natural to think that David is admired, reviewed,
and discussed <em>because it is a statue</em> (rather than a mere lump
of clay). A related idea is to explain the difference in kind by
appealing to differences in <em>historical</em> facts (Burke 1992:
15). For example, one might say that Lump is a mere lump of clay
because it was created by a claymaker whose intent was to create a
lump, whereas David was created by a sculptor whose intent was to
create a statue. One worry is that this line of response cannot be
extended to every case of constitution. For example, Alan Gibbard
(1975) imagines an artist who sculpts a statue in two
pieces&mdash;bottom and top&mdash;and then joins them together,
simultaneously creating a statue (&lsquo;Goliath&rsquo;) and a new
piece of clay (&lsquo;Lumpl&rsquo;). Sometime later, the artist
smashes the statue to bits, thereby destroying both the statue and the
lump. The crucial feature of this case is that Lumpl and Goliath share
their historical properties and appear to stand in the same relations
to everything around them&mdash;both are created by the same person
(at the same time), put on display in the same galleries, and so on.
In short, Lumpl and Goliath share all their relational properties
while still differing in kind, in which case the explanatory challenge
remains unmet. (For further discussion of the grounding problem and
alternative replies, see DeRosset 2011, Einheuser 2011, Sutton 2012,
Saenz 2015, and Koslicki 2018.)</p>

<p>
A final worry for the constitution view concerns arbitrariness or
anthropic reasoning. (For different versions of this worry, see Sosa
1987, Sider 2001: 156&ndash;8, and Fairchild 2022.) The constitution
view claims that it is possible for two material objects&mdash;like
David and Lump&mdash;to be in the same place at the same time. But why
stop at <em>two</em>? Consider the <em>mereological sum</em> of
David&rsquo;s fundament physical particles. Those particles existed
long before David or Lump were created, so the sum would appear to be
another object in addition to the statue and the lump. But why stop at
<em>three</em>? Consider the <em>instatue</em> that coincides with
David whenever that statue is indoors and then goes out of existence
whenever David is taken outside (cf. Hirsch 1982: 32). There is also
the tablestatue (that exists only when the statue is on a table), the
litstatue (that exists only when the statue is in the light), the
dinnerstatue (that exists only when the statue&rsquo;s sculptor is
eating dinner), and so on. Ernest Sosa (1987) refers to this
multiplication of entities as &ldquo;the explosion of
reality&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Defenders of the constitution view may try to run from the explosion
and insist that there are only two (or three, or four) objects in the
same place at the same time. But what could justify this exclusionary
attitude? Granted, we do not normally <em>concern</em> ourselves with
instatues, litstatues, and the rest. Ordinary English does not even
have sortal terms for <em>discussing</em> these entities. But these
are facts about our interests and linguistic decisions. Why should we
think that there is a correspondence between the <em>sortal terms</em>
in our language and the <em>kinds of objects</em> in the world? One
way to explain this correspondence would be to claim that reality is
determined, in some sense, by our conceptual scheme. But the
constitution view is normally offered as an <em>alternative</em> to
anti-realist views of this kind. Perhaps, then, the constitution
theorist should accept Sosa&rsquo;s explosion and say that our
inattentiveness does not exclude things like instatues and litstatues
from the realm of being? (Yablo 1987, Bennett 2004, Hawthorne 2006,
Fairchild 2019, Dorr et al. 2022)? Perhaps. But this brings us very
close to adopting the next view of material constitution. (For other

<h2><a id="TemPar">3. Temporal Parts</a></h2>

<p>
According to the <em>temporal parts theory</em> (or
<em>four-dimensionalism</em>), persistence through time is like
extension in space (Quine 1953, Lewis 1976, Sider 2001). Objects
extend through space by having different parts in different places; in
the same way, objects persist through time by having different
<em>temporal parts</em> at different times. A temporal part is a
genuine <em>part</em> of something which <em>overlaps</em> every part
of that entity during some period, but exists <em>only</em> during
that period. In this respect, it is like one of the many road segments
that make up an extended roadway. (For a more detailed statement of
the view, see the entry on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Consider now the case of State Route 9A, which runs from Peekskill, NY
to the southern tip of Manhattan. As one drives south, this roadway
eventually &ldquo;turns into&rdquo; the West Side Highway, which is
wholly located within New York City. The two roads in this case are
not the same, but they are <em>partly</em> identical, since the West
Side Highway is a proper spatial part of the longer state route.
According to the temporal parts theorist, something analogous is the
case with Lump and David. In that scenario, the piece of clay exists
for some period of time and is then &ldquo;turned into&rdquo; a
statue, with the result that David is a proper temporal part of the
longer-lived Lump.</p>

<p>
One way to motivate this understanding of material constitution is to
compare it with the constitution view.</p>

<p>
The first problem for the constitution view was that it allowed for
two material objects to be in the same place at the same time. The
temporal parts theorist avoids this objection since he says that,
whenever Lump and David exist, there is a single object that exactly
occupies the relevant location&mdash;a temporal part that is shared by
both David and Lump. Those two objects will be <em>partly</em> present
at the same location, but this is no more problematic than two roads
being partly present at the same place by sharing a common road
segment.</p>

<p>
The second problem for the constitution view was that it allowed for
two objects to be composed of all the same parts. The temporal parts
theorist avoids this problem as well, since he will say that Lump and
David share some but not all of the same temporal parts. Those objects
<em>will</em> have all the same parts whenever they both exist, but
this is no more problematic than two roads sharing all the same parts
where they overlap.</p>

<p>
The third challenge for the constitution theorist was to ground the
differences between coincident objects. The same challenge can be put
to the friend of temporal parts: in virtue of what do David and Lump
have different kind properties, persistence conditions, and the like?
In response, one could point out that these objects share all of the
same parts whenever they both exist, but that Lump, for example,
exists at times that David does not. The four-dimensionalist will
claim that this gives us a difference in temporal parts, which could
help to explain the other differences in question (Wasserman
2002).</p>

<p>
The last worry for the constitution view was that it postulated a
mysterious connection between the sortal terms of our language and the
kinds of objects in the world. The temporal parts theorist avoids this
worry as well. On the standard four-dimensionalist picture, persisting
objects are ultimately composed of instantaneous temporal parts and,
for any collection of these parts, there is a further object they
compose (Quine 1960: 171). For example, there is an object consisting
of all and only the temporal parts of David <em>when that statue is
indoors</em>. This would be what we earlier called an
&ldquo;instatue&rdquo;. There is also an object composed of all and
only the temporal parts of David <em>when that statue is in the
light</em>. This is what we earlier called a &ldquo;litstatue&rdquo;.
In this way, the temporal parts theorist finds a place for all the
objects introduced earlier, and thereby avoids an implausible
correlation between the sortal terms of our language and the kinds of
objects in the world. (Of course, some people think that this solution
is worse than the problem&mdash;see, for example, Markosian 1998: 228,
Elder 2008: 440, and Korman 2015: Chapter 4.)</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the temporal parts solution cannot be extended to
Gibbard&rsquo;s case of Lumpl and Goliath since those objects exist at
all of the same times and therefore share all the same temporal parts.
If sameness of parts means sameness of object, it would follow that
Lumpl is identical to Goliath. This, however, is problematic, since
those objects seem to differ in their modal properties. Lumpl, for
example, could survive beings squashed, whereas Goliath could not.</p>

<p>
One reply to this worry is suggested by David Lewis (1971, 1986), who
defends a <em>counterpart theory</em> of modality. According to Lewis,
ordinary objects like Goliath exist in only one possible world, but
have <em>counterparts</em> at other worlds that serve as truth-makers
for <em>de re</em> modal claims. Crucially, whether or not something
counts as a counterpart of Goliath (for example) will depend on what
respects of similarity are at issue. Since the name
&lsquo;Goliath&rsquo; is associated with the kind <em>statue</em>, a
sentence like &ldquo;Goliath could survive being squashed&rdquo; will
normally be true (relative to a context) just in case Goliath has some
<em>statue</em>-counterparts that survive squashing (i.e., some
counterparts that survive squashing <em>as statues</em>). Presumably,
there are no such counterparts, so that sentence will express a
falsehood. Meanwhile, the name &lsquo;Lumpl&rsquo; is associated with
the kind <em>lump of clay</em>, so a sentence like &ldquo;Lumpl could
survive being squashed&rdquo; will be true just in case Lumpl has a
<em>lump</em>-counterpart that survives being squashed. Presumably,
there are some such objects at other worlds, so that sentence will
express a truth. Moreover, this will be the case even if the temporal
parts theorist is correct and a single object is picked out by both
&lsquo;Lumpl&rsquo; and &lsquo;Goliath&rsquo;. The key point is that
the phrase &lsquo;could survive being squashed&rsquo; expresses
different properties when combined with these names, so
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law has no application. (For more on counterpart
theory, see section 8 of the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lewis-metaphysics/index.html#Counter">David Lewis&rsquo;s metaphysics</a>.
 For a somewhat related idea, see Gallois 1998. For a very different
approach, see Wallace 2019.)</p>

<p>
One worry for this response is that it cannot account for apparent
non-modal differences between Lumpl and Goliath. For example, Kit Fine
(2003) argues that Lumpl, but not Goliath, might be
<em>well-made</em>, and that Goliath, but not Lumpl, might be
<em>Romanesque</em>. Since these are not modal ascriptions,
counterpart theory has no application. As a result, it is unclear what
the temporal parts theorist is to say about these differences. (For
more on this issue, see the exchange between Fine 2006, Frances 2006,
and King 2006; see also Almotahari 2014.)</p>

<h2><a id="Eli">4. Eliminativism</a></h2>

<p>
The simplest way of avoiding the puzzles of material constitution is
to deny the existence of some of the objects that give rise to those
problems. For example, if one claims that there are no such things as
statues and lumps of clay, then there is no threat of having a statue
and a lump of clay in the same place at the same time.</p>

<p>
This kind of eliminativism is often associated with Peter Unger
(1979), who once defended the thesis of <em>mereological
nihilism</em>. Nihilism is the view that there are there are no
composite objects&mdash;only atoms exist. On this view, there may be
quarks or electrons, but there are are no statues, animals or other
macroscopic objects composed of those particles. Since the nihilist
denies the existence of statues in general, he will deny the existence
of the particular statue, David. Hence, he will reject the very first
premise of the original argument for coincident objects. (Note that
Unger&rsquo;s use of &lsquo;nihilism&rsquo; differs slightly from how
it used in the subsequent literature. On this point, see van Inwagen
1990: 73. This view also differs from the nihilistic picture on which
there are no individuals at the fundamental level of reality. On the
latter view, see O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne and Cortens 1995, Dasgupta
2009, and Turner 2011.)</p>

<p>
The nihilist makes two main claims, both of which can be challenged.
First, there is the negative thesis that there are no composite
objects and no statues in particular. The most common reaction to this
is an incredulous stare&mdash;for many, the existence of composite
objects is a Moorean fact, more certain than any premise which could
be used to argue against it. The nihilist may reply that we can make
sense of our statue-talk by paraphrasing it into claims about simples.
For example, instead of saying that there is a statue on the table, we
can say that there are some simples arranged &ldquo;statuewise&rdquo;
on top of some other simples arranged &ldquo;tablewise&rdquo;. (For
more on this paraphrasing strategy, see van Inwagen 1990: Chapter 10.
For worries, see O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne and Michael 1996, Uzquiano
2004b, and McGrath 2005.) This brings us to the nihilist&rsquo;s
positive thesis that there are material simples. This claim can also
be challenged. After all, it was once thought that chemical atoms were
fundamental particles, until the discovery of protons and neutrons. So
too, it was thought that protons and neutrons were mereological
simples, until the discovery of quarks. One might think that this
process could go on forever, in which case our world would be
<em>gunky</em> (i.e., it would have no simples as proper parts). The
problem is that this possibility is inconsistent with nihilism, which
requires a material world to include material simples (Sider 1993,
Zimmerman 1996, Schaffer 2003).</p>

<p>
A second version of eliminativism is associated with Peter van Inwagen
(1990), who defends the view that living things are the only composite
objects. This view is closely related to nihilism, but has one notable
advantage&mdash;it allows for the existence of human persons. For
example, in the case of Dion and Theon, van Inwagen will say that Dion
exists at the beginning of the story, since the activity of the
relevant simples constitutes a life (the life of Dion). But van
Inwagen will deny that Theon exists, for the activity of the relevant
simples only constitutes a <em>part</em> of Dion&rsquo;s life at that
time. The activity of those same simples constitutes a life after
Dion&rsquo;s right foot is removed, at which point the simples come to
compose Dion. More generally, van Inwagen denies what he calls
&ldquo;the doctrine of arbitrary undetached parts&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent">
<em>The Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts</em> (DAUP): For every
material object <em>m</em>, time <em>t</em>, and regions
<em>r</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>, if <em>m</em>
occupies <em>r</em><sub>1</sub> at <em>t</em> and
<em>r</em><sub>2</sub> is a sub-region of <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, then
there is a part of <em>m</em> that occupies <em>r</em><sub>2</sub> at
<em>t</em>. (cf. van Inwagen 1981: 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(For more on DAUP and material constitution, see Olson 1995, Parsons
2004, and Carmichael 2022.)</p>

<p>
Van Inwagen&rsquo;s version of eliminativism is subject to the same
objections raised against nihilism, but it also faces problems of its
own. Here is one. There are borderline cases where it is vague whether
or not the activity of some simples constitutes a life (consider, for
example, the question of when, exactly, a person&rsquo;s life comes to
an end). But, if it is vague whether the activity of some simples
constitutes a life then, according to van Inwagen, it is vague how
many objects exist. However, it cannot be vague how many objects
exist, since cardinality claims can be made in a part of language
where nothing is vague. Suppose that there are exactly one-million
simples and that it is vague whether or not the activity of those
simples constitutes a life. Now consider the numerical sentence that
asserts the existence of (at least) one-million and one objects. (A
<em>numerical sentence</em> is a first-order sentence asserting the
existence of some objects. For example, the numerical sentence that
there exist at least two objects is:
&exist;<em>x</em>&exist;<em>y</em>(<em>x</em> &ne; <em>y</em>).) If
van Inwagen is correct, then it is indeterminate whether or not the
relevant numerical sentence is true, in which case one of the
constituent expressions&mdash;&lsquo;&exist;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>y</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;~&rsquo;,
&lsquo;=&rsquo;&mdash;must be vague. Yet philosophers have claimed
that the terms of first-order logic do not admit of borderline cases.
(For a more detailed presentation of this argument, see Lewis 1986:
212&ndash;213, Sider 2001: 120&ndash;132, and section 2.2 of the entry
on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ordinary-objects/#VagCom">ordinary objects</a>.
 For potential replies, see van Inwagen 1990: Chapter 19, Hirsch 2002,
and Koslicki 2003.)</p>

<p>
A third version of eliminativism is often associated with Roderick
Chisholm (1973), who defends the doctrine of <em>mereological
essentialism</em>: for any <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> is
a part of <em>y</em> then, necessarily, <em>y</em> exists only if
<em>x</em> is a part of <em>y</em>. This doctrine is an
&ldquo;eliminativist&rdquo; view insofar as it denies the existence of
mereologically ductile objects. For example, in the Ship of Theseus
case it is natural to think that there is a ship which survives the
replacement of at least some of its parts. The essentialist&rsquo;s
response to the paradox is to deny this apparent truism. In the same
way, the Debtor&rsquo;s Paradox and the Puzzle of Deon and Theon only
arise on the assumption that human persons can gain and lose parts.
The essentialist solves these puzzles by rejecting this assumption.
The Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay remains problematic, however,
for that example only involves a change in shape. In order to respond
to this puzzle, the essentialist can endorse a related principle: for
any <em>x</em>s and for any <em>y</em>, if the <em>x</em>s compose
<em>y</em> then, necessarily, the <em>x</em>s exist only if they
compose <em>y</em>. This thesis says that the whole is essential to
the parts, so that whenever you have the same constituents, you have
the same whole. The defender of this thesis will say that, in our
earlier case, Lump exists on both Monday and Tuesday, for the same
clay parts are present on both days. The same is true of David. The
parts that compose David on Tuesday are present on Monday, in which
case the first premise of the earlier argument is false&mdash;David
<em>did</em> exist on Monday (just not as a statue). In that case, the
defender of mereological essentialism is free to identify David and
Lump and thereby avoid any commitment to coincident objects.</p>

<p>
Viewed from one perspective, the essentialist&rsquo;s picture seems
intuitive. When one rearranges the dining room furniture, one does not
bring new furniture into existence&mdash;one simply brings existing
furniture into a new arrangement. In the same way, sculpting some clay
provides a new form, but does not create a new object. Viewed from
another perspective, however, this picture seems completely absurd,
for it implies that if we annihilate a single particle of David, the
entire statue will be destroyed. More frightening still, if we
annihilate a single particle from your body, then <em>you</em> will no
longer exist. The mereological essentialist may reply that, if we were
to annihilate a particle from David, there would still be a statue
left in its place&mdash;call it <em>David*</em>. David* would not be
<em>identical</em> to David, but it would be very similar. For
example, it would have roughly the same mass, shape, and location. In
Chisholm&rsquo;s terminology, this would be a
&ldquo;statue-successor&rdquo; of David, and the existence of this
successor provides a loose sense in which &ldquo;the statue&rdquo;
survives. Here is a second worry for the essentialist, focusing on the
idea that the whole is essential to the parts. Imagine that the artist
who sculpted David becomes dissatisfied with her work and squashes the
statue while preserving all the bits of clay. If the whole is
essential to the parts, then it would follow that David (the thing
that was previously composed of those parts) still exists. But this
seems absurd&mdash;statues cannot survive being squashed. We get an
equally absurd result in the opposite direction. David&rsquo;s parts
existed prior to the sculpting, so David itself existed at that time.
But how could a statue exist before it was sculpted? The eliminativist
might reply that the thing which is currently a statue existed prior
to the sculpting, but that it was not then a statue. In this sense, at
least, we can say that the statue did not exist prior to sculpting.
Similarly, the thing which is currently a statue may survive being
squashed, but it will no longer be a statue at that point. In that
sense, the statue will not survive the squashing. (For more on this
paraphrasing strategy, see Chisholm 1976: Chapter 3. A related move is
made by so-called <em>phasalists</em> who take ordinary sortals like
&lsquo;statue&rsquo; and &lsquo;lump of clay&rsquo; to be phase
sortals akin to &lsquo;child&rsquo; and &lsquo;teenager&rsquo;. See,
e.g., Schwartz 2009, Biro 2018, and Mooney 2023.)</p>

<h2><a id="DomKin">5. Dominant Kinds</a></h2>

<p>
In the previous section, we examined various ways of resisting the
first premise of our argument<em>&mdash;</em>the claim that <em>David
did not exist on Monday</em>. Let us now turn to the suggestion that
<em>Lump did exist on Monday</em>. Eliminativists like Unger and van
Inwagen will reject this premise, since they deny the existence of
objects like Lump. But there are other accounts that reject this
premise as well. One such theory is the <em>dominant kind view</em> of
Michael Burke (1994, 1997a, 1997b).</p>

<p>
Burke begins with the assumption that there is a single object present
on Tuesday. For the moment, call this object &ldquo;Rex&rdquo;. Burke
assumes that Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue. This is a
perfectly natural assumption, but it is also problematic. As we have
seen, kinds are associated with different persistence conditions. For
example, unlike the kind <em>statue</em>, the kind <em>lump of
clay</em> is associated with the property of <em>being able to survive
squashing</em>. Now consider the following principle: for any object
<em>o</em> and kind <em>K</em>, if <em>o</em> is a <em>K</em>, then
<em>o</em> has the persistence conditions associated with <em>K</em>
(Burke 1994: 598). Since Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue, this
principle tells us that it is able to survive squashing and that it is
not. Burke concludes that the proposed principle is false&mdash;it is
possible for an object to be a <em>K</em> without having the
persistence conditions associated with that kind. In particular, Burke
claims that an object only has the persistence conditions associated
with its <em>dominant</em> kind. For Burke, a dominant kind is one
which &ldquo;entails possession of the widest range of
properties&rdquo; (Burke 1994: 607). For example, if something is a
lump of clay, it must have certain <em>physical</em> properties,
whereas a statue must have both physical <em>and</em> aesthetic
properties. In this sense, <em>statue</em> entails a wider range of
properties than <em>lump of clay</em>. For that reason, Rex has the
persistence conditions associated with the kind <em>statue</em>. Rex,
in other words, is just David. What about Lump? In the original story,
the name &lsquo;Lump&rsquo; was introduced for the lump of clay that
exists on Monday. At that point there was no statue, so Lump&rsquo;s
dominant kind was simply <em>lump of clay</em>. Let us now introduce
the name &lsquo;Lump*&rsquo; for the lump that exists on Tuesday. The
lump of clay that exists on Tuesday is also a statue (Lump* is David,
i.e., Rex), so Lump*&rsquo;s dominant kind is <em>statue</em>. Hence,
Lump &ne; Lump*. On Burke&rsquo;s view, the process of sculpting a
lump of clay into a statue destroys one object (a mere lump of clay)
and replaces it with another (a statue). The resulting entity is also
a lump of clay, but it is numerically distinct from the lump of clay
with which we began.</p>

<p>
The dominant kinds view has several advantages over the eliminativist
accounts. Most notably, it recognizes the existence of ordinary
objects like statues and lumps of clay, while also allowing for those
objects to gain and lose parts. However, some of the objections raised
in previous sections also apply to Burke&rsquo;s account. For example,
the anthropic objection from section 2 can be raised against the
dominant kinds view (Sider 2001: 165). The view also faces problems of
its own.</p>

<p>
First, there is the objection from commonsense. According to Burke,
sculptors can destroy lumps of clay by doing nothing more than
reshaping them in accordance with certain artistic intentions. In
fact, given certain theories of what constitutes an artwork, the
sculptor doesn&rsquo;t even have to do that much. Suppose that an
artist takes a liking to a particular rock and titles it
<em>Rocky</em>, inviting art critics to admire his new work. If this
is all it takes to create an artpiece, then that is all it takes to
destroy a rock. After all, the rock at the beginning of the story has
<em>piece of rock</em> as its dominant kind, whereas the rock at the
end has <em>piece of art</em> as its dominant kind. Hence, the latter
rock is numerically distinct from the former. This seems absurd. Burke
replies by appealing to ambiguity (1994: 596&ndash;7). According to
him, &lsquo;the rock&rsquo; could denote <em>the rock</em> (a singular
object) or <em>the rocky stuff</em> (the matter that constitutes that
object). On the first reading, the rock from the beginning of the
story is <em>not</em> the same but, on the second reading, it is
(since there is the same matter throughout). Burke suggests that this
is enough to satisfy the demands of commonsense. (For more on mass
terms and the distinction between stuff and things, see the entry on
 <a href="../metaphysics-massexpress/">the metaphysics of mass expressions</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
A second problem concerns Burke&rsquo;s account of dominance. He
claims that one kind dominates another just in case it entails a wider
range of properties. This seems to get the current case correct, for
there is a natural sense in which <em>statue</em> entails a wider
range of properties than <em>lump of clay</em>. But now consider the
case of a performance artist who poses his own body to form a statue.
Here, the relevant object is both a person and a statue. The kind
<em>statue</em> entails having certain aesthetic properties, but does
not entail having any mental properties. Meanwhile, the kind
<em>person</em> arguably entails having certain mental properties, but
does not entail having any aesthetic ones. But, in that case, neither
kind dominates the other, so Burke&rsquo;s account seems incomplete.
(For further discussion of this worry, see Rea 2000.)</p>

<p>
A final problem is that the dominant kinds view cannot be extended to
all cases of constitution. For example, in the Ship of Theseus story,
we seem to have two ships in the same place at the same time. Since
there is a <em>single</em> kind at issue, Burke&rsquo;s account does
not apply. (For further examples of this kind, see Fine 2000.)</p>

<h2><a id="RelIde">6. Relative Identity</a></h2>

<p>
In the previous two sections, we discussed various ways of challenging
the first two premises of the argument for coincident objects. Let us
now turn our attention to the third: <em>If David did not exist on
Monday and Lump did exist on Monday, then David is not identical to
Lump</em>. This claim follows from Leibniz&rsquo;s Law which says
that, for any <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> is identical to
<em>y</em>, then <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> share all of the same
properties. So, denying this principle is one way of resisting the
third premise.</p>

<p>
The denial of Leibniz&rsquo;s Law is sometimes associated with Peter
Geach (1962, 1967), who defends a view called <em>the relative
identity theory</em>. Geach&rsquo;s central thesis is that there is no
relation of absolute identity&mdash;sameness is always <em>relative to
a</em> <em>kind</em>. Thus, we can say that David is the same
<em>statue</em> as Lump and we can say that David is the same <em>lump
of clay</em> as Lump, but it makes no sense to ask if David is the
same as Lump <em>simpliciter</em>. The consequent of the third premise
is therefore nonsense, like saying &lsquo;David is not taller
than&rsquo;. More generally, Geach rejects the standard formulation of
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law as incomplete, since it includes a non-relativized
identity predicate.</p>

<p>
Geach makes many interesting claims about the behavior of relative
identity relations. For example, he claims that it is possible for
<em>a</em> to be the same <em>K</em> as <em>b</em>, but not the same
<em>K</em>*, where &lsquo;<em>K</em>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<em>K</em>*&rsquo; are sortal terms denoting different kinds.
Take, for example, the Debtor&rsquo;s Paradox. In that case, we have
an earlier portion of matter, M1, and a later portion of matter M2.
According to Geach, M1 is not the same portion of matter as M2, but it
is the same person. In this way, he is able to allow for persistence
through change in parts. (For further details, see the entry on
 <a href="../identity-relative/">relative identity</a>;
 for other versions of relativism, see Myro 1985 and Gallois
1998.)</p>

<p>
The relative identity theorist denies the standard formulation of
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, but there is significant pressure to accept
<em>some</em> version of that principle since it seems to capture a
central feature of identity. An obvious suggestion would be to say
that, for any <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> is the same K
as <em>y</em>, then <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> share all of the same
properties (where &lsquo;K&rsquo; denotes some kind). If Geach&rsquo;s
relative identity relations do not conform to this law, one might
worry that they are not <em>identity</em> relations at all. And here
we have a potential problem. Take the case of David and Lump. As we
have seen, some philosophers want to say that David is both a statue
and a lump of clay (it is not a <em>mere</em> lump of clay, since it
is also a statue, but it is still a lump). Since there is only one
lump of clay on Tuesday, David must be the same lump of clay as Lump.
But then, by the relativized version of Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, David and
Lump must share all of the same properties. Again, this seems
incorrect. In response, the relative identity theorist might appeal to
another component of Geach&rsquo;s view. Geach suggests that proper
names are always associated with kinds. For example,
&lsquo;David&rsquo; is associated with the kind <em>statue</em> and
&lsquo;Lump&rsquo; is associated with the kind <em>lump of clay</em>.
Taking a cue from the counterpart theorist (section 3), the relative
identity theorist could claim that this association creates opaque
contexts when ascribing certain properties. Consider the following
statements:</p>

<ol>

<li>Lump existed on Monday.</li>

<li>David existed on Monday.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The relative identity theorist could say that (1) is true if and only
if there was a <em>lump of clay</em> on Monday which is the same lump
of clay as Lump. (2), on the other hand, is true just in case there
was <em>statue</em> on Monday which is the same statue as David. Given
these truth conditions, (1) is true and (2) is false, for there was a
lump of clay on Monday (the same one as Lump), but no statue. More
importantly, on this analysis the predicates in (1) and (2) express
different properties, in which case the relativized version of
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law has no application. So, one cannot move from (1)
and the negation of (2) to the conclusion that Lump and David are
distinct lumps of clay.</p>

<p>
A second worry for Geach is that it seems as if the relative identity
theory cannot solve all the puzzles with which we began. Take, once
again, the Ship of Theseus. In that case, we have the original ship of
Theseus (A), the museum&rsquo;s ship (B), and the custodian&rsquo;s
ship (C). The problem is that B seems to be the same ship as A, which
seems to be the same ship as C. If the <em>same ship as</em> relation
is transitive, we get the absurd conclusion that B is the same ship as
C. The relative identity theorist might deny transitivity, but this
would give us another reason to suspect that relativized identity
relations are not <em>identity</em> relations at all (Gupta 1980).</p>

<p>
A third and final worry for Geach concerns the denial of absolute
identity. As many commentators have pointed out, this seems to carry
important implications for logic, semantics, and set theory. To take
just one example, consider the set theorist&rsquo;s axiom of
<em>extensionality</em>: for any sets <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, if
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> have the same members, then <em>A</em> is
the same set as <em>B</em>. Let <em>A</em> be David&rsquo;s unit set
and <em>B</em> be Lump&rsquo;s. Is <em>A</em> the same set as
<em>B</em>? The relativist must reject this question as ill-formed. It
makes no sense to ask whether <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the same
members, since this requires a notion of absolute identity
(intuitively, &lsquo;member&rsquo; does not denote a genuine kind, so
&lsquo;same member as&rsquo; does not express a relative identity
relation). As a result, the relative identity theorist must deny
extensionality, which throws set theory into jeopardy (Hawthorne
2004).</p>

<h2><a id="Def">7. Deflationism</a></h2>

<p>
Imagine a debate between two friends over whether or not boats are
ships. One party points to a rowboat and says, &ldquo;That boat is a
ship. After all, a ship is a vessel that floats on water and the
rowboat is obviously such a vessel.&rdquo; The second party disagrees:
&ldquo;A ship is a sufficiently <em>large</em> vessel that floats on
water and the rowboat is not sufficiently large. So, the boat is not a
ship.&rdquo; Clearly, there is something defective about this debate.
First, there are two candidate meanings for
&lsquo;ship&rsquo;&mdash;namely <em>a vessel that floats on water</em>
and <em>a sufficiently large vessel that floats on water</em>. Second,
neither of these candidate meanings is more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; than
the other&mdash;unlike &lsquo;water&rsquo; or &lsquo;electron&rsquo;,
the predicate &lsquo;ship&rsquo; does not correspond to a natural kind
in the world. Third, the two parties to the debate agree on all of the
&ldquo;non-ship facts&rdquo;&mdash;in particular, they agree that the
rowboat is a vessel, that it floats on water, and that it is
relatively small in size. Given these points, it is tempting to say
that the two parties agree on all of the <em>facts</em> and that their
dispute is <em>merely verbal</em>. Note that this conclusion is
consistent with the view that one of the parties is mistaken. For
example, if the meanings of our terms are determined, in part, by the
broader community, then the first party to the debate is presumably
mistaken, since most English-speakers don&rsquo;t use
&lsquo;ship&rsquo; in this way. Still, there is a sense in which the
debate is verbal since there is another possible language
(&ldquo;English*&rdquo;) that (a) employs a different, equally natural
meaning for &lsquo;ship&rsquo;, (b) is adequate for describing all of
the facts, and (c) is such that the first party&rsquo;s statement
would be true in that language. Thus, we might say that the real
dispute between the two parties is over whether or not English is
English*.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers have suggested that the debate over material
constitution is defective in much the same way. There is no genuine
dispute between Lewis and Unger, for example, over whether or not
statues exist. Both parties agree on all of the relevant
non-linguistic facts&mdash;e.g., that there are simples arranged
statuewise. Moreover, both parties agree that there are two possible
languages (&ldquo;Lewis-English&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Unger-English&rdquo;) where the sentence &ldquo;Statues
exist&rdquo; would come out true in one and false in the other. So the
only disagreement is about whether English is Lewis-English or
Unger-English. In other words, the debate is merely verbal. This kind
of <em>deflationism</em> is often associated with Rudolf Carnap
(1950), Hilary Putnam (1987) and, more recently, Eli Hirsch (2002,
2011). The issues raised by deflationism are extremely complicated;
here, we will limit ourselves to a few initial observations. (For
further discussion, see Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman 2009, Hirsch
2011, and Thomasson 2015.)</p>

<p>
In the imagined dispute, we know exactly what the disputed term is
(&lsquo;ship&rsquo;) and exactly what the relevant meanings are (<em>a
vessel that floats on water</em> and <em>a sufficiently large vessel
that floats on water</em>). In the actual dispute between Lewis and
Unger, matters are less clear. One might suspect that the disputed
term is &lsquo;statue&rsquo;, but it turns out to be fairly difficult
to specify the relevant candidate meanings. For example, we might say
that, in Lewis-English, &lsquo;statue&rsquo; simply means <em>a
collection of simples arranged statuewise</em>. Whether or not that is
a plausible interpretation of what Lewis means depends in part on the
meaning of &lsquo;collection&rsquo; (Sider 2009: 388&ndash;90). In any
case, it is even more difficult to specify an appropriate candidate
meaning for &lsquo;statue&rsquo; in Unger-English. More importantly,
even if we are able to specify the relevant meanings, we will not have
shown that the dispute is verbal, since the disagreement can be stated
without using the word &lsquo;statue&rsquo; (or any non-logical
predicate, for that matter). Consider a world that contains
one-million simples arranged statuewise and nothing else disjoint from
these atoms. And consider the numerical sentence (see section 4 above)
which asserts the existence of at least one-million and one things.
Lewis and Unger will disagree over the truth of that sentence. But
that sentence contains only logical vocabulary. Hence, if the two
parties are really talking past each other, they must assign different
meanings to their logical constants.</p>

<p>
The most plausible suggestion is that Lewis and Unger assign (or, at
least, intend to assign) different meanings to the existential
quantifier, &lsquo;&exist;&rsquo;, as well as quantificational phrases
like &lsquo;there are&rsquo;, &lsquo;there is&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;some&rsquo;. This is where deflationists have focused their
attention. Putnam, for example, writes that &ldquo;[T]he logical
primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object and
existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one absolute
&lsquo;meaning&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; (1987: 71). This
thesis&mdash;that there are many meanings for the existential
quantifier that are equally natural and adequate for describing all
the facts&mdash;is often referred to as &ldquo;the doctrine of
quantifier variance&rdquo; (Hirsch 2002). What exactly are the
candidate meanings in question? Once again, matters are not so clear.
Lewis could, of course, simply interpret Unger to be using a
<em>restricted</em> quantifier that ranges only over simples. On that
interpretation, Unger speaks truthfully when he says &ldquo;Statues do
not exist&rdquo;, since there are no statues among the simples. The
problem with this interpretation is that it seems manifestly
implausible, given that Unger will insist that his quantifiers are to
be understood as unrestricted. Even more worrying is the question of
how Unger is supposed to interpret Lewis. He cannot, for example, say
that Lewis is using a less restrictive quantifier, for that would be
to say that there are things (that Lewis&rsquo;s quantifier ranges
over) that do not exist (by Unger&rsquo;s own lights). Unger could,
perhaps, take a more holistic approach and interpret Lewis&rsquo;s
assertion to mean <em>there are some simples arranged statuewise</em>.
More generally, Unger could interpret Lewis by replacing singular
quantifiers over composites with plural quantifiers over simples, and
by replacing each predicate of composites with an irreducibly plural
predicate of simples. Once again, we should expect protest&mdash;Lewis
will reject the proposed translation and insist that he is using
singular quantification.</p>

<p>
These initial observations bring out one disanalogy between the
ontological debate and paradigm verbal disputes. In the earlier
argument over whether or not boats are ships, the proposed
translations are <em>friendly</em>, since the first party will admit
that he uses &lsquo;ship&rsquo; to mean <em>a vessel that floats on
water</em> and the second will grant that he uses &lsquo;ship&rsquo;
to mean <em>a sufficiently large vessel that floats on water</em>.
Given this disambiguation, the dispute will evaporate. The
deflationist&rsquo;s proposals are instead <em>hostile</em>, for
neither Lewis nor Unger will accept the deflationist interpretation
(Sider 2009: section 5). This does not mean that the
ontologists&rsquo; debate is non-verbal, but it does mean that the
issues involved are more complicated than those in paradigm verbal
disputes. (For further concerns about quantifier variance, see the
exchange between Dorr 2014, Warren 2015, 2021, and Sider 2023.)</p>
