<h1>Practical Reason</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Oct 13, 2003; substantive revision Wed Jul 31, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Practical reason is the general human capacity for resolving, through
reflection, the question of what one is to do. Deliberation of this
kind is practical in at least two senses. First, it is practical in
its subject matter, insofar as it is concerned with action. But it is
also practical in its consequences or its issue, insofar as reflection
about action itself directly moves people to act. Our capacity for
deliberative self-determination raises two sets of philosophical
problems. For one thing, there are questions about how deliberation
can succeed in being practical in its issue. What do we need to
assume&mdash;both about agents and about the processes of reasoning
they engage in&mdash;to make sense of the fact that deliberative
reflection can directly give rise to action? Can we do justice to this
dimension of practical reason while preserving the idea that practical
deliberation is genuinely a form of reasoning? For another, there are
large issues concerning the content of the standards that are brought
to bear in practical reasoning. Which norms for the assessment of
action are binding on us as deliberating agents? Do these norms
provide resources for critical reflection about our ends, or are they
exclusively instrumental? Under what conditions do moral norms yield
valid standards for reasoning about action? The first set of issues is
addressed in sections &sect;&sect;1&ndash;3 of the present article,
while sections &sect;&sect;4&ndash;6 cover the second set of
issues.</p>

<h2><a name="PraTheRea">1. Practical and Theoretical Reason</a></h2>

<p>
Practical reason defines a distinctive standpoint of reflection. When
agents deliberate about action, they think about themselves and their
situation in characteristic ways. What are some of the salient
features of the practical point of view?</p>

<p>
A natural way to interpret this point of view is to contrast it with
the standpoint of theoretical reason. The latter standpoint is
occupied when we engage in reasoning that is directed at the
resolution of questions that are in some sense theoretical rather than
practical; but how are we to understand this opposition between the
theoretical and the practical? One possibility is to understand
theoretical reflection as reasoning about questions of explanation and
prediction. Looking backward to events that have already taken place,
it asks why they have occurred; looking forward, it attempts to
determine what is going to happen in the future. Theoretical
reasoning, understood along these lines, finds paradigmatic expression
in the natural and social sciences. By extension, it also covers
matters of non-causal explanation, which are explored in the
philosophical disciplines that focus metaphysical, logical and
conceptual questions. In these ways, theoretical reflection is
concerned with matters of fact and their explanation. Furthermore it
treats these issues in impersonal terms that are accessible (in
principle) to anyone.</p>

<p>
Practical reason, by contrast, takes a distinctively normative
question as its starting point. It typically asks, of a set of
alternatives for action none of which has yet been performed, what one
ought to do, or which option is best (or at least sufficiently)
supported by reasons. It is thus concerned not with matters of
empirical, metaphysical, or logical fact and their explanation, but
with matters of value or, more generally, with the normative
evaluation of action. In practical reasoning agents attempt to assess
and weigh their reasons for action, the considerations that speak for
and against alternative courses of action that are open to them.
Moreover they do this from a distinctively first-personal point of
view, one that is defined in terms of a practical predicament in which
they find themselves (either individually or collectively&mdash;people
sometimes reason jointly about what they should do together).</p>

<p>
There is, however, a different and arguably better way of
understanding the contrast between practical and theoretical reason,
stressing the parallels rather than the differences between the two
forms of reflection (see e.g. Berker 2013). According to this
interpretation, theoretical reflection too is concerned with a
normative rather than a merely descriptive question, namely with the
question of what one ought, or is permitted, to believe. It attempts
to answer this normative question by assessing and weighing reasons
for belief, the considerations that speak for and against the
particular conclusions one might draw about the way the world is.
Furthermore, it does this from a standpoint of first-personal
reflection: the stance of theoretical reasoning in this sense is the
committed stance of the believer, not the stance of detached
contemplation of one&rsquo;s beliefs themselves (Moran 2001; Boyle
2011). Seen in this way, the contrast between practical and
theoretical reason is essentially a contrast between two different
systems of norms: <em>practical</em> norms for the regulation of
action on the one hand, and <em>epistemic</em> norms for the
regulation of belief on the other. (For recent discussion of the
relations between these kinds of norms, see the contributions in
McHugh et al. 2018).</p>

<p>
Theoretical reason, interpreted along these lines, addresses the
considerations that recommend accepting particular claims as to what
is or is not the case. That is, it involves reflection with an eye to
the truth of propositions, and the reasons for belief in which it
deals are (at least paradigmatically) evidential considerations that
increase the likelihood of propositions. Practical reason, by
contrast, is concerned not with the credibility of beliefs but with
the desirability or choice-worthiness of actions. The reasons in which
it deals are considerations that contribute to making it the case that
actions are worthy of performance in some way. This difference in
subject matter corresponds to a further difference between the two
forms of reason, in respect of their consequences. Theoretical
reflection about what one ought to believe produces changes in
one&rsquo;s overall set of beliefs, whereas practical reason gives
rise to action; as noted above, it is practical not only in its
subject matter, but also in its issue.</p>

<p>
One way to develop this line of thought would be to treat reason in
all its forms as oriented toward the questions that it aims to settle
(Hieronymi 2005, 2021). There are questions that individuals face
about what to think, but also about what to do. In reasoning about
these questions, we mobilize considerations that bear directly on
them, a process that is brought to a conclusion by our forming the
beliefs or taking the actions that constitutively settle the questions
we initially faced. Theoretical and practical reason are similar in
that they involve capacities to resolve questions through reflection
on reasons; they differ, however, in the kinds of question they aim to
settle.</p>

<p>
Two observations should be made about the contrast between theoretical
and practical reason. First, one might be tempted to think that there
is a categorial difference in the consequences of theoretical and
practical reason, insofar as the former produces changes in our mental
states, whereas the latter gives rise to bodily movements. But it
would be misleading to contrast the two kinds of rational capacity in
these terms. Practical reason gives rise not to bodily movements per
se, but to intentional actions, which are processes with an essential
attitudinal component. It would thus be more accurate to characterize
the issue of both theoretical and practical reason as
<em>attitudes</em>; the difference is that the exercise of theoretical
reason leads to modifications of our beliefs, whereas the exercise of
practical <a>reason</a> leads to modifications of our intentions
(Harman 1986; Bratman 1987) &mdash;understanding intentions to include
not just plans for the future, but also intentions in action (cf. the
entry on
 <a href="../intention/">intention</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Second, it is important to be clear that in neither case do the
characteristic modifications of attitude occur infallibly. There is
room for irrationality both in the theoretical and the practical
domain, which in at least one prominent form involves a failure to
form the attitudes that one acknowledges to be called for by the
considerations one has reflected on (cf. Scanlon 2007). Thus a person
might end up reading a mystery novel for another hour, while at the
same time judging that they should go back to work on their paper for
the upcoming conference. Practical irrationality of this latter kind
is known as <em>akrasia</em>, incontinence, or weakness of will, and
its nature and even possibility are traditional subjects of
philosophical speculation in their own right (see also the entry on
 <a href="../weakness-will/">weakness of will</a>).
 If we assume that this strong kind of practical irrationality is
possible, however, then we must grant that practical reason, like
other capacities, is not necessarily successful. In other words,
deliberation about action generates appropriate intentions only
insofar as an agent is rational (Korsgaard 1996).</p>

<p>
Intentions and beliefs are not the only attitudes that are answerable
to reasons; emotions too have their reasons, understood as
considerations by reference to which they can be justified or
criticized. Thus it is appropriate or fitting for someone who is in
the presence of imminent danger to feel fear, and by the same token
fear is inapt or irrational if it is felt about something that is
known to be harmless. Though emotions are responsive to reasons,
however, we do not typically form or modify them through processes of
reflection or deliberation. Reflective modification of our beliefs and
intentions, by contrast, is common, and commonly understood to involve
an exercise of our capacities for theoretical and practical
reason.</p>

<p>
Reasoning is commonly taken to be an inferential process that takes as
input some attitudes of a subject, and yields as output the formation
or modification of other attitudes (Harman 1986). Inferential
processes of this kind are involved in the paradigmatic cases in which
we exercise our capacities for both theoretical and practical reason.
In the practical case, however, there is an interesting question about
how exactly to understand the outputs of our reasoning. On a narrow
conception, all reasoning is concerned with the formation or
modification of belief, and practical reasoning in particular is
concerned with the formation and modification of normative beliefs
about action. The adjustments in our intentions that result from such
reflection are not themselves conclusions of reasoning (Raz 2011: Ch.
7, 2022: Ch. 3). Agents who have resolved the question of what they
ought or have reason to do still have a question to settle, about what
they are going to do. But proponents of the narrow conception would
note that this further question is not one that is to be resolved
through reasoning: once one has figured out what one ought to do,
there is no practical <em>reasoning</em> left to be done.</p>

<p>
On a broader conception, practical reasoning concludes directly in
intentions. According to this view, we resolve through reasoning the
question of what we are going to do (Broome 2013: Ch. 14; McHugh and
Way 2022: Ch. 2). This can also be said about a third and even broader
conception according to which practical reasoning can conclude
directly in action (Dancy 2018; Tenenbaum 2020). This view &ndash;
which is often (though not uncontroversially, cf. Corcilius 2008)
associated with Aristotle &ndash; arguably goes beyond the traditional
picture of reasoning as inference, but recall that even those who take
actions to be conclusions of reasoning will think that they are such
conclusions only if and because they are intentional and thus have an
essentially attitudinal component.</p>

<p>
Proponents of each of these accounts of practical reasoning should
agree, however, that practical reason involves some capacity to modify
our intentions. This is implicit in the idea that there are rational
constraints on intentions to which we respond through our broadly
rational capacities, constraints that are violated (for instance) in
cases of akrasia. The question under dispute is whether we exercise
this capacity for the modification of our intentions through
reasoning, or in some other way.</p>

<p>
We distinguished two ways of understanding the contrast between
theoretical and practical reason. On the first, theoretical reason is
concerned with understanding descriptive facts and their explanation,
while practical reason is concerned with the normative assessment of
action and the generation of intentional action in light of it. This
conception arguably neglects the normative dimension of theoretical
reason, which in turn is emphasized by the second understanding.
According to it, while practical reason normatively assesses and
generates actions or practical attitudes in light of this assessment,
theoretical reason normatively assesses and generates beliefs or
doxastic attitudes in light of this assessment, where the norms in
case of theoretical reason are distinctively epistemic norms.</p>

<p>
Both of these understandings should be distinguished from a third one,
according to which neither theoretical nor practical reason is
particularly concerned with normative assessment at all. According to
this coherentist or structuralist conception, theoretical reason
pertains to the coherence of a subject&rsquo;s doxastic attitudes,
while practical reason pertains to the coherence of a subject&rsquo;s
practical attitudes (see esp. Broome 2013, 2021; and the entry on
 <a href="../rationality-structural/">structural rationality</a>).
 We come back to this position below in &sect;4.</p>

<h2><a name="NatNor">2. Naturalism and Normativity</a></h2>

<p>
The connection of practical reason with intentional action raises
large questions about its credentials as a capacity for genuine
reasoning. As noted above, intentional action is not mere bodily
movement, but reflects a distinctive attitude of the agent&rsquo;s,
<em>viz</em>., intention. To be in this kind of mental state is to
have a conception of action that guides one&rsquo;s bodily movements
as they unfold. Intention seems in this respect to be strikingly
unlike belief, which has a representational function. Beliefs aim to
fit the way the world is, so that if one discovers that the world is
not how one previously took it to be, one will acknowledge pressure to
modify one&rsquo;s belief in the relevant dimension (pressure to which
one will respond if one is not irrational). With intentions however
things seem crucially different in this respect (Smith 1987). The
intention to go shopping on Wednesday, for instance, is not a state
that would or should be abandoned upon ascertaining or confirming that
one has not (yet) gone shopping on Wednesday; rather a person with
such an intention will ordinarily try to bring the world into
alignment with the intention, by going shopping when Wednesday comes
around. Intentions are in this way more like an architect&rsquo;s
blueprints than like sketches of an already-completed structure
(Anscombe 1957; cf. Velleman 1989). Put in terms of an influential and
controversially discussed metaphor first introduced by Searle (1983),
beliefs have a &ldquo;mind-to-world direction of fit&rdquo;, while
intentions seem to have a &ldquo;world-to-mind direction of fit&rdquo;
(see Frost 2014 for a critical overview of different accounts of this
distinction).</p>

<p>
Reflection on this contrast between belief and intention has led some
philosophers to ask whether practical reason might not be something of
a misnomer. The difficulty, in a nutshell, is to make sense of the
suggestion that a genuinely rational process could by itself generate
states with the peculiar function of intentions. Reason seems a
capacity for cognitive operations, whereas intentions are
distinctively noncognitive states, insofar as they do not aim to
reflect independent facts of the matter about the way things happen to
be in the world (cf. Hume 1739: Bk. 2, Sec. 3.3).</p>

<p>
Expressivism represents one line of response to this skeptical worry
about practical reason. Accounts of this kind offer interpretations of
the normative language that figures prominently in practical
reflection. As was seen in section &sect;1, such reflection addresses
an agent&rsquo;s reasons for acting in one way or another. Such
conclusions are sometimes expressed in evaluative terms, as claims
about what it would be good to do (cf. Bittner 2023), or as deontic
conclusions about the actions that one ought to (or may) perform (cf.
Parfit 2011; Schmidt 2024); and they are, in any case, normative
judgements. According to the expressivist, however, normative
conclusions of these kinds do not represent genuine cognitive
achievements, judgments that are literally capable of being true or
false. Rather they give expression to desires, sentiments, plans, and
other pro-attitudes, the sorts of goal-directed noncognitive state
that move people to action. The expressivist contends that we can make
sense of the capacity of practical reason to generate states with the
peculiar structure and function of intentions only if normative
judgements are understood along these lines.</p>

<p>
Expressivism in this form suggests a naturalistic interpretation of
practical reason, one that may seem appropriate to the enlightened
commitments of the modern scientific world view. It is naturalistic
metaphysically, insofar as it makes no commitment to the objective
existence in the world of such allegedly questionable entities as
values, norms, or reasons for action. If normative and evaluative
claims do not represent genuine cognitive achievements, then their
legitimacy does not depend on our postulating a realm of normative
facts to which those claims must be capable of corresponding. It is
also naturalistic psychologically, insofar as it yields explanations
of intentional human behavior that are basically continuous with
explanations of the behavior of non-rational animals. In both the
human and the non-human case, behavior is understood as the causal
product of noncognitive attitudes, operating in conjunction with a
creature&rsquo;s factual representation of how things are in its
environment. The special sophistication of human agency may be traced
to the fact that humans have much more sophisticated linguistic
methods for giving voice to their motivating noncognitive attitudes.
Indeed, many contemporary expressivists would contend that these
expressive resources are sufficiently powerful that we can explain by
means of them the features of practical deliberation that initially
give it the appearance of a genuine form of reasoning (Blackburn 1998;
Gibbard 1990, 2003; Ridge 2014; see also the entry on
 <a href="../moral-cognitivism/">moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Other philosophers remain unimpressed with this naturalistic approach
to practical reason. One ground for dissatisfaction with it is the
following. The expressivist strategy relies on an initial contrast
between practical reflection on the one hand, and the genuine forms of
cognitive activity characteristic of theoretical reasoning on the
other. There has to be some important sense in which practical
discourse does not satisfy the standards of rationality that
distinguish authentic cognitive discourse in the literal sense;
otherwise the contention that normative discourse is expressive rather
than cognitive will lack any significant content. But the contrast
between theoretical and practical reflection required for this purpose
seems elusive. As we saw in section &sect;1 above, theoretical
reasoning, like practical reasoning, is plausibly understood to be a
normative enterprise. It traffics in epistemic reasons for belief,
after all, and such reasons are arguably no less normative than
practical reasons for action (Cuneo 2007; Kiesewetter 2022b). To the
extent that this is the case, theoretical and practical reason would
seem equally problematic from the naturalistic perspective. To
accommodate these points, the expressivist program may have to be
extended to theoretical reasoning, a project that encounters
challenges of its own (cf. Cuneo 2007; Schroeder 2008).</p>

<p>
A different ground for concern about expressivism has to do with the
distinction between normative judgment and intention. Expressivism
traditionally makes sense of the fact that practical reason is
practical in its issue by collapsing this distinction. Normative
reflection can bring about adjustments in our intentions because it
just is a set of operations on our intentions (or intention-like
practical states). Compliance with what we ordinarily think of as a
rational requirement, to bring our intentions into alignment with our
normative beliefs, is thus secured through a kind of conceptual fiat.
The result is that there is no room, on this position, for the
paradigmatic form of irrationality in practice represented by
<em>akrasia</em>, whereby agents fail to intend what they themselves
believe they ought to do. Expressivists might try to leave room for
this possibility by distinguishing between intentions and the
practical attitudes that are mobilized in practical thought about what
to do. But this threatens to leave the approach without an account of
the ability of normative thought to engage the will.</p>

<p>
Many of those who reject expressivism would endorse some variety of
realism about the subject matter of practical reason. The basic
commitment of realism in this domain is the idea that there are facts
of the matter about what we have reason to do that are prior to and
independent of our deliberations, to which those deliberations are
ultimately answerable. Theorists of this stripe picture practical
reason as a capacity for reflection about an objective body of
normative truths regarding action (Skorupski 2010; Parfit 2011;
Scanlon 2014). While many realists take normative truths to be
irreducibly normative, others hold that they can ultimately be reduced
to truths that are at least in principle subject to the natural
sciences (e.g., Smith 1994; Jackson 1998; Schroeder 2007a; see also
the entry on
 <a href="../normativity-metaethics/">normativity in metaethics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Since realists maintain a cognitivist interpretation of normative
judgements, they have an easier time than expressivists to explain the
possibility of akrasia. By the same token, they have a harder time
explaining how practical reason can issue in intentions (see section
&sect;3 for further discussion). An alternative
approach&mdash;different both from realism and from the kind of
expressivism sketched above&mdash;is Kantian constructivism (Korsgaard
1996, 1997). This approach denies that practical reason is a capacity
for reflection about an objective domain of independent normative
facts; but it equally rejects the expressivist&rsquo;s naturalistic
suspicion of normativity (but cf. Street 2008; M&uuml;ller 2020 for
versions of constructivism that are more favorable to naturalism).
According to the Kantian constructivist, practical reason is governed
by genuine normative constraints, which for Kant himself included the
hypothetical and categorical imperatives (cf. Kant 1785). But what
makes these constraints normative is precisely their relation to the
will of the agents whose decisions they govern. The principles of
practical reason are constitutive principles of rational agency,
binding on us insofar as we necessarily commit ourselves to complying
with them in willing anything at all (Korsgaard 2009; cf. Enoch 2006).
The realm of the normative, on this approach, is not pictured as a
body of truths or facts that are prior to and independent of the will;
rather, it is taken to be &lsquo;constructed&rsquo; by agents through
their own volitional activity (see also the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructivism-metaethics/">constructivism in metaethics</a>).</p>
 
<h2><a name="ReaMot">3. Reasons and Motivation</a></h2>

<p>
The capacity of practical reason to give rise to intentional action
divides even those philosophers who agree in rejecting the
expressivist strategy discussed above. Many such philosophers are
prepared to grant that there are facts and truths about practical
reasons, and to accept the cognitive credentials of discourse about
this distinctive domain of facts and truths. But they differ in their
accounts of the truth conditions of the normative claims that figure
in such discourse. We may distinguish the following two approaches.
The first of these, often referred to as internalism, holds that
reasons for action must be grounded in an agent&rsquo;s prior
motivations (Williams 1979; cf. Finlay 2009). According to this
influential position, a given agent <em>s</em> can have reason to do
<em>x</em> only if <em>x</em>-ing would speak to or advance some
element in <em>s</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;subjective motivational
set&rsquo;. There must be some rational connection between
<em>s</em>&rsquo;s <em>x</em>-ing and the subjective motivations to
which <em>s</em> is actually already subject; otherwise the claim that
<em>s</em> has reason to <em>x</em> must be rejected, as false or
incoherent. Behind this internalist position lies the idea that
practical reason is practical in its issue. Internalists contend that
we can make sense of the generation of new intentions through
reasoning only if we assume that such reasoning is conditioned by
motivational resources that are already to hand. Practical reason, on
the internalist account, is the capacity to work out the implications
of the commitments contained in one&rsquo;s existing subjective
motivational set; the upshot is that motivation is prior to practical
reason, and constrains it.</p>

<p>
Externalists reject this picture, contending that one can have reasons
for action that are independent of one&rsquo;s prior motivations. They
typically agree that practical reasoning is capable of generating new
motivations and actions. They agree, in other words, that if agent
<em>s</em> has reason to do <em>x</em>, it must be possible for
<em>s</em> to acquire the motivation to <em>x</em> through reflection
on the relevant reasons. But they deny that such reasoning must in any
significant way be constrained by <em>s</em>&rsquo;s subjective
motivations prior to the episode of reasoning. On this approach,
practical reason is not conceived as a capacity for working out the
implications of one&rsquo;s existing desires and commitments. Instead,
reasons are taken to be features of an agent&rsquo;s situation that
make actions objectively choiceworthy, and reflection on such reasons
can open up new motivational possibilities (Parfit 1997; Dancy 2000).
This disagreement is conventionally understood to be driven by
diverging approaches to the explanation of intentional action.
Internalists are impressed by the differences between intentions and
the cognitive states that figure in paradigmatic examples of
theoretical reasoning. Pointing to these differences, they ask how
practical reason can succeed in producing new intentions if it is not
based in something of the same basic psychological type: a motivation
or desire that is already part of the agent&rsquo;s subjective
motivational equipment. Many externalists find this contrast between
intentions and cognitive states overdrawn. They hold that we need to
postulate basic dispositions of normative responsiveness to account
for the capacity of theoretical reflection about reasons to affect our
beliefs, and question why these same dispositions cannot explain the
fact that practical reasoning is practical in its consequences.
Cognitive or not, intentions belong to the broad class of attitudes
that are sensitive to judgments, and this may account for the capacity
of practical reflection to generate new intentions (Scanlon 1998: Ch.
1). A third possibility is that intentions result from dispositions or
capacities distinct from the psychic mechanisms that render
theoretical rationality possible. Depending on how it is developed,
this approach may offer a different way of accounting for the
practical consequences of practical reflection, without assuming that
reasons for action are grounded in an agent&rsquo;s subjective
motivations (Velleman 2000: Ch. 8; Wallace 1999). (For more on
practical reasons and motivation, see also the entry on
 <a href="../reasons-internal-external/">reasons for action: internal vs. external</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The connection between practical reasoning and motivation is not the
only consideration that has led philosophers to adopt internalist or
desire-based theories of reasons for action. More recently, it has
been argued that such theories are in a better position to explain our
normative reasons themselves (Schroeder 2007a). There are cases in
which features of a person&rsquo;s psychology make an obvious
difference to what the person has reason to do. Some people like to
dance, others detest this activity, and this difference in their
&ldquo;desires&rdquo; appears to determine a corresponding difference
in their reasons. Even in cases of this kind, however, it is far from
obvious that differences in the agent&rsquo;s <em>desires</em> are
what ultimately explain their differing reasons (Scanlon 2014).
Moreover, the fact that psychological factors might sometimes be
relevant to the explanation of a person&rsquo;s reasons does not
entail that they always have explanatory relevance.</p>

<h2><a name="InsStrRat">4. Instrumental and Structural Rationality</a></h2>

<p>
Among the norms of practical reason, those of instrumental rationality
have seemed least controversial to many philosophers. Instrumental
rationality, in its most basic form, instructs agents to take those
means that are necessary in relation to their given ends. In the
modern era, this form of rationality has widely been viewed as the
single unproblematic requirement of practical reason. The instrumental
principle makes no assumptions about the prospects for rational
scrutiny of peoples&rsquo; ends. Rational criticism of this kind
apparently presupposes that there are objective values or norms,
providing standards for assessment of ends that are independent from
psychological facts about what people happen to be motivated to
pursue. In line with the naturalistic attitude sketched in section
&sect;2, however, it may be doubted whether such independent standards
can be reconciled with the metaphysical commitments of contemporary
scientific practice. A world that is shorn of objective values or
norms leaves no room for rational criticism of peoples&rsquo; ends,
but only for Weberian <em>Zweckrationalit&auml;t</em>: the rational
determination of means to the realization of ends that are taken to be
given, as a matter of human psychological fact (Weber 1978).</p>

<p>
This line of thought can be traced back to the philosophy of David
Hume, who famously asserted that &lsquo;Reason is, and ought only to
be the slave of the passions&rsquo; (Hume 1739: 415). Those attracted
to the Humean approach should bear in mind, however, that the
instrumental principle is itself an objective norm. The principle says
that we are <em>rationally required</em> to take the means that are
necessary to achieve our ends; if the principle represents a binding
norm of practical reason, then we are open to rational criticism to
the extent we fail to exhibit this kind of instrumental consistency,
regardless of whether we want to comply with the principle or not. If
naturalism really entails that there can be no objective norms or
values, it may be wondered how an exception can possibly be made for
the instrumental requirement (Hampton 1998). A more consistently
naturalistic position would be to reject even
<em>Zweckrationalit&auml;t</em> in favor of a skeptical attitude
towards practical reason in all its forms&mdash;an attitude that may
well correspond to the intentions of the historical Hume (cf. Dreier
1997; Millgram 1995).</p>

<p>
Further questions can be raised about the plausibility of the
suggestion that the instrumental norm exhausts the requirements of
practical reason. The norm says that one should take the means that
are necessary relative to one&rsquo;s psychologically-given ends. But
how can the fact that a given means exhibits this kind of necessity
give a person reason to choose the means, if the end is not itself
something it would be valuable to achieve in some way? The
instrumental principle seems to function as a binding norm of
practical reason only if it is taken for granted that there are
additional, independent standards for the assessment of our ends
(Quinn 1993; Korsgaard 1997). Otherwise, it would be possible for us
to create normative reasons for action simply by adopting ends we have
no reason to adopt &ndash; a form of &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo; that
is widely regarded as implausible (Bratman 1981; Broome 2001).</p>

<p>
Restricting the instrumental principle to reasonable ends raises
another problem, however. Agents who fail to take the means to
<em>unreasonable</em> ends and those failing to take the means to
reasonable ends seem equally criticizable as instrumentally irrational
or means/end-incoherent. How could this be the case if the
instrumental principle applies only to reasonable ends? On a widely
discussed approach, the instrumental principle has to be understood as
a &ldquo;wide-scope&rdquo; normative requirement or reason, which
instructs us to be means/end-coherent, but leaves open whether to
achieve this by taking the means or by giving up the end (Broome 1999;
Wallace 2001; Bratman 2009). Thus understood, the instrumental
principle applies equally to all ends (reasonable or not), but the
detachment of reasons to take means to unreasonable ends is avoided
nevertheless. Similar proposals have been made about other kinds of
principles governing the coherence of our attitudes, including
consistency requirements on beliefs (e.g., Dancy 1977). Moreover, in
recent years has become standard to distinguish requirements of
structural rationality, such as the instrumental principle, from
substantive normative requirements or reasons (Broome 2013; Brunero
2020; Worsnip 2021). On this view, the detachment of reasons for
taking means to unreasonable ends can be avoided <em>either</em> by
claiming that structural requirements take &ldquo;wide-scope&rdquo;,
<em>or</em> by claiming that we do not generally have reasons to be
structurally rational (Kolodny 2005).</p>

<p>
Structural requirements of this kind have recently become a subject of
lively philosophical debate. The idea that there are coherence
requirements on our attitudes appears to be common ground among
philosophers who differ significantly in their views about the nature
and scope of practical reason. It is accepted by most Humeans, for
instance, who believe that there is no scope for the rational
criticism of individual ends, and also by Kantians, who think that the
requirements of reason ultimately constrain us to choose in accordance
with the moral law. From the perspective of practical and theoretical
deliberation, we commonly seem to grant the force of structural
requirements, acknowledging a kind of rational pressure to bring our
beliefs and intentions into compliance with the instrumental principle
and other standards of consistency and coherence.</p>

<p>
Many philosophers take such structural requirements at face value,
granting that practical reason is governed by and responsive to them.
Indeed, it has influentially been argued that standards of good
<em>reasoning</em>, in both the practical and the theoretical domain,
derive exclusively from structural requirements of rationality (Broome
2013). But questions arise about this approach. If structural
requirements are independent of reasons, it is an open question
whether we have any reason to comply with them, and the question has
forcefully been argued to receive a negative answer (Kolodny 2005).
But then it becomes unclear why we should care about whether our
attitudes are structurally rational and why the charge of
irrationality is commonly taken to be a serious form of criticism
(Kiesewetter 2017).</p>

<p>
More generally, there is a question about how to conceive of the
relation between structural requirements and normative reasons. One
view, held in common by some Humeans and by some Kantian
constructivists (see sec. &sect;2 above), is that reasons are
fundamentally derivative from requirements of structural rationality.
What one has reason to do, on this view, is what one would desire or
intend to do if one was fully rational (i.e. fully in compliance with
the structural requirements that govern one&rsquo;s attitudes) (cf.
Smith 1994, Markovits 2014). It is unclear, however, how such
idealized attitude accounts can avoid revisionary normative
implications without smuggling in substantive normative assumptions
into the notion of an ideally coherent agent (Worsnip 2021).</p>

<p>
For those who do not share this reductionist view, the status of
structural requirements becomes more puzzling. One might hold that
practical reason is ultimately answerable to two different kinds of
constraints: to structural requirements on the one hand, and to
independent facts about what one has reason to do on the other hand
(cf. Worsnip 2021). But this position is potentially unstable. As
pointed out already, once the independence of structural requirements
from normative reasons is made clear, it is no longer obvious why we
should care about whether our attitudes do or do not comply with the
structural requirements.</p>

<p>
On an alternative view, it is a myth that rationality requires
means/end-coherence as such (Raz 2005; Kolodny 2008), or more
generally that there are any structural requirements of rationality
(Kiesewetter 2017; Lord 2018). According to this position, coherence
should be seen as a side effect of responding correctly to reasons
rather than a rational requirement on its own, and the appearance of
structural requirements can be explained by substantive features of
the reasons to which both practical and theoretical reason are
ultimately and properly responsive. (For more on this, see also the
entries on
 <a href="../rationality-instrumental/">instrumental rationality</a>
 and on

<h2><a name="MaxRat">5. Maximizing Rationality</a></h2>

<p>
Proponents of Humean approaches to practical reason have attempted to
accommodate the rational criticism of individual ends, without
departing from the spirit of <em>Zweckrationalit&auml;t</em>, by
expanding their view to encompass the totality of an agent&rsquo;s
ends. Thus, even if there are no reasons or values that are ultimately
independent of an agent&rsquo;s given ends, the possibility remains
that we could criticize particular intrinsic desires by reference to
others in an agent&rsquo;s subjective motivational set. An
agent&rsquo;s desire for leisure, for instance, might be subordinated
insofar as its satisfaction would frustrate the realization of other
goals that are subjectively more important to the agent, such as
professional success. Practical reason, it might be suggested, is a
holistic enterprise, properly concerned not merely with identifying
means to the realization of individual ends, but with the coordinated
achievement of the totality of an agent&rsquo;s ends.</p>

<p>
Many philosophers take this holistic approach to be the most promising
way of thinking about practical reason. It defines an important and
difficult problem for practical reason to address, without departing
from the metaphysically modest assumption that there is no court of
appeal for the rational criticism of an agent&rsquo;s ends that is
independent of those ends themselves. The holistic approach finds its
most sophisticated and influential expression in the maximizing
conception of practical rationality. According to the maximizing
conception, the fundamental task of practical reason is to determine
which course of action would optimally advance the agent&rsquo;s
complete set of ends, which is typically identified with the action
whose subjective expected utility&mdash;reflecting both the utility
and probability of possible outcomes from the agent&rsquo;s point of
view (i.e. in terms of the agent&rsquo;s preferences and credences or
beliefs)&mdash;is the highest.</p>

<p>
The maximizing conception of practical rationality has been
influentially developed in decision theory and in the theory of
rational choice (as studied, for instance, in modern economics). These
disciplines articulate with mathematical precision the basic idea that
practical rationality is a matter of consistency in action: people act
rationally to the extent they do what is likely to bring about the
best state of affairs, given both their preferences and their
credences about the outcomes that may be brought about through their
agency. Proponents of these theories sometimes claim for them the
additional advantage of empirical adequacy, arguing that they are
flexible enough to accommodate the full range of behaviors that human
agents engage in, both within the marketplace and outside of it.
Especially if one operates with the notion of &lsquo;revealed
preferences&rsquo;&mdash;preferences, that is, that are ascribed to
agents solely on the basis of actual behavior&mdash;then virtually
anything an agent might choose to do could be interpreted as an
<em>attempt</em> to maximize expected utility. Decision theory, on the
resulting interpretation of it, becomes an all-encompassing framework
for understanding free human behavior, according to which all agents
who act freely are striving to produce outcomes that would be optimal,
relative to their current preferences and beliefs.</p>

<p>
If decision theory is interpreted in this way, however, then its
relevance to the understanding of practical reason may appear
correspondingly tenuous (cf. Pettit and Smith 1997). The maximization
of subjective utility is supposed to represent a normative ideal, one
by appeal to which we can assess critically the deliberations of
agents. In this guise, the attraction of the maximizing model lies in
the idea that there can be rational requirements on action, stemming
from the totality of an agent&rsquo;s preferences and credences, even
if we do not assume that there are independent, substantive standards
for the critical assessment of individual ends. But this normative
interpretation of maximizing rationality is tenable only if it is at
least conceivable that individual agents might sometimes fail to
satisfy its requirements&mdash;an &lsquo;ought&rsquo; that it is not
so much as possible to flout is not really an &lsquo;ought&rsquo; at
all (Lavin 2004). Thus the axioms of decision theory include
constraints on an agent&rsquo;s overall preferences (such as
completeness and transitivity) that might be violated even by agents
who are striving to satisfy their currently strongest desires. Such
agents will be criticizable by the lights of decision theory insofar
as there is no consistent utility function that can be ascribed to
them on the basis of their actual choices and behavior. The normative
credentials of decision theory rest, then, on the plausibility of the
axioms that are taken to define an individual utility
function&mdash;axioms that may not be quite as innocent or
uncontroversial as they initially appear (cf. Mandler 2001).</p>

<p>
Further questions arise about the plausibility of the normative
requirement to maximize expected utility. Doubts have been expressed,
for instance, in regard to the assumption that it is necessarily
irrational to fail to select that action that would be optimal,
relative to one&rsquo;s preferences and credences. Perfectly rational
agents often appear to be content with states of affairs that are
&lsquo;good enough&rsquo;, from the perspective of their aims and
desires, even when they know that alternatives are available that
promise a higher return; they &lsquo;satisfice&rsquo;, rather than
seeking to maximize the value of the outcomes achievable through their
actions (Slote 1989). They also treat their past intentions and plans
as defeasibly fixed constraints on deliberation, rather than
attempting to maximize subjective utility anew in every situation they
confront (Bratman 1987). Finally, they can adopt different attitudes
toward risk, attaching greater importance to avoiding bad outcomes
than to maximizing expected utility, as classically conceived (Buchak
2013). Defenders of the maximizing model contend that it is flexible
enough to accommodate alleged counterexamples of these kinds (Pettit
1984). If not, however, there may be grounds for doubting that it
represents a basic norm or practical reason.</p>

<p>
A different issue about maximizing rationality concerns the set of
desires or aims that is taken as fixed for purposes of applying the
requirement of maximization. We may distinguish two basic approaches.
The first and perhaps most common of these takes the subjective
utility of alternative actions to be determined by the agent&rsquo;s
preferences at the time of deliberation. According to this
interpretation of the maximization model, we are rational to the
extent we do that which best promotes the totality of our present
aims. A second and quite different interpretation results if we expand
the set of desires that determine the subjective utilities of outcomes
to include the totality of the agent&rsquo;s preferences over time.
According to this model, rational agents aim to maximize the
satisfaction of all of their anticipated desires, accepting
frustration of present preferences for the sake of greater
satisfaction at later times (Sidgwick 1907; Parfit 1984: Pt. 2; Pettit
and Smith 1997). This interpretation of the maximizing model gives
expression to the common idea that a certain prudential regard for
one&rsquo;s own future well-being is a requirement of practical reason
(Nagel 1978: Chs. 5&ndash;8). But if we take it to be a comprehensive
account of rationality in action, the prudential interpretation can
also appear to be an unstable compromise: if practical reason requires
us to factor in our future desires, should it not equally demand that
we take into account the desires of other agents who may be affected
by what we do? Why should we take the distinction between persons to
be significant for the theory of practical reason, once we have denied
such significance to the distinction between different times in the
life of a single agent (Parfit 1984; cf. section &sect;6 below)?</p>

<p>
However we define the class of desires that is subject to the
requirement of maximization, we do not need to take those desires
exactly as they are given. Many proponents of the maximizing approach
suggest that an agent&rsquo;s actual desires should be laundered
somewhat before the demand to maximize is applied. For instance, if my
desire for <em>X</em> is contingent on a false factual belief about
the nature of <em>X</em>, then it is questionable that practical
reason requires that the desire be taken into account in determining
what it is rational for me to do. A popular form of laundering would
rule out desires of this kind, by subjecting to the requirement of
maximization only those desires that would survive if the agent were
factually well-informed about the objects of desire and the
circumstances of action, and deliberating in a calm and focused frame
of mind. Indeed, once we are in the business of laundering desires we
can go still further, excluding from consideration desires that are
substantively objectionable, even if they would survive the filter of
corrected factual belief. This would at least be a way to counter
bootstrapping objections of the kind we discussed above in section
&sect;4. To move into this territory, however, would clearly be to
abandon the Humean framework of the original maximizing approach,
assuming resources for the rational criticism of ends that are
independent of the agent&rsquo;s actual dispositions.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers might respond to the cases that invite
desire-laundering by distinguishing between subjective and objective
dimensions of practical reason&mdash;between what one has reason to
do, given all the facts about one&rsquo;s situation, and what one has
reason to do given one&rsquo;s beliefs about the situation or the
evidence that is available to one. This is a distinction that can be
brought to bear on any conception of reasons and rationality, insofar
as agents operate with epistemic limitations that deprive them of
access to facts that are potentially relevant. To borrow an example
from Judith Thomson (Thomson 1990: 229), it might seem obvious that it
is rational to flip the light switch as you enter your office if it is
dark outside and you are planning to do some reading. But suppose that
flipping the switch will, through a series of remarkable coincidences
that nobody could have anticipated, cause a dangerous lighting flash
in the house next door. We might want to say that objectively, you had
compelling reason not to operate the switch, even if you were
perfectly rational to do so given the evidence available to you (cf.
Parfit 2011: Chs. 5 and 7).</p>

<p>
Applying this distinction to the maximizing approach, one might
maintain that our corrected desires are relevant to determining what
we objectively ought or have reason to do. But we are often not in a
position to know the facts that determine what we have objective
reason to do. When this is the case, we can hardly be faulted for a
failure of rationality. Indeed, the potential inaccessibility of
objective reasons raises larger questions about the standing of the
objectivist conception of practical reason, according to which the
central &lsquo;ought&rsquo; of practical deliberation corresponds to
what we have most objective reason to do. Perspectivists about
practical reason argue that the &lsquo;ought&rsquo; of deliberation
must be understood in terms of an epistemically constrained notion of
a reason (Kiesewetter 2011, 2017: Ch. 8). Some degree of desire
laundering is defensible, according to this line of thought, but it
should be understood to involve correction of desires in the light of
facts about the world that are accessible to the agent.</p>

<h2><a name="ConValMorRea">6. Value, Prudence, and Morality</a></h2>

<p>
If maximizing rationality is not the unproblematic requirement of
practical reason that it initially seemed to be, what are the
alternatives to it? Let us begin with the assumption that critical
assessment of an agent&rsquo;s individual ends is off-limits. This
idea has been questioned by many philosophers, who point out that our
basic aims in life are often rather inchoate; people want, for
instance, to be successful in their careers, and loyal to their
friends, without being clear about what exactly these ends require of
them. To the extent one&rsquo;s ends are indeterminate in this way,
they will not provide effective starting points for instrumental,
maximizing, or even satisficing reflection. We need to specify such
ends more precisely before we can begin to think about which means
they require us to pursue, or to generate from them a rank-ordering of
possible outcomes. Here is a possible task for practical reason that
does not fit neatly into the categories of instrumental or maximizing
reflection, however broadly construed (Kolnai 1962; Wiggins 1975;
Richardson 1994).</p>

<p>
Reflection about the nature of our given ends is not an easy or
well-defined activity. There are no straightforward criteria for
success in this kind of enterprise, and it is often unclear when it
has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. These considerations
encourage the Humean assumption&mdash;especially widespread in the
social sciences&mdash;that there is no reasoning about final ends. On
the other hand, how is one supposed to clarify one&rsquo;s largest and
most important ends, if not by reasoning about them in some way?
Rather than exclude such reflection because it does not conform to a
narrowly scientific paradigm of reason, perhaps we should expand our
conception of practical reason to make room for interpretative
reflection about the ends of action. To do so would be to acknowledge
that practical reason has an essentially heuristic dimension, one that
is connected to the project of self-understanding (Williams 1979). By
working out the meaning and implications of such antecedent
commitments as loyalty or success, for instance, we also help to get
clear the values that define who we really are (Taylor 1985).</p>

<p>
Instrumental models of practical reason are sometimes thought to rest
on a basically consequentialist account of the relation of action to
value (Anderson 1993). According to this account, value inheres
ultimately in states of affairs, insofar as it is these that are the
objects of subjective preference rankings. Actions are then judged
rational to the extent they bring about states of affairs that are
valuable in this way. It is a matter of controversy, however, whether
this is the most plausible way of thinking about the rationality of
action. Defenders of satisficing models, for example, think that a
given action can be rational even when it is acknowledged by the agent
that a different action would bring about a more valuable state of
affairs. Alternatively, it might be maintained that we can judge an
action rational without being able to arrive at any clear independent
ranking of the state of affairs produced by it, as better or worse
than the alternatives. Perhaps our judgments of the value of actions
are ultimately parasitic on our convictions about what there is reason
to do or to admire; in that case, we will not be able to derive
conclusions about reasons from antecedent premises in the theory of
value (Scanlon 1998: Ch. 2). Related questions have been raised about
the basic consequentialist assumption that value attaches in the first
instance to states of affairs. Thus it may seem to distort our
understanding of friendship, for instance, to maintain that what
friends value fundamentally are states of affairs (involving, say,
joint activities with the friend); what people value as friends are
rather concrete particulars or relations, such as the persons with
whom they are befriended or their relationships with those persons.
Building on this idea in the theory of value, it has been proposed
that actions are rational insofar as they succeed in expressing the
attitudes that it is rational to adopt toward the true bearers of
intrinsic value: people, animals, and things (Anderson 1993).</p>

<p>
A supposed advantage of this expressive approach is its ability to
explain the rationality of behaviors that seem intuitively sensible,
but that are hard to fit into the consequentialist scheme (such as
commitments deriving from one&rsquo;s past involvement in an activity
or project, which can look like an irrational weighting of &lsquo;sunk
costs&rsquo; to the consequentialist; cf. Nozick 1993). But some
defenders of the consequentialist model contend that it can account
for such phenomena. For instance, if friends have special,
&lsquo;agent-relative&rsquo; reasons to attend to the interests of
each other&mdash;and not merely reasons to promote the neutral value
of friendship wherever it may be instantiated&mdash;this can be
expressed in consequentialist terms by introducing person-indexed
value functions, which rank possible states of affairs in terms of
their desirability from the agent&rsquo;s point of view (Portmore
2011; Sen 2000; for criticism, see Schroeder 2007b; Wallace 2010; for
more on this, see also the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory">value theory</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Whether or not we accept a consequentialist framework, questions in
the theory of value would seem to be an important focus for practical
reflection. Many philosophers are attracted to the idea that reasons
for action are ultimately provided by the values that can be realized
through action (Raz 1999). If this is right, and if we assume as well
a realist or at least non-subjectivist conception of value, then a
different way of conceptualizing the task of practical reason comes
into view. This may be thought of not as a matter of maximizing the
satisfaction of the agent&rsquo;s given ends, nor of specifying ends
that are still inchoate, but rather as the task of understanding and
responding appropriately to the values that bear on action. This task
in turn admits of a number of different interpretations. In the spirit
of G. E. Moore (1903), we might interpret the evaluative reflection
relevant to deliberation in consequentialist terms, as reflection
about a property of goodness that is instantiated by states of the
world (cf. Maguire 2016). An influential alternative to it, inspired
by Aristotle, holds that the proper focus of practical reflection is
not the production of good outcomes, but the goal of acting well as a
person. According to this approach, the values that are relevant to
determining what an agent ought to do are those that are specifically
connected to human virtue; one acts well, on this view, to the extent
one does what a good or virtuous person would do (Lawrence 1995; Foot
2001; Thompson 2008; Thomson 2008). A somewhat different view
dispenses with the reference to the ideal of the virtuous person,
appealing directly to the plurality of specific values that may be
realized intrinsically through action. The result is an expansive
conception of practical reason, according to which any concrete
dimension of value that might be instantiated through our agency falls
within the purview of practical deliberation (Raz 1999, 2011).</p>

<p>
While such a value-based conception of practical reasons has become an
increasingly influential alternative to the Humean, desire-based
conception, the thesis that all practical reasons can be explained in
terms of the value of actions has not gone unchallenged. Cases of
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-incommensurable/">incommensurable values</a>
 or other kinds of value indeterminacy have been brought forward in
favor of a hybrid view, which incorporates desire- or will-based
reasons alongside value-based reasons (Chang 2013). On another kind of
view, there are certain moral reasons &ndash; such as, for example,
the reason involved in the obligation to keep one&rsquo;s promise
&ndash; that have to be explained in terms of the voluntary exercise
of a normative power to create a reason rather than in terms of the
value of the action (Owens 2012; Kiesewetter 2022a).</p>

<p>
Morality has provided an especially fertile source of examples and
problems for the theory of practical reason. A defining question of
moral philosophy is the question of the rational authority of moral
norms: to what extent, and under what conditions, do people have
compelling reasons to comply with the demands of morality?
(Alternatively: to what extent, and under what conditions, are people
rationally required to comply with those demands?) Reflection on this
question has produced some of the most significant and illuminating
philosophical work in the theory of practical reason. One tendency
within this body of work is skeptical about the rational authority of
moral norms, precisely because they are at odds with the standards to
which practical reason is ultimately answerable. A certain kind of
Humean, for instance, might question the idea that morality is a
source of inescapable or categorical reasons or requirements, arguing
that all normative considerations are contingent on the subjective
motivations of individual agents, some of whom might just not care
about whether their conduct is morally objectionable (Williams 1985,
1989).</p>

<p>
Another kind of skepticism is based on the natural idea that practical
reason is primarily answerable to norms of prudence, i.e. norms that
require agents to be responsive to evaluative facts about what is good
for them or what promotes their own well-being (see Fletcher 2021 for
discussion of such norms). Thus, on a widely shared picture, moral
demands are strictly impartial and often call for significant personal
sacrifices, leading to a fundamental conflict between morality and
prudential reason (Singer 1972).</p>

<p>
Some take this conflict to call into question the rational credentials
of moral requirements, precisely because compliance with them is at
odds with the agent&rsquo;s own good (Dorsey 2016). Alternatively, we
might follow Sidgwick in postulating a &ldquo;dualism of practical
reason&rdquo;; this affirms the rational credentials of both prudence
and impartial morality, and concedes, pessimistically, that they often
pull in different directions (Sidgwick 1907: Bk. 4, Ch. 6; cf. Parfit
2011: Ch. 6). A still different response to this apparent tension is
to maintain that it rests on a misinterpretation of the requirements
of prudence. Thus it has been argued that, though morality imposes
constraints on the direct pursuit of individual utility, these
constraints can be justified in the terms of prudential rationality;
the strategy of morally-constrained maximization is recommended on
grounds of enlightened self-interest, and this in turn accounts for
the authority of moral considerations to govern the practical
reflection of individuals (Gauthier 1986).</p>

<p>
Discussions of the rational credentials of morality are bound up with
substantive accounts of the content of moral requirements. Consider
utilitarianism and other consequentialist approaches to the normative
structure of morality, which interpret moral rightness in terms of the
value of the consequences (of actions, policies, institutions, or
other objects of moral assessment). On the one hand, many versions of
consequentialism exacerbate the apparent conflict between morality and
prudence&mdash;as Sidgwick saw, the individualized demand to maximize
the impartial good seems fundamentally at odds with the prudential
imperative to promote one&rsquo;s own well-being. At the same time, as
Sidgwick also discerned, consequentialist interpretations of morality
derive at least some of their appeal from the fact that they apply to
the moral domain the maximizing model of rationality that seems both
familiar and appealing outside of moral contexts (cf. Scheffler 1988).
Thus one way to argue for ethical consequentialism is to observe that
it is the theory that results when we combine the requirement of
maximization with a distinctively moral constraint of impartiality,
applying the requirement to a set of preferences that includes those
of all the persons (or other sentient creatures) potentially affected
by our actions (Harsanyi 1982).</p>

<p>
Those who wish to vindicate the rational credentials of morality in
the face of skeptical challenges have often taken issue with
consequentialist conceptions of the moral (or at least their
traditional interpretations). Such views ascribe to us very demanding
requirements of impartial benevolence, which leave little scope for
the independent significance of the agent&rsquo;s own projects and
interests (Williams 1973). But a more reasonable interpretation of
morality might be one that accommodates the independence of the
personal point of view (Scheffler 1982), by allowing that moral
requirements are sensitive to both moral and prudential considerations
(Stroud 1998; Portmore 2011: Ch. 5; Schmidt 2023).</p>

<p>
Non-consequentialists typically think of morality as a source of
deontological requirements&mdash;such as prohibitions on murder and
deception&mdash;that place constraints on the pursuit of the good,
including both the good of the agent and the impartial good. If we
wish to vindicate the rational credentials of morality, on this
interpretation of it, then we will need to expand our conception of
practical reason to include rational requirements very different from
the ones that are salient in other domains.</p>

<p>
There are two connected features of moral norms that seem particularly
significant in this connection. First, they are intuitively understood
to include agent-relative reasons for action (Nagel 1978). Thus, if I
have promised that I will take you to the airport tomorrow afternoon,
this consideration has a significance for me that it does not
necessarily have for other agents. In particular, the importance to me
of keeping my promise seems to be independent from the impersonal end
of promissory fidelity. This shows itself in the fact that my reason
to keep the promise I have made would be unaffected if I found myself
in a scenario in which breaking my promise would lead five other
agents to keep promises they would otherwise have flouted. Second,
these agent-relative considerations have a distinctive function within
practical deliberation. They are not merely considerations that speak
in favor of the actions they recommend, but operate rather as
practical requirements that presumptively constrain the agent&rsquo;s
activities. The fact that I have promised to take you to the airport
tomorrow, for instance, is ordinarily a decisive basis for concluding
that that is to be done. I do not need to weigh this consideration
against other values that might be pursued under the circumstances;
rather, the promissory commitment enters the deliberative field from
the start in the deontic guise of an obligation or a
&ldquo;pre-emptive&rdquo; or &ldquo;exclusionary reason&rdquo; (Raz
1986, 1990; Wallace 2019).</p>

<p>
There are divergent approaches that have been taken within ethical
theory for making sense of these salient features of moral reasons.
Kantians for instance, take rational agents to impose the moral law on
themselves when they act, where the law in question functions as a
limiting condition on the pursuit of their ends (O&rsquo;Neill 1989;
Korsgaard 1996). Proponents of virtue theory take it that compliance
with some agent-centered requirements is partly constitutive of being
a good human being (Foot 2001). A still different class of approaches
understands moral norms in essentially interpersonal terms: either as
demands that are (at least hypothetically) imposed by agents on each
other (Darwall 2009), or as relational requirements that define what
we owe <em>to</em> each other, and that make possible relations of
mutual recognition or regard (Scanlon 1998; Wallace 2019). These are
very disparate ways of conceptualizing morality as a sui genesis
domain of agent-centered obligations. They have in common, however, a
commitment to the idea that reflection on the nature of morality can
bring to light structures of practical reason that would not otherwise
be salient.</p>
