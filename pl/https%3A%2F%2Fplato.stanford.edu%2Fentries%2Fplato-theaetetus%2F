<h1>Plato on Knowledge in the <em>Theaetetus</em></h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat May 7, 2005; substantive revision Fri Feb 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
This article introduces Plato&rsquo;s dialogue the <em>Theaetetus</em>
(section 1), and briefly summarises its plot (section 2). Two leading
interpretations of the dialogue, the Unitarian and Revisionist
readings, are contrasted in section 3. Sections 4 to 8 explain and
discuss the main arguments of the chief divisions of the dialogue.
Section 9 provides some afterthoughts about the dialogue as a whole.
One of the most challenging issues in this dialogue, as in all
Platonic dialogues, is the comparison with Plato&rsquo;s other
writings, and especially the understanding of its chronological and
theoretical placement within the <em>corpus</em> of Plato&rsquo;s
works. Alongside the numerous significant themes present in the
dialogue, there are bibliographical references to the extensive
secondary literature on the <em>Theaetetus</em>. These references will
point to the most important and recent studies.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The <em>Theaetetus</em>, which probably dates from about 369 BC, is
arguably Plato&rsquo;s greatest work on epistemology. (Arguably, it is
his greatest work on anything.) Plato (c. 427&ndash;347 BC) has much
to say about the nature of knowledge elsewhere. But only the
<em>Theaetetus</em> offers a set-piece discussion of the question
&ldquo;What is knowledge?&rdquo; (on the place and meaning of the
<em>Theaetetus</em> within Plato&rsquo;s oeuvre see Migliori 2022).
Moreover, one must not overlook the great influence this dialogue had
already in antiquity, for example, in Hellenistic philosophies,
particularly in Epicureanism and Stoicism. Some studies have shown how
the <em>Theaetetus</em> was one of the most important Platonic
dialogues with which the Epicureans, the Stoics and the Academics
closely and consistently engaged in the development of their theories
of knowledge (see, for example, Long 2006, Ioppolo 2013, Verde 2020
and 2024b).</p>

<p>
Like many other Platonic dialogues, the <em>Theaetetus</em> is
dominated by question-and-answer exchanges, with Socrates as main
questioner. His two respondents are Theaetetus, a brilliant young
mathematician (see Narcy 1995, 63&ndash;69 on Theaetetus&rsquo; role
in the development of Greek mathematics), and Theaetetus&rsquo; tutor
Theodorus, who is rather less young (and rather less brilliant). It is
highly significant that Plato chooses two mathematicians as
interlocutors: the dialogue is aporetic, meaning that not even the
brilliant mathematician Theaetetus, who engages with one of the
&ldquo;exact sciences,&rdquo; is able to define what knowledge truly
is. It is hard not to discern, behind this point, a subtle Platonic
critique of the mathematics of his time.</p>

<p>
Also like other Platonic dialogues, the main discussion of the
<em>Theaetetus</em> is set within a framing conversation
(142a&ndash;143c) between Eucleides and Terpsion (cp. <em>Phaedo</em>
59c). This frame may be meant as a dedication of the work to the
memory of the man Theaetetus. Sedley 2004 (6&ndash;8) has argued that
it is meant to set some distance between Plato&rsquo;s authorial voice
and the various other voices (including Socrates&rsquo;) that are
heard in the dialogue. Alternatively, or also, it may be intended,
like <em>Symposium</em> 172&ndash;173, to prompt questions about the
reliability of knowledge based on testimony. (Cp. the law-court
passage (<em>Theaetetus</em> 201a&ndash;c), and Socrates&rsquo; dream
(201c&ndash;202c).)</p>

<p>
It is well known that the literary framework is an extremely important
element for understanding Platonic dialogues (see Capuccino 2014). The
framework of the <em>Theaetetus</em> is particularly significant
because it features Socrates&rsquo; disciple, Eucleides of Megara,
recounting to Terpsion the dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus
(which took place shortly before Socrates&rsquo; death), the content
of which Socrates himself had related to Eucleides. Eucleides
(142d&ndash;143a) notes that he wrote down some notes
(<em>hypomn&#275;mata</em>) to capture the reasoning of that dialogue;
he further adds that whenever he traveled to Athens, he would ask
Socrates if there was anything he did not remember, which allowed him
to correct what he had written. This is an exceptionally important and
unique element within the entire Platonic <em>corpus</em>: according
to Platonic literary fiction, the <em>Theaetetus</em> is a dialogue
written by Eucleides under the supervision of Socrates, who would
correct what Eucleides had written each time (see Kaklamanou-Pavlou
2016). This indicates the central role of Socrates in this text and
the crucial importance of this dialogue within Plato&rsquo;s
philosophical project.</p>

<p>
The <em>Theaetetus</em>&rsquo; most important similarity to other
Platonic dialogues is that it is <em>aporetic</em>&mdash;it is a
dialogue that ends in an <em>impasse</em>. The <em>Theaetetus</em>
reviews three definitions of knowledge in turn; plus, in a preliminary
discussion, one would-be definition which, it is said, does not really
count. Each of these proposals is rejected, and no alternative is
explicitly offered. Thus we complete the dialogue without discovering
what knowledge is. From the outset, it must be clarified that the
object of analysis in the dialogue is not a generic notion of
knowledge but the <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>&mdash;that is,
scientific knowledge (which could also be translated as
&ldquo;science&rdquo;) that is <em>absolutely</em> stable, grounded,
and incontrovertible. We discover only three things that knowledge is
<em>not</em> (210c; cp. 183a5, 187a1). This is a crucial point that
highlights the positive and heuristic role of aporia in Plato (see,
for instance, Erler 1987): at the end of the dialogue (210a-b),
Socrates clearly rules out the possibility that the definition of
knowledge could coincide with perception (<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>),
correct opinion (<em>orth&ecirc; doxa</em>), or even correct opinion
with justification/account (<em>logos</em>). From a Platonic
perspective, this is not a meager result but rather an essential
foundation for continuing the inquiry and for definitively excluding
what cannot be considered knowledge.</p>

<p>
It is normally supposed that Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em> and
<em>Theaetetus</em> are dialogues strictly connected each other,
probably in that order. If so, and if we take as seriously as Plato
seems to the important criticisms of the theory of Forms that are made
in the <em>Parmenides</em>, then the significance of the
<em>Theaetetus</em>&rsquo;s return to the aporetic method looks
obvious. Apparently Plato has abandoned the certainties of his
middle-period works, such as the theory of Forms, and returned to the
almost-sceptical manner of the early dialogues. (It should be noted
that here the term &lsquo;sceptical&rsquo; is used in its more common
sense and has nothing to do with Ancient Scepticism whether in its
Academic or Pyrrhonian variants.) In the <em>Theaetetus</em>, the
Forms that so dominated the <em>Republic</em>&rsquo;s discussions of
epistemology are hardly mentioned at all. The fact that there is very
likely no clear and explicit reference to the theory of Forms in the
dialogue is a striking fact, especially in a text fully dedicated to
knowledge, given that the Forms are undoubtedly Plato&rsquo;s
definitive response to the problem of what knowledge is. The key
question, then, is to understand why, in the <em>Theaetetus</em>,
Plato does not directly address the Forms to resolve this central
issue in his philosophy. A good understanding of the dialogue must
make sense of this fact.</p>

<h2 id="SumDia">2. Summary of the Dialogue</h2>

<p>
Like other Platonic dialogues, the <em>Theaetetus</em> also possesses
an ethical-moral significance, which is clearly marked by the
so-called Digression on the philosophical life. This significance is
evident from the very beginning of the text: the dialogue (142a) opens
with Eucleides of Megara recounting how he saw Theaetetus at the port,
returning from the Battle of Corinth (either the one in 394 BC or,
more likely, the one in 369 BC), in critical condition (see Mele
2002). Thus, Plato presents Theaetetus not only as an excellent
mathematician but also as a patriot who offers his life for his
<em>polis</em>; this suggests that science and philosophy must always
carry moral and civic value. At the gates of the city of Megara in 369
BC, Eucleides and Terpsion hear a slave read out Eucleides&rsquo;
memoir of a philosophical discussion that took place in 399 BC,
shortly before Socrates&rsquo; trial and execution (142a&ndash;143c);
according to a passage from the <em>Anonymous Commentator on the</em>
Theaetetus (<em>PBerol.</em> 9782, coll. III 28-IV 6
Bastianini-Sedley; the most recent critical edition of the papyrus
&ndash; with Italian translation and commentary &ndash; is by
Bastianini-Sedley 1995; on this text see Tarrant 2000, Ch. 11 and
Bonazzi 2003, Ch. 5), there was a double prologue of the
<em>Theaetetus</em> circulating in antiquity. This has led some
scholars to believe in the existence of two different versions of the
dialogue (see Tulli 2011). In this, the young Theaetetus is introduced
to Socrates by his mathematics tutor, Theodorus. Socrates questions
Theaetetus about the nature of expertise, and this leads him to pose
the key question of the dialogue: &ldquo;What is knowledge?&rdquo;
(143d&ndash;145e). Theaetetus&rsquo; first response (<em>D0</em>) is
to give examples of knowledge such as geometry, astronomy, harmony,
arithmetic (146a&ndash;c). Socrates objects that, for any <em>x</em>,
examples of <em>x</em> are neither necessary nor sufficient for a
definition of <em>x</em> (146d&ndash;147e; this argument inevitably
recalls the passage about the swarm of virtues in the <em>Meno</em>
71e). Theaetetus admits this, and contrasts the ease with which he and
his classmates define mathematical terms with his inability to define
knowledge (147c&ndash;148e). Socrates offers to explain
Theaetetus&rsquo; bewilderment about the question &ldquo;What is
knowledge?&rdquo; by comparing himself with a midwife: Theaetetus, he
suggests, is in discomfort because he is in intellectual labour
(148e&ndash;151d). In this regard, it is important to note that the
<em>Theaetetus</em> is a significant dialogue as it contains one of
the most detailed descriptions of the Socratic maieutic method (see
Ioppolo 1999, xiv-xvi and Giannopoulou 2022). From the outset (144c),
Theaetetus is presented by Plato as a true alter ego of
Socrates&mdash;that is, as the quintessential (Socratic) philosopher
who, despite his hesitance to engage directly with Socrates, is filled
with a desire for knowledge and seeks to pursue it through dialogue
(see Verde 2024a on the &lsquo;Socratic&rsquo; nature of the young
Theaetetus). Socrates (150a-b) compares himself to midwives but
asserts that his role is superior to theirs. His greatest skill, he
explains, is the ability to distinguish and ascertain whether the soul
of his interlocutor is &ldquo;giving birth&rdquo; to something false
or true. It should be noted that Socrates does not do this because he
himself possesses the truth; rather, he is only able to discern
whether his interlocutor&rsquo;s response is valid for the
continuation of the inquiry. Socrates, therefore, aided also by divine
intervention (150d), assists those he recognizes as truly
&ldquo;pregnant&rdquo; with knowledge&mdash;that is, those who,
metaphorically, are in labor (151a-b). Here, the metaphor of labor
signifies <em>aporia</em>, literally the lack of a way out, which for
Socrates holds heuristic value: to be in <em>aporia</em> means to be
in the ideal state to continue the search for knowledge.</p>

<p>
Thus prompted, Theaetetus states his first acceptable definition,
which is the proposal that</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>D1</em>)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Knowledge is perception (<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>)&rdquo;
(151d&ndash;e).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Socrates does not respond to this directly. Instead he claims that
<em>D1</em> entails two other theories (Protagoras&rsquo; and
Heracleitus&rsquo;), which he expounds (151e&ndash;160e) and then
criticises (160e&ndash;183c). Socrates eventually presents no fewer
than eleven arguments, not all of which seem seriously intended,
against the Protagorean and Heracleitean views. If any of these
arguments hit its target, then by <em>modus tollens</em> <em>D1</em>
is also false. A more direct argument against <em>D1</em> is
eventually given at 184&ndash;187.</p>

<p>
In 187b4&ndash;8, Theaetetus proposes a second definition of
knowledge:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>D2</em>)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Knowledge is true belief (<em>orth&ecirc;
doxa</em>).&rdquo;</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>D2</em> provokes Socrates to ask: how can there be any such thing
as <em>false</em> belief? There follows a five-phase discussion which
attempts to come up with an account of false belief. All five of these
attempts fail, and that appears to be the end of the topic of false
belief. Finally, at 200d&ndash;201c, Socrates returns to <em>D2</em>
itself. He dismisses <em>D2</em> just by arguing that accidental true
beliefs cannot be called <em>knowledge</em>, giving Athenian jurymen
as an example of accidental true belief.</p>

<p>
Theaetetus tries a third time. His final proposal is:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>D3</em>)</dt>
<dd>Knowledge is &ldquo;true belief with an account
(<em>logos</em>)&rdquo; (201c&ndash;d).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The ensuing discussion attempts to spell out what it might be like for
<em>D3</em> to be true, then makes three attempts to spell out what a
<em>logos</em> is.</p>

<p>
In 201d&ndash;202d, the famous passage known as <em>The Dream of
Socrates</em>, a two-part ontology of elements and complexes is
proposed. Parallel to this ontology runs a theory of explanation that
claims that to explain, to offer a <em>logos</em>, is to analyse
complexes into their elements, i.e., those parts which cannot be
further analysed. Crucially, the Dream Theory says that knowledge of
<em>O</em> is true belief about <em>O</em> plus an account of
<em>O</em>&rsquo;s composition. If <em>O</em> is not composite,
<em>O</em> cannot be known, but only &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; (202b6).
When Socrates argues against the Dream Theory (202d8&ndash;206b11), it
is this entailment that he focuses on.</p>

<p>
Socrates then turns to consider, and reject, three attempts to spell
out what a <em>logos</em> is&mdash;to give an account of
&ldquo;account.&rdquo; The first attempt takes <em>logos</em> just to
mean &ldquo;speech&rdquo; or &ldquo;statement&rdquo; (206c&ndash;e).
The second account (206e4&ndash;208b12) of &ldquo;<em>logos</em> of
<em>O</em>&rdquo; takes it as &ldquo;enumeration of the elements of
<em>O</em>.&rdquo; The third and last proposal (208c1&ndash;210a9) is
that to give the <em>logos</em> of <em>O</em> is to cite the
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em> or <em>diaphora</em> of <em>O</em>, the
&ldquo;sign&rdquo; or diagnostic feature wherein <em>O</em> differs
from everything else.</p>

<p>
All three attempts to give an account of &ldquo;account&rdquo; fail.
The day&rsquo;s discussion, and the dialogue, end in <em>aporia.</em>
Socrates leaves to face his enemies in the courtroom.</p>

<h2 id="OveIntThe">3. Overall Interpretations of the <em>Theaetetus</em></h2>

<p>
The <em>Theaetetus</em> is a principal field of battle for one of the
main disputes between Plato&rsquo;s interpreters. This is the dispute
between <em>Unitarians</em> and <em>Revisionists</em>.</p>

<p>
Unitarians argue that Plato&rsquo;s works display a unity of doctrine
and a continuity of purpose throughout. Unitarians include Aristotle,
Proclus, and all the ancient and mediaeval commentators; Bishop
Berkeley; and in the modern era, Schleiermacher, Ast, Shorey,
Di&egrave;s, Ross, Cornford, and Cherniss.</p>

<p>
Revisionists retort that Plato&rsquo;s works are full of revisions,
retractations, and changes of direction. Eminent Revisionists include
Lutoslawski, Ryle, Robinson, Runciman, Owen, McDowell, Bostock, and
many recent commentators.</p>

<p>
Unitarianism is historically the dominant interpretive tradition.
Revisionism, it appears, was not invented until the text-critical
methods, such as stylometry, that were developed in early
Nineteenth-Century German Biblical studies were transferred to
Plato.</p>

<p>
In the Twentieth Century, a different brand of Revisionism has
dominated English-speaking Platonic studies. This owes its impetus to
a desire to read Plato as charitably as possible, and a belief that a
charitable reading of Plato&rsquo;s works will minimise their
dependence on the theory of Forms. (Corollary: Unitarians are likelier
than Revisionists to be sympathetic to the theory of Forms.)</p>

<p>
Unitarianism <em>could</em> be the thesis that all of Plato&rsquo;s
work is, really, Socratic in method and inspiration, and that Plato
should be credited with no view that is not endorsed in the early
dialogues. (In some recent writers, Unitarianism <em>is</em> this
thesis: see Penner and Rowe [2005].) But this is not the most usual
form of Unitarianism, which is more likely to &ldquo;read back&rdquo;
the concerns of the <em>Phaedo</em> and the <em>Republic</em> into the
Socratic dialogues, than to &ldquo;read forward&rdquo; the studied
agnosticism of the early works into these more ambitious later
dialogues. Likewise, Revisionism <em>could</em> be evidenced by the
obvious changes of outlook that occur, e.g., between the
<em>Charmides</em> and the <em>Phaedo</em>, or again between the
<em>Protagoras</em> and the <em>Gorgias</em>. But the main focus of
the Revisionist/Unitarian debate has never been on these dialogues.
The contrasts between the <em>Charmides</em> and the <em>Phaedo</em>,
and the <em>Protagoras</em> and the <em>Gorgias</em>, tell us little
about the question whether Plato ever abandoned the theory of Forms.
And that has usually been the key dispute between Revisionists and
Unitarians.</p>

<p>
Hence the debate has typically focused on the contrast between
&ldquo;the Middle Period dialogues&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Late
dialogues.&rdquo; Revisionists say that the Middle Period dialogues
enounce positive doctrines, above all the theory of Forms, which the
Late dialogues criticise, reject, or simply bypass. The main place
where Revisionists (e.g., Ryle 1939) suppose that Plato criticises the
theory of Forms is in the <em>Parmenides</em> (though some
Revisionists find criticism of the theory of Forms in the
<em>Theaetetus</em> and <em>Sophist</em> as well). The main places
where Revisionists look to see Plato managing without the theory of
Forms are the <em>Theaetetus</em> and <em>Sophist</em>.</p>

<p>
Ryle&rsquo;s Revisionism was soon supported by other Oxford Plato
scholars such as Robinson 1950 and Runciman 1962 (28). Revisionism was
also defended by G.E.L. Owen. More recently, McDowell 1976, Bostock
1988, and Burnyeat 1990 are three classic books on the
<em>Theaetetus</em> of a decidedly Revisionist tendency. (McDowell
shows a particularly marked reluctance to bring in the theory of Forms
anywhere where he is not absolutely compelled to.)</p>

<p>
Revisionists are committed by their overall stance to a number of more
particular views<em>.</em> They are more or less bound to say that the
late Plato takes the <em>Parmenides&rsquo;</em> critique of the theory
of Forms to be cogent, or at least impressive; that the
<em>Sophist&rsquo;</em>s theory of &ldquo;the five greatest
kinds&rdquo; (<em>Sophist</em> 254b&ndash;258e) is not a development
of the theory of Forms; and that the <em>Timaeus</em> was written
before the <em>Parmenides</em>, because of the <em>Timaeus&rsquo;</em>
apparent defence of theses from the theory of Forms. Their line on the
<em>Theaetetus</em> will be that its argument does not support the
theory of Forms; that the <em>Theaetetus</em> is interesting precisely
because it shows us how good at epistemology Plato is once he
<em>frees</em> himself from his obsession with the Forms.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the Revisionist claim that the <em>Theaetetus</em>
shows Plato doing more or less completely without the theory of Forms
is very plausible. There are no explicit mentions of the Forms at all
in the <em>Theaetetus</em>, except possibly (and even this much is
disputed) in what many take to be the philosophical backwater of the
Digression and in the introduction of common concepts/properties
(<em>koina</em>). The main argument of the dialogue seems to get along
without even implicit appeal to the theory of Forms. In the
<em>Theaetetus</em>, Revisionism seems to be on its strongest ground
of all. It must be emphasized, however, that if Forms were explicitly
present in the dialogue, its outcome would likely not be aporetic.
Everything suggests that Plato is well aware&mdash;based on
comparisons with other dialogues&mdash;that absolute knowledge
coincides with the knowledge of Forms. However, such knowledge, as
especially indicated in the <em>Phaedo</em>, is only possible for the
disembodied soul (see Trabattoni 2012 and the reply by Ferrari
2013).</p>

<p>
The usual Unitarian answer is that this silence is studied. In the
<em>Theaetetus</em>, Unitarians suggest, Plato is showing what
knowledge <em>is not</em>. His argument is designed to show that
certain sorts of alternatives to Plato&rsquo;s own account of
knowledge must fail. Plato demonstrates this failure by the
&lsquo;maieutic&rsquo; method of developing those accounts
<em>until</em> they fail. Thus the <em>Theaetetus</em> shows the
impossibility of a successful account of knowledge that does not
invoke the Forms. From this perspective, the <em>Theaetetus</em>
demonstrates, on the one hand, what knowledge certainly is not
(perception, true opinion, etc.), and, on the other, the impossibility
of arriving at a definitive and absolutely valid definition of
knowledge within the confines of present life.</p>

<p>
The fault-line between Unitarians and Revisionists is the deepest
fissure separating interpreters of the <em>Theaetetus</em>. It is not
the only distinction among overall interpretations of the dialogue. It
has also been suggested, both in the ancient and the modern eras, that
the <em>Theaetetus</em> is a sceptical work; that the
<em>Theaetetus</em> is a genuinely aporetic work; and that the
<em>Theaetetus</em> is a disjointed work. However, there is no space
to review these possibilities here. A few words on the sceptical
interpretation of the <em>Theaetetus</em>. As mentioned at the outset,
the <em>Theaetetus</em> has been one of the most extensively
&ldquo;pillaged&rdquo; dialogues by Hellenistic philosophies. However,
Platonic dialogues were often not read and interpreted in their
entirety; rather, various philosophical schools emphasized the
importance of select parts, sometimes even out of context. It is
highly likely that the so-called Academic sceptics, beginning with
Arcesilaus, saw in the <em>Theaetetus</em>&mdash;and especially in its
aporetic outcome&mdash;a crucial dialogue for their view that
absolute, dogmatic knowledge, assumed as possible by the Stoics and
Epicureans, was a chimera. Nevertheless, when this dialogue is
considered within the larger Platonic <em>corpus</em>, it is difficult
to conclude that Plato would have been or became a sceptic precisely
with the <em>Theaetetus</em>. To regard Plato as a sceptic, in the
sense that this label would later assume&mdash;particularly with
Neo-Pyrrhonism from Aenesidemus onward&mdash;is a considerable
overstatement. Plato, as noted earlier, fully recognizes that the
knowledge of Forms is absolute knowledge; however, within the limits
of earthly life, it is essentially impossible to provide a definitive
definition of knowledge or to attain solid
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>. In brief, Plato seems to suggest that it
is not possible to provide an absolutely valid definition of
knowledge, yet this does not mean that knowledge does not exist or
(for the disembodied soul) cannot be attained. Indeed, the Socratic
inquiry into knowledge presupposes its existence. From this
perspective, the <em>Theaetetus</em> is and remains a quintessentially
Socratic dialogue&mdash;not because Plato pushes Socratic thought to
its limits to declare its failure in the realm of knowledge, but
because it is the Socratic dialogue itself that concludes that an
absolutely valid definition is unattainable. To this, Plato, so to
speak, adds the theory of Forms, which, going well beyond Socratic
philosophy, constitutes the genuine Platonic response to the problem
of knowledge (the fact that this genuinely Platonic theory is not
explicitly present in the <em>Theaetetus</em> does not necessarily
indicate that Plato abandoned it or that, for Plato, knowledge is
impossible). It is time to look more closely at the detail of the
arguments that Plato gives in the distinct sections of the
dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="IntDia142">4. The Introduction to the Dialogue: 142a&ndash;145e</h2>

<p>
We should not miss the three philosophical theses that are explicitly
advanced in the Introduction. They are offered without argument by
Socrates, and agreed to without argument by Theaetetus, at
145d7&ndash;145e5:</p>

<ol>

<li>The wise are wise <em>sophiai</em> (= by/ because of/ in respect
of/ as a result of wisdom: 145d11).</li>

<li>To learn is to become wiser about the topic you are learning about
(145d8&ndash;9).</li>

<li>Wisdom (<em>sophia</em>) and knowledge
(<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>) are the same thing (145e5).</li>
</ol>

<p>
All three theses might seem contentious today. (1) seems to allude to
<em>Phaedo</em> 100e&rsquo;s notorious thesis about the role of the
Form of <em>F</em>-ness in any <em>x</em>&rsquo;s being
<em>F</em>&mdash;that <em>x</em> is <em>F</em> &ldquo;<em>by</em> the
Form of <em>F</em>-ness.&rdquo; (2) looks contentious because it
implies (3); and (3) brings us to a second question about
142a&ndash;145e (which is also an important question about the whole
dialogue): What is the meaning of the Greek word that we are
translating as &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>?
It can be stated that the identification of <em>sophia</em> and
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> (which appears multiple times in the
dialogue) is the key to understanding the type of knowledge Socrates
seeks (see Benitez-Guimaraes 1993 and Moss 2021, 234&ndash;242).
Socrates is not concerned with a generic or superficial concept of
knowledge; rather, he seeks <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> that coincides
with <em>sophia</em>, understood as a form of knowledge that is
absolute and incontrovertible.</p>

<h2 id="DefExa146">5. Definition by Examples: 146a&ndash;151d</h2>

<p>
At 145d Socrates states the &ldquo;one little question that
puzzles&rdquo; him: &ldquo;What is knowledge?&rdquo; Theaetetus&rsquo;
first response (<em>D0</em>) is to offer examples of knowledge (146c).
Socrates rejects this response, arguing that, for any <em>x</em>,
examples of <em>x</em> are neither necessary nor sufficient for a
definition of <em>x</em>. They are not necessary, because they are
irrelevant (146e). They are not sufficient, because they presuppose
the understanding that a definition is meant to provide
(147a&ndash;b). Moreover (147c), a definition could be briefly stated,
whereas talking about examples is &ldquo;an interminable
diversion&rdquo; (<em>aperanton hodon</em>).</p>

<p>
Theaetetus is puzzled by his own inability to answer Socrates&rsquo;
request for a definition of knowledge, and contrasts it with the ease
with which he can provide mathematical definitions. He gives an
example of a mathematical definition; scholars are divided about the
aptness of the parallel between this, and what would be needed for a
definition of knowledge. Socrates&rsquo; response, when Theaetetus
still protests his inability to define knowledge, is to compare
himself to a midwife in a long and intricate analogy.</p>

<p>
Many ancient Platonists read the midwife analogy, and more recently
Cornford 1935 has read it, as alluding to the theory of recollection
(see Trabattoni 2022). But it is better not to import metaphysical
assumptions into the text without good reason, and it is hard to see
what the reason would be beyond a determination to insist that Plato
always maintained the theory of recollection. With or without this
speculation, the midwife passage does tell us something important
about how the <em>Theaetetus</em> is going to proceed. As previously
mentioned, the fact that the <em>Theaetetus</em> contains one of the
most comprehensive descriptions of Socrates&rsquo; maieutic method (in
addition to the fact that, in the literary fiction crafted by Plato,
the <em>Theaetetus</em> has been &ldquo;checked&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; by Socrates himself) appears to be a clear
authorial signal of the importance that Socratic teaching holds for
Plato in the domain of knowledge. In line with the classification that
the ancient editors set at the front of the dialogue, it is going to
be <em>peirastikos</em>, an <em>experimental</em> dialogue (see Diog.
Laert. III.49&ndash;51; see too Alb. <em>Prolog.</em> III.148, 23 ff.,
p. 31 N&uuml;sser). It has rightly been clarified that ancient
commentators attempted to classify the Platonic dialogues primarily to
&ldquo;neutralize&rdquo; their aporetic nature, which could indeed
hinder any effort to systematize Plato&rsquo;s <em>corpus</em> and
philosophy (Ferrari 2011,141). Given that the <em>Theaetetus</em>
possesses a philosophical scope that might even be considered superior
to the <em>Sophist</em> or the <em>Parmenides</em> (see again Ferrari
2011, 141&ndash;142), reducing a dialogue &ldquo;supervised&rdquo; by
Socrates himself to a mere zetetic exercise seems excessive and is a
reading that Plato himself would likely not have endorsed. The
aporetic nature of the dialogue should not only not be neutralized but
stands as an undeniable fact; it is, in fact, a method Plato uses to
assert what knowledge certainly is not and to demonstrate the
impossibility of attaining absolute knowledge during earthly life,
even for &ldquo;pure scientists&rdquo; such as mathematicians like
Theodorus and Theaetetus (see Tschemplik 2008, Ch. 5). Anyway, this
dialogue will try out a number of suggestions about the nature of
knowledge. As in the aporetic dialogues, there is no guarantee that
any of these suggestions will be successful (and every chance that
none of them will be).</p>

<p>
So read, the midwife passage can also tell us something important
about the limitations of the <em>Theaetetus&rsquo;</em> inquiry. The
limitations of the inquiry are the limitations of the main inquirers,
and neither (the historical) Socrates nor Theaetetus was a
card-carrying adherent of Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms. Perhaps the
dialogue brings us only as far as the threshold of the theory of Forms
precisely because, on Socratic principles, one can get no further. To
get beyond where the <em>Theaetetus</em> leaves off, you have to be a
Platonist. This is an extremely delicate point because it represents
the central issue on which interpretations of the dialogue diverge. If
we consider the <em>Theaetetus</em> as a fully philosophical text,
Plato intends to communicate doctrines of significant relevance within
his philosophy. According to one interpretation, the
<em>Theaetetus</em> can be seen as the text marking the crisis of
Socratism and Plato&rsquo;s radical departure from Socratic
philosophy: within the limits of Socratism, it is impossible to reach
any universally valid definition&mdash;i.e., to arrive at
truth&mdash;achieving only a temporary and always debatable concord
(<em>homologia</em>). However, the <em>Theaetetus</em> can also be
interpreted differently: not as a sign of Socratism&rsquo;s definitive
crisis but rather as Plato&rsquo;s distinctly Socratic acknowledgment
that human inquiry cannot exceed certain well-defined limits (which,
incidentally, coincide with the limits of <em>logoi</em>, the
discourse that underpins any investigation) without this leading to
scepticism.</p>

<p>
According to this interpretation, the <em>Theaetetus</em> contains no
explicit reference to the theory of Forms (for if it did, it would not
be an aporetic dialogue), yet this does not exclude the existence of
absolute knowledge. Instead, under this view, absolute knowledge is
the prerogative of disembodied, rather than embodied, souls. This does
not mean that knowledge is unattainable in this life, but it is not
possible to achieve knowledge that is absolute and incontrovertible.
(For book-length developments of this reading of the
<em>Theaetetus</em>, see Sedley 2004 and Chappell 2005.)</p>

<h2 id="FirDefD1KnoPer151">6. First Definition (<em>D1</em>): &ldquo;Knowledge is Perception&rdquo;: 151e&ndash;187a</h2>

<p>
Between Stephanus pages 151 and 187, and leaving aside the Digression,
172&ndash;177 (section 6.4), 31 pages of close and complex argument
state, discuss, and eventually refute the first of Theaetetus&rsquo;
three serious attempts at a definition of knowledge:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>D1</em>)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Knowledge is perception.&rdquo;</dd>
</dl>

<p>
As before, there are two main alternative readings of 151&ndash;187:
the Unitarian and the Revisionist. On the Unitarian reading,
Plato&rsquo;s purpose is to salvage as much as possible of the
theories of Protagoras and Heracleitus (each respectfully described as
<em>ou phaulon</em>: 151e8, 152d2). Plato&rsquo;s strategy is to show
that these theories have their own distinctive area of application,
the perceptible or sensible world, within which they are true.
However, the sensible world is not the whole world, and so these
theories are not the whole truth. We get absurdities if we try to take
them as unrestrictedly true. To avoid these absurdities it is
necessary to posit the <em>intelligible world</em> (the world of the
Forms but, of course, as has been indicated several times, Plato is by
no means explicit in the dialogue about introducing the intelligible
realm) alongside the <em>sensible world</em> (the world of
perception). When this is done, Platonism subsumes the theories of
Protagoras and Heracleitus as partial truths. On this reading, the
strategy of the discussion of <em>D1</em> is to transcend Protagoras
and Heracleitus: to explain their views by showing how they are, not
the truth, but parts of a larger truth. In the process the discussion
reveals logical pressures that may push us towards the two-worlds
Platonism that many readers, e.g., Ross and Cornford, find in the
<em>Republic</em> and <em>Timaeus.</em></p>

<p>
On the Revisionist reading, Plato&rsquo;s purpose is to refute the
theories of Protagoras and Heracleitus. He thinks that the absurdities
those theories give rise to, come not from trying to take the theories
as <em>unrestrictedly</em> true, but from trying to take them as true
<em>at all</em>, even of the sensible world. Anyone who tries to take
seriously the thesis that knowledge is perception has to adopt
theories of knowledge and perception like Protagoras&rsquo; and
Heracleitus&rsquo; (on Heracleitus, it is also important to consider
Aristotle&rsquo;s testimony in the <em>De Anima</em>, I.2, 405a
25&ndash;28 = 22 A 15 Diels-Kranz = III 9 R43 Laks-Most, where it is
stated that for Heracleitus the soul is incorporeal and in constant
flux. Therefore, what is in motion&mdash;namely, the reality of
things&mdash;can be known only by what is also in motion, that is, the
soul). But their theories are untenable. By <em>modus tollens</em>
this shows that <em>D1</em> itself is untenable. On this reading, the
strategy of the discussion of <em>D1</em> is to move us towards the
view that sensible phenomena have to fall under the same general
metaphysical theory as intelligible phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="DefKnoPer151">6.1 The Definition of Knowledge as Perception: 151d&ndash;e</h3>

<p>
At 151d7&ndash;e3 Theaetetus proposes:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>D1</em>)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Knowledge is <em>nothing other than</em> perception&rdquo;
(<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Socrates immediately equates <em>D1</em> with Protagoras&rsquo;s
thesis that</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>Hm</em>)</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Man is the measure of all things&rdquo; (<em>homo
mensura</em>; to correctly understand Protagoras&rsquo; doctrine,
attention must be paid to the term <em>h&ocirc;s</em>: &ldquo;of all
things&mdash;<em>chremata</em>, which could also be translated as
&lsquo;facts&rsquo; or &lsquo;substances&rsquo;&mdash;man is the
measure, of those that are <em>as</em> (<em>h&ocirc;s</em>) they are,
and of those that are not <em>as</em> (<em>h&ocirc;s</em>) they are
not.&rdquo; In this context, <em>h&ocirc;s</em> (= as) precisely
indicates the manner in which things appear or are phenomenally
presented to the subject; see on Protagoras&rsquo; doctrine Corradi
2012: 112&ndash;132).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and takes this, in turn, to entail the thesis:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(<em>PS</em>)</dt>
<dd>Things are to any human just as they appear to that human
(<em>phenomenal subjectivism</em>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Socrates then adds that, in its turn, <em>PS</em> entails
Heracleitus&rsquo; view that &ldquo;All is flux,&rdquo; that there are
no stably existing <em>objects</em> with stably enduring
<em>qualities</em>. Of course, Heracleitus is mentioned in the text,
but it should not be overlooked that Socrates is primarily referring
to Protagoras, to whom a secret or private doctrine is attributed (see
Lisi 2020). According to some scholars (for example, Brancacci 2011;
see too Zilioli 2022), this doctrine is not an invention of Plato but
rather a historically authentic teaching of the sophist. In addition
to Protagoras and Heracleitus (152e) as proponents of the doctrine of
flux, Socrates also mentions Empedocles, as well as Epicharmus (one
likely reference could be the so-called fragments <em>ex Alcimo</em>
of Epicharmus transmitted by Diogenes Laertius III 9 ff.), and Homer.
Of particular interest is the fact that Socrates explicitly excludes
Parmenides from the group of philosophers who support the doctrine of
flux; indeed, Plato interprets Parmenides&rsquo; philosophy as a form
of immobility, whereby genuine knowledge is possible only if things
remain unchanging (there are no compelling reasons to exclude the
possibility that Plato himself genuinely believed that perception
cannot constitute knowledge because sensible objects are in constant
flux). In this respect, the exclusion of Parmenides suggests that, at
least in the realm of knowledge, Plato aligns himself much more
closely with Parmenides than with the other philosophers mentioned
(see Trabattoni 2018, 178 n. 60).</p>

<p>
The first of these deft exchanges struck the <em>Anonymous
Commentator</em> as disingenuous: &ldquo;Plato himself knew that
Protagoras&rsquo; opinion about knowledge was not the same as
Theaetetus&rsquo;&rdquo; (Anon., col. LXII 8&ndash;12
Bastianini-Sedley). Certainly it is easy to see counter-examples to
the alleged entailment. Take, for instance, the thesis that knowledge
is <em>awareness</em> (which is often the right way to translate
<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>; on this concept see Aronadio 2016). Or take
the thesis that to know is to perceive things as God, or the Ideal
Observer, perceives them, and that we fail to know (or to perceive)
just insofar as our opinions are other than God&rsquo;s or the Ideal
Observer&rsquo;s. These theses are both versions of <em>D1</em>.
Neither version entails the claim that &ldquo;man is the measure of
all things&rdquo; (<em>Hm</em>)&mdash;nor the Protagorean view that
lies behind that slogan.</p>

<p>
So how, if at all, does <em>D1</em> entail all the things that
Socrates apparently makes it entail in 151&ndash;184? And does Plato
think it has all these entailments? Evidently the answer to that
depends on how we understand <em>D1</em>. In particular, it depends on
the meaning of the word <em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>,
&ldquo;perception,&rdquo; in <em>D1</em>. If the slogan
&ldquo;Knowledge is perception&rdquo; equates knowledge with what
ordinary speakers of classical Greek would have meant by
<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>, then <em>D1</em> does not entail
Protagoras&rsquo; and Heracleitus&rsquo; views. In the ordinary sense
of <em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>, there are (as just pointed out) too many
other possible ways of spelling out <em>D1</em> for the move from
<em>D1</em> to <em>Hm</em> to be logically obligatory. But if the
slogan &ldquo;Knowledge is perception&rdquo; equates knowledge with
what Protagoras and Heracleitus meant by <em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>,
<em>D1</em> <em>does</em> entail Protagoras&rsquo; and
Heracleitus&rsquo; views. Of course it does; for then <em>D1</em>
simply says that knowledge is just what Protagoras and Heracleitus say
knowledge is.</p>

<h3 id="ColWinArgTheFlu152">6.2 The &ldquo;Cold Wind&rdquo; Argument, and the Theory of Flux: 152a&ndash;160e</h3>

<p>
At 152b1&ndash;152c8 Socrates begins his presentation of
Protagoras&rsquo; view that things are to any human just as they
appear to that human by taking the example of a wind which affects two
people differently. Such cases, he says, support Protagoras&rsquo;
analysis: &ldquo;that the wind is cold <em>to the one who feels
cold</em>, but not cold <em>to the one who does not feel
cold.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In 155c&ndash;157c the flux theory is used to develop a
Protagorean/Heracleitean account of perception, to replace accounts
based on the object/property ontology of common sense. At 156a,
Socrates mentions the doctrine of unnamed
<em>kompsoteroi</em>&mdash;literally, &ldquo;more refined&rdquo;
philosophers&mdash;who proposed a variation on the theory of flux. The
identity of these <em>kompsoteroi</em> has been widely debated. If
they are not a Platonic &ldquo;invention&rdquo; (cf. Sedley 2004, 46
n. 9) and if we exclude a reference to the Cyrenaics (according to
Zilioli 2012, 47&ndash;71, they would be Aristippus and the early
Cyrenaics; Giannantoni 1958, 129&ndash;145, and Tsouna 1998,
124&ndash;137, hold a different view), one might also consider them as
disciples of Protagoras. The core of the <em>kompsoteroi</em> doctrine
lies in the idea that everything (<em>to pan</em>) is
<em>kinesis</em>: it is an especially radical doctrine, as it
categorically excludes the existence of anything outside of motion.
Socrates states that they acknowledge two types of <em>kinesis</em>:
one capable of acting (<em>poiein</em>) and another of
suffering/undergoing (<em>paschein</em>). Closely connected to this
distinction is that between <em>aisth&ecirc;ton</em> and
<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em> (156b)&mdash;the sensible (what is the object
of perception) and perception itself. This differentiation is decisive
for Socrates in clarifying how the perceptual process is, in every
case, the result of a relationship between <em>poiein</em> and
<em>paschein</em>, between <em>aisth&ecirc;ton</em> and
<em>aisth&ecirc;sis</em>.</p>

<p>
Socrates notes the subversive implications of the theory of flux for
the meaningfulness and truth-aptness of most of our language as it
stands. (He returns to this point at 183a&ndash;b.) The ontology of
the flux theory distinguishes kinds of &ldquo;process&rdquo;
(<em>kin&ecirc;sis</em>), i.e., of flux, in two ways: as fast or slow,
and as active or passive. Hence there are four such processes. On
these the flux theory&rsquo;s account of perception rests.</p>

<p>
At 157c&ndash;160c Socrates states a first objection to the flux
theory. This asks how the flux theorist is to distinguish false
(deceptive) appearances such as dreams from the true (undeceptive)
appearances of the waking world. The flux theorist&rsquo;s answer is
that such appearances should not be described as &lsquo;true&rsquo;
and &lsquo;false&rsquo; appearances to the same person. Rather they
should be described as different appearances to different people.
According to the flux theorist, we have the same person if and only if
we have the same combination of a perception and a perceiving
(159c&ndash;d). So there is no need to call any appearances
<em>false</em>. Thus we preserve the claim that all appearances are
true&mdash;a claim which must be true if knowledge is perception in
the sense that Socrates has taken that definition.</p>

<p>
160b&ndash;d summarises the whole of 151&ndash;160. Socrates shows how
the exploration of Theaetetus&rsquo; identification of knowledge with
perception has led us to develop a whole battery of views: in
particular, a Protagorean doctrine of the incorrigibility of
perception, and a Heracleitean account of what perception is. Thus
&ldquo;perception has one of the two marks of knowledge,
infallibility&rdquo; (Cornford 1935, 58); &ldquo;and, if we can accept
Protagoras&rsquo; identification of what appears to me with what is,
ignoring the addition &lsquo;for me&rsquo; and the distinction between
being and becoming, the case will be complete.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="RefTheKnoPer160">6.3 The Refutation of the Thesis that Knowledge is Perception: 160e5&ndash;186e12</h3>

<p>
160e marks the transition from the statement and exposition of the
definition of knowledge as perception (<em>D1</em>), to the
presentation of criticism and refutation of that definition.</p>

<p>
Scholars have divided about the overall purpose of 160e&ndash;186e.
Mostly they have divided along the lines described in section 3,
taking either a Revisionist or a Unitarian view of Part One of the
<em>Theaetetus</em>.</p>

<p>
If some form of Unitarianism is correct, an examination of
160&ndash;186 should show that Plato&rsquo;s strategy in the critique
of <em>D1</em> highlights two distinctions:</p>

<ol>

<li>A distinction between the claim that <em>the</em> <em>objects of
perception</em> are in flux, and the claim that <em>everything</em> is
in flux.</li>

<li>A distinction between bare sensory awareness, and judgement on the
basis of such awareness.</li>
</ol>

<p>
One vital passage for distinction (1) is 181b&ndash;183b. If
Unitarianism is right, this passage should be an attack on the
Heracleitean thesis that <em>everything</em> is in flux, but not an
attack on the Heracleitean thesis that <em>the objects of
perception</em> are in flux. According to Unitarians, the thesis that
the objects of perception are in flux is a Platonic thesis too.
Readers should ask themselves whether this is the right way to read
181b &ndash;183b. Anyway, this is an important and likely plausible
point; after all, if Plato had not seriously considered the flux of
all things, his refutation of Protagoras&rsquo; position would be
difficult to sustain. Ultimately, the refutation of Protagoras&rsquo;
doctrine of flux is not merely intended to exclude the reduction of
knowledge to mere perception; it also aims to demonstrate that
authentic knowledge presupposes a well-defined stability, which flux,
by its nature, cannot provide. This, however, does not mean that no
form of knowledge of the sensible world is possible; it only means
that this knowledge will not be <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>, that is,
absolute and incontrovertible knowledge.</p>

<p>
Distinction (2) seems to be explicitly stated at 179c. There also
seems to be clear evidence of distinction (2) in the final argument
against <em>D1</em>, at 184&ndash;187. Distinction (2) is also at
work, apparently, in the discussion of some of the nine objections
addressed to the Protagorean theory. Some of these objections can
plausibly be read as points about the unattractive consequences of
failing to distinguish the Protagorean claim that bare sense-awareness
is incorrigible (as the Unitarian Plato agrees) from the further
Protagorean claim that <em>judgements about</em> sense-awareness are
incorrigible (which the Unitarian Plato denies).</p>

<p>
The criticism of <em>D1</em> breaks down into twelve separate
arguments, interrupted by the Digression (172c&ndash;177c: translated
and discussed separately in section 6.4 below). There is no space here
to comment in detail on every one of these arguments, some of which,
as noted above, have often been thought frivolous or comically
intended (cp. 152e1&ndash;153d5). Some brief notes on the earlier
objections will show what the serious point of each might be.</p>

<p>
The first objection to Protagoras (160e&ndash;161d) observes that if
all perceptions are true, then there is no reason to think that animal
perceptions are inferior to human ones: a situation which Socrates
finds absurd.</p>

<p>
This distinction between arguments against a Protagorean view about
perception and a Protagorean view about judgement about perception is
relevant to the second objection too (161d&ndash;162a). This objection
(cp. <em>Cratylus</em> 386c) makes the point that Protagoras&rsquo;
theory implies that no one is wiser than anyone else. Notably, the
argument does not attack the idea that <em>perception</em> is
infallible. Rather, it attacks the idea that the opinion or judgement
that anyone forms <em>on the basis of</em> perception is infallible
(161d3). (This is an important piece of support for Unitarianism: cp.
distinction (2) above.)</p>

<p>
A third objection to Protagoras&rsquo; thesis is very quickly stated
in Socrates&rsquo; two rhetorical questions at 162c2&ndash;6. Since
Protagoras&rsquo; thesis implies that all perceptions are true, it not
only has the allegedly absurd consequence that animals&rsquo;
perceptions are not inferior to humans. It also has the consequence
that humans&rsquo; perceptions are not inferior to the gods&rsquo;.
This consequence too is now said to be absurd.</p>

<p>
As with the first two objections, so here. If we consider divinities
and humans just as perceivers, there is no automatic reason to prefer
divine perceptions, and hence no absurdity. Plato may well want us to
infer that the Greek gods are not different just in respect of being
<em>perceivers</em> from humans. But they <em>are</em> different in
their powers of judgement about perceptions.</p>

<p>
The next four arguments (163a&ndash;168c) present counter-examples to
the alleged equivalence of knowledge and perception. The fourth
observes that, if perception = knowledge, then anyone who perceives an
utterance in a given language should have knowledge of that utterance,
i.e., understand it&mdash;which plainly doesn&rsquo;t happen. The
fifth raises a similar problem about memory and perception:
remembering things is <em>knowing</em> them, but not
<em>perceiving</em> them. The sixth (the &ldquo;covered eye&rdquo;)
objection contrasts <em>not perceiving</em> an object (in one sensory
modality) with <em>not knowing it</em>. If perception = knowledge,
seeing an object with one eye and not seeing it with the other would
appear to be a case of the contradictory state of both knowing it and
not knowing it. The seventh points out that one can perceive dimly or
faintly, clearly or unclearly, but that these adverbial distinctions
do not apply to ways of knowing&mdash;as they must if knowing
<em>is</em> perceiving.</p>

<p>
In 165e4&ndash;168c5, Socrates sketches Protagoras&rsquo;s response to
these seven objections (this section is usually called the <em>Apology
of Protagoras</em>). Protagoras makes two main points. First, he can
meet some of the objections by distinguishing types and occasions of
perception. Second, teaching as he understands it is not a matter of
getting the pupil to have true rather than false beliefs. Since there
are no false beliefs, the change that a teacher can effect is not a
change from false belief to true belief or knowledge. Rather,
Protagoras&rsquo; model of teaching is a <em>therapeutic</em> model.
What a good teacher does, according to him, is use arguments (or
discourses: <em>logoi</em>) as a good doctor uses drugs, to replace
the state of the soul in which &ldquo;bad things are and appear&rdquo;
with one in which &ldquo;good things are and appear.&rdquo; While all
beliefs are <em>true</em>, not all beliefs are <em>beneficial</em>.
Protagoras&rsquo;s discourse is a <em>makros logos</em>, a lengthy and
elaborate speech typical of the Sophists. Although the issue is highly
controversial, it is reasonable to believe that what Plato has
Protagoras express in this section of the dialogue is not entirely
incompatible with the sophist&rsquo;s own thought. Nevertheless, it
must be remembered that it is still Plato who writes the so-called
<em>Apology of Protagoras</em>: the philosopher has every interest in
distinguishing himself from the sophist, especially in differentiating
the realm of truth from that of utility. Protagoras explains how the
doctrine of <em>homo mensura</em> should be interpreted: it should not
be considered in epistemological terms. The point is that Protagoras
is less concerned with truth or falsity than with goodness and
utility. The sophist (166d&ndash;e) does not deny the existence of
wisdom and the figure of the wise person; rather, like the good
rhetorician, the wise person is one who can transform
(<em>metaball&ocirc;n</em>) what appears and is bad into what appears
and is good. This principle also holds in the political realm, which
is of particular interest to the Sophists: rhetoricians are capable of
making the good, rather than the bad, appear just to cities (167c).
Plato&rsquo;s stance could not be more opposed: he is interested in
truth, which has nothing to do with the realm of appearances. What is
politically just, in short, must not merely appear just but must be
just in reality.</p>

<p>
A difficulty for Protagoras&rsquo; position here is that, if all
beliefs are true, then all beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial
must be true. But surely, some beliefs about which beliefs are
beneficial contradict other beliefs about which beliefs are
beneficial; especially if some people are better than others at
bringing about beneficial beliefs. (For example, no doubt
Plato&rsquo;s and Protagoras&rsquo; beliefs conflict at this point.)
This means that Protagoras&rsquo; view entails a contradiction of the
same sort as the next objection&ndash;the famous
<em>peritrop&ecirc;</em>, on which see Castagnoli 2010 and Trabattoni
2020&mdash;seems to be meant to bring out.</p>

<p>
The <em>peritrop&ecirc;</em> (&ldquo;table-turning&rdquo;) objection
(171a&ndash;b) is this. Suppose I believe, as Protagoras does, that
&ldquo;All beliefs are true,&rdquo; but also admit that &ldquo;There
is a belief that &lsquo;Not all beliefs are true&rsquo;.&rdquo; If all
beliefs are true, the belief that &ldquo;Not all beliefs are
true&rdquo; must be true too. But if that belief is true, then by
disquotation, not all beliefs are true. So I refute myself by
contradicting myself; and the same holds for Protagoras.</p>

<p>
The validity of the objection has been much disputed. Burnyeat, Denyer
and Sedley all offer reconstructions of the objection that make it
come out valid. McDowell and Bostock suggest that although the
objection does not prove what it is meant to prove
(self-contradiction), it does prove a different point (about
self-defeat) which is equally worth making.</p>

<p>
Socrates&rsquo; ninth objection presents Protagoras&rsquo; theory with
a dilemma. If the theory is completely general in its application,
then it must say that not only what counts as <em>justice</em> in
cities, but also what <em>benefits</em> cities, is a relative matter.
As Protagoras has already admitted (167a3), it is implausible to say
that benefit is a relative notion. But the alternative, which
Protagoras apparently prefers, is a conceptual divorce between the
notions of justice and benefit, which restrict the application of
Protagoras&rsquo; theory to the notion of justice. Socrates obviously
finds this conceptual divorce unattractive, though he does not,
directly, say why. Instead, he offers us the Digression.</p>

<h3 id="Dig172">6.4 The Digression: 172c1&ndash;177b7</h3>

<p>
An obvious question: What is the Digression for? One answer (defended
in Chappell 2005, <em>ad loc.</em>) would be that it is a critique of
the society that produces the conceptual divorce between justice and
benefit that has just emerged. Socrates draws an extended parallel
between two types of character, the philosophical man and the man of
rhetoric, to show that it is better to be the philosophical type.</p>

<p>
The Digression (on which see above all B&eacute;natou&iuml;l 2020 and
Spinelli 2002) is &ldquo;philosophically quite pointless,&rdquo;
according to Ryle 1966, 158. Less dismissively, McDowell 1976, 174
suggests that the Digression serves &ldquo;a purpose which, in a
modern book, might be served by footnotes or an appendix.&rdquo;
Similarly, Cornford 1935, 83 suggests that Plato aims to give the
reader some references for anti-relativist arguments that he presents
elsewhere: &ldquo;To argue explicitly against it would perhaps take
him too far from the original topic of perception. Instead, he inserts
[the Digression], which contains allusions to such arguments in other
works of his.&rdquo; If the Digression were merely an appendix or a
footnote, it would be difficult to understand Plato&rsquo;s interest
in the themes addressed in this text. As has been noted (Polansky
1992, 134), the Digression contains Socrates&rsquo; defense of
philosophy (for this reason, it is a crucial text). It is highly
significant that Plato chose to include this defense of philosophy
specifically within a dialogue dedicated to
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>. This clearly shows that, for Plato, any
theoretical discussion is always intertwined with ethics and, above
all, with practical and political action. One possible meaning of the
Digression is precisely the defense of philosophy and the figure of
the philosopher, who is only seemingly useless to the city in which he
resides. In this text, one can clearly sense the echo of
Socrates&rsquo; trial and death; indeed, the Digression can be
regarded, after the <em>Apology of Socrates</em> and the
<em>Crito</em>, as one of Plato&rsquo;s most significant responses to
the image of Socrates&mdash;and more broadly, of the
philosopher&mdash;portrayed by Aristophanes, especially in the
<em>Clouds</em> (see Giannopoulou 2013, 1&ndash;12).</p>

<p>
The Digression (173c) also includes an almost hyperbolic description
of the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; philosopher, who lives in the city only
bodily, while his soul is dedicated to understanding the depths of the
earth, measuring its surface, and ascending to the heavens to
contemplate the stars&mdash;much like Thales, who, having fallen into
a well while gazing at the stars, was ridiculed by the Thracian
maidservant. This portrayal of the philosopher in his essence, though
exaggerated, is not entirely a caricature. It serves Plato&rsquo;s
purpose of illustrating that, precisely because the philosopher seems
the most awkward and ill-suited, he is in fact the most beneficial to
political life. This is because only the philosopher&mdash;not the
rhetorician&mdash;strives to know reality in itself. This deeply
Socratic aspiration for knowledge makes the Digression a perfectly
coherent section within the broader themes of the
<em>Theaetetus</em>.</p>

<p>
The Digression is an essential text in the history of Platonism
because it presents the famous doctrine of assimilation to god
(<em>homoi&ocirc;sis theo<sub>i</sub></em>), which gained immense
influence not only within Platonism (see Giardina 2022) but also in
the philosophies of the Hellenistic period (see Erler 2002 and
Reydams-Schils 2017). However, it is crucial to note that the doctrine
of assimilation to god is preceded by a statement that Polansky (1992,
141) rightly deemed the most important and central in the entire
dialogue. Socrates dramatically observes that evil cannot perish
because there must always be something opposed to good; furthermore,
evil does not reside among the gods but roams the earth. For this
reason, the philosopher must strive, as far as possible (<em>kata to
dynaton</em>&mdash;a critical phrase), not to identify with god (which
is impossible) but to assimilate to god. From a certain perspective,
this suggests a form of escape; yet Plato immediately clarifies that
assimilating to god involves attaining justice and holiness through
wisdom (<em>phron&ecirc;sis</em>). This notion emphasizes that only
god is absolutely just, holy, and wise, and thus, contrary to
Protagoras&rsquo; position, it is not humanity but god who is the
measure of all things. To assimilate to god means to become as just as
possible, but this ideal can only be realized on earth. In this way,
Plato justifies the philosopher&rsquo;s responsibility for moral and
political action in concrete terms.</p>

<p>
Plato (176c) further states that knowledge (<em>gn&ocirc;sis</em>) of
this truth (i.e., that god is absolutely just and that the man who
assimilates his nature to the divine becomes as just as possible)
constitutes true (<em>alethin&ecirc;</em>) wisdom (<em>sophia</em>)
and virtue (<em>aret&ecirc;</em>), whereas ignorance (<em>agnoia</em>)
represents unawareness (<em>amathia</em>) and wickedness
(<em>kakia</em>). This reveals the pivotal significance of the
Digression: it not only defends the dignity of the philosophical life
against that of rhetoricians, who are accustomed to operating within
the constraints of courtrooms and delivering speeches restricted by
definite time limits (unlike philosophical discourse, which is not
bound by time), but also legitimizes the moral and political
engagement of the philosopher in the world. Ultimately, it concludes
that true knowledge lies in the assimilation to god. From this
perspective, the <em>Theaetetus</em>, as a dialogue on
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> which, according to Plato, has to be
identified with <em>sophia</em>, is not aporetic.</p>

<p>
Another common question about the Digression is: does it introduce or
mention the Platonic Forms? Certainly the Digression uses phrases that
are indisputably part of the Middle-Period language for the Forms. If
Plato uses the language of the theory of Forms in a passage which is
admitted on all sides to allude to the themes of the
<em>Republic</em>, it strains credulity to imagine that Plato is not
intentionally referring to the Forms in that passage.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, as the Revisionist will point out, the
<em>Theaetetus</em> does not seem to <em>do</em> much with the Forms
that are thus allegedly introduced. But perhaps it would undermine the
Unitarian reading of the <em>Theaetetus</em> if the Forms
<em>were</em> present in the Digression in the role of paradigm
objects of knowledge. For the Unitarian reading, at least on the
version that seems to us as most plausible, says that the aim of the
<em>Theaetetus</em> is to show that, in the end, we cannot construct a
theory of knowledge without the Forms&mdash;a claim which is to be
proved by trying and failing, three times, to do so. So if the Forms
were there in the Digression, perhaps that would be a case of
&ldquo;giving the game away.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="LasObjPro177">6.5 Last Objection to Protagoras: 177c6&ndash;179b5</h3>

<p>
After the Digression Socrates returns to criticising Protagoras&rsquo;
relativism. His last objection is that there is no coherent way of
applying Protagoras&rsquo; relativism to judgements about the
future.</p>

<p>
How might Protagoras counter this objection? Protagoras has already
suggested that the past may now be no more than whatever I now
remember it to have been (166b). Perhaps he can also suggest that the
future is now no more than I now believe it will be. No prediction is
ever proved wrong, just as no memory is ever inaccurate. All that
happens is it seems to one self at one time that something <em>will
be</em> true (or <em>has been</em> true), and seems to another self at
another time that something different <em>is</em> true.</p>

<h3 id="LasObjHer179">6.6 Last Objection to Heracleitus: 179c1&ndash;183c2</h3>

<p>
Socrates argues that if Heracleitus&rsquo; doctrine of flux is true,
then no assertion whatever can properly be made. Therefore (a)
Heracleitus&rsquo; theory of flux no more helps to prove that
knowledge <em>is</em> perception than that knowledge <em>is</em>
<em>not</em> perception, and (b) Heracleiteans cannot coherently say
anything at all, not even to state their own doctrine.</p>

<p>
There are two variants of the argument. On the first of these
variants, evident in 181c2&ndash;e10, Socrates distinguishes just
<em>two</em> kinds of flux or process, namely qualitative alteration
and spatial motion, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed
to saying that both are continual. On the second variant, evident
perhaps at 182a1, 182e4&ndash;5, Socrates distinguishes indefinitely
many kinds of flux or process, not just qualitative alteration and
motion through space, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed
to saying that <em>every</em> kind of flux is continual.</p>

<p>
Now the view that everything is always changing in every way might
seem a rather foolish view to take about everyday objects. But, as
182a2&ndash;b8 shows, the present argument is not about everyday
objects anyway. Plato does not apply his distinction between kinds of
change to every sort of object whatever, including everyday objects.
He applies it specifically to the objects (if that is the word) of
Heracleitean metaphysics. These items are supposed by the Heracleitean
to be the reality underlying all talk of everyday objects. It is at
the level of these Heracleitean perceivings and perceivers that
Plato&rsquo;s argument against Heracleitus is pitched. And it is not
obviously silly to suppose that Heracleitean perceivings and
perceivers are constantly changing in every way.</p>

<p>
The argument that Socrates presents on the Heracleiteans&rsquo; behalf
infers from &ldquo;Everything is always changing in every way&rdquo;
that &ldquo;No description of anything is excluded.&rdquo; How does
this follow? McDowell 1976, 181&ndash;182 finds the missing link in
the impossibility of <em>identifications</em>. We cannot (says
McDowell) identify a moving sample of whiteness, or of seeing, <em>any
longer</em> once it has changed into some other colour, or
perception.</p>

<p>
But this only excludes <em>re</em>identifications: presumably I can
identify the moving whiteness or the moving seeing <em>until</em> it
changes, even if this only gives me an instant in which to identify
it. This point renders McDowell&rsquo;s version, as it stands, an
invalid argument. If it is on his account possible to identify the
moving whiteness <em>until it changes</em>, then it is on his account
possible to identify the moving whiteness. But if that is possible,
then his argument contradicts itself: for it goes on to deny this
possibility.</p>

<h3 id="FinRefD1183">6.7 The Final Refutation of <em>D1</em>: 183c4&ndash;187a8</h3>

<p>
Socrates completes his refutation of the thesis that knowledge is
perception by bringing a twelfth and final objection, directed against
<em>D1</em> itself rather than its Protagorean or Heracleitean
interpretations. This objection says that the mind makes use of a
range of concepts which it could not have acquired, and which do not
operate, through the senses: e.g., &ldquo;existence,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sameness,&rdquo; &ldquo;difference.&rdquo; So there is a part
of thought, and hence of knowledge, which has nothing to do with
perception. Therefore knowledge is not perception.</p>

<p>
These concepts are the <em>koina</em>, or common notions/properties.
The introduction of the <em>koina</em> is absolutely crucial for the
continuation of the dialogue, as it raises the decisive issue of the
propositional character of knowledge (see Ferrari 2002 and Ioppolo
2007). As noted, Plato (182d ff.) has already addressed language,
concluding that universal flux negates the possibility of language
(see Giovannetti 2022, Part 2), whose truth lies in anchoring things
through names (in fact, beyond names, Plato&mdash;183a-b&mdash;also
rejects the ability to say &ldquo;thus&rdquo;/<em>hout&ocirc;</em> or
&ldquo;not thus&rdquo;/<em>ouch hout&ocirc;</em>). Socrates now delves
further into this issue. Much debate has arisen regarding the nature
of the <em>koina</em> and, in particular, their identification with
Platonic Forms. It is worth noting that the relationship between the
<em>koina</em> and the Forms is not explicitly drawn in the text.
Here, it is merely suggested that these properties cannot have an
empirical origin, as being, equality, inequality, identity, otherness,
similarity, or dissimilarity are not properties we directly perceive.
Rather, they are notions the soul can discern on its own. Importantly,
among the <em>koina</em>, Plato also mentions non-being (185d: <em>to
m&ecirc; einai</em>), suggesting that these are unlikely to be Forms,
since a Form of non-being does not exist. Nonetheless, this argument
is not conclusive, given that, aside from non-being, Plato affirms the
existence of the other <em>koina</em>. If these <em>koina</em> did not
exist within the soul to some degree, not only would judgment (and
therefore any true or false opinion/proposition) be impossible, but we
would also lack a basis for understanding that perception itself does
not grasp similarity directly but perceives that one thing resembles
another, just as it does not apprehend &ldquo;green&rdquo; in itself
but rather a thing that is green. As noted (Trabattoni 2018,
XCVII&ndash;C), considered in this way, the <em>koina</em> are not
Platonic Forms but universal concepts expressible in a judgment.
Moreover, the doctrine of the <em>koina</em> illustrates that
knowledge cannot be mere perception, as perception alone does not
judge and is therefore incapable of producing a judgment. This leads
to the introduction of the soul. Through the <em>koina</em>, Socrates
appears to conclude that if one relies solely on the sensory and
empirical realm, knowledge in any form becomes impossible. In short,
sensory perception alone cannot yield knowledge of the sensible;
rather, the propositional knowledge of the sensible requires certain
universal concepts (such as being), whose origin lies in the soul and
not in the sensory realm. From this perspective, the function of the
<em>koina</em> is not so distant from that of the Platonic Forms.</p>

<p>
Unitarians and Revisionists will read this last argument against
<em>D1</em> in line with their general orientations. Unitarians will
suggest that Socrates&rsquo; range of concepts common to the senses is
a list of Forms. They will point to the similarities between the image
of the senses as soldiers in a wooden horse that Socrates offers at
184d1 ff. (this image plays a crucial role for Socrates in presenting
the concept of the soul, which is also viewed as capable of organizing
and processing perceptual information), and the picture of a
Heracleitean self, existing only in its awareness of particular
perceptions, that he drew at 156&ndash;160.</p>

<p>
Revisionists will retort that there are important differences between
the Heracleitean self and the wooden-horse self, differences that show
that Heracleiteanism is no longer in force in 184&ndash;187. They will
insist that the view of perception in play in 184&ndash;187 is
Plato&rsquo;s own non-Heracleitean view of perception. Thus Burnyeat
1990: 55&ndash;56 argues that, since Heracleiteanism has been refuted
by 184, &ldquo;the organs and subjects dealt with [in the Wooden Horse
passage] are the ordinary stable kind which continue in being from one
moment to the next.&rdquo; On the other hand, notice that
Plato&rsquo;s equivalent for Burnyeat&rsquo;s &ldquo;organs and
subjects&rdquo; is the single word <em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> (184d2).
On its own, the word can mean either &ldquo;senses&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sensings&rdquo;; but it seems significant that it was the word
Plato used at 156b1 for one of the two sorts of Heracleitean
&ldquo;offspring.&rdquo; Plato speaks of the <em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em>
concealed &ldquo;as if within a Wooden Horse&rdquo; as <em>pollai
tines</em> (184d1), &ldquo;indefinitely many.&rdquo; But while there
are indefinitely many Heracleitean <em>sensings</em>, there are not,
of course, indefinitely many <em>senses</em>. Indeed even the claim
that we have <em>many</em> senses (<em>pollai</em>), rather than
<em>several</em> (<em>enioi</em>, <em>tines</em>), does not sound
quite right, either in English or in Greek. This is perhaps why most
translators, assuming that <em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> means
&ldquo;senses,&rdquo; put &ldquo;a number of senses&rdquo; for
<em>pollai tines aisth&ecirc;seis</em>. Perhaps this is a mistake, and
what <em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> means here is &ldquo;Heracleitean
sensings.&rdquo; If so, this explains how the
<em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> inside any given Wooden Horse can be
<em>pollai tines.</em></p>

<p>
If the <em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> in the Wooden Horse are Heracleitean
<em>sensings</em>, not ordinary, un-Heracleitean <em>senses</em>, this
supports the Unitarian idea that 184&ndash;187 is contrasting
Heracleitean perceiving of particulars with Platonic knowing of the
Forms (or knowing of particulars <em>via</em>, and <em>in terms
of</em>, the Forms).</p>

<p>
Another piece of evidence pointing in the same direction is the
similarity between Plato&rsquo;s list of the &ldquo;common
notions&rdquo; at <em>Theaetetus</em> 186a and closely contemporary
lists that he gives of the Forms, such as the list of Forms
(<em>likeness</em>, <em>multitude</em>, <em>rest</em> and their
opposites) given at <em>Parmenides</em> 129d, with ethical additions
at <em>Parmenides</em> 130b. There are also the <em>megista
gen&ecirc;</em> (&ldquo;greatest kinds&rdquo;) of <em>Sophist</em>
254b&ndash;258e (<em>being</em>, <em>sameness</em>,
<em>otherness</em>, <em>rest</em> and <em>change</em>); though whether
these <em>gen&ecirc;</em> are Forms is controversial.</p>

<h2 id="SecDefD2KnoTruJud187">7. Second Definition (<em>D2</em>): &ldquo;Knowledge is True Judgement&rdquo;: 187b&ndash;201c</h2>

<p>
151&ndash;187 has considered and rejected the proposal that knowledge
is perception. Sometimes in 151&ndash;187 &ldquo;perception&rdquo;
seems to mean &ldquo;immediate sensory awareness&rdquo;; at other
times it seems to mean &ldquo;judgements made <em>about</em> immediate
sensory awareness.&rdquo; The fact remains that the second
response/definition of scientific knowledge
(<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>), that is, true judgment or opinion
(<em>al&#275;th&#275;s doxa</em>), introduces the role of the soul
(see Dixsaut 2002, Brancacci 2019 and Robinson 2020) and, especially,
the problem of the propositional or, at least, linguistic nature of
knowledge, as already anticipated by the <em>koina</em> (the so-called
common notions). The relationship between perception and opinion is
clearly addressed in other parts of the Platonic <em>corpus</em> (see,
for example, <em>Sophist</em> 264a-b and <em>Timaeus</em> 28a and c;
also cf. Aristotle, <em>De Anima</em> II.2, 413b). However, in the
context of the <em>Theaetetus</em>, this relationship is not one of
identity. Perception primarily indicates a kind of awareness of the
perceptual act, which does not automatically translate into a
cognitive judgment. Here, it is precisely the propositional nature of
knowledge that becomes the focus of this part of the dialogue. A bit
further on, in the famous passage where Socrates explains what it
means to think (<em>dianoeisthai</em>, 189e)&mdash;that is, a
discourse (<em>logos</em>) that the soul holds with itself&mdash;it is
stated with great clarity that forming an opinion (<em>to
doxazein</em>) is a kind of speaking (<em>legein</em>), and that an
opinion (<em>doxa</em>) is an uttered discourse (<em>logos
eir&ecirc;menos</em>). The proposal that &ldquo;Knowledge is immediate
sensory awareness&rdquo; is rejected as incoherent: &ldquo;Knowledge
is not to be found in our bodily experiences, but in our reasonings
about those experiences&rdquo; (186d2). The proposal that
&ldquo;Knowledge is judgement about immediate sensory awareness&rdquo;
raises the question <em>how</em> judgements, or beliefs, can emerge
from immediate sensory awareness. Answering this question is the main
aim in 187&ndash;201.</p>

<p>
Empiricists claim that perception, which in itself has no cognitive
content, is the source of all beliefs, which essentially have
cognitive content&mdash;which are by their very nature candidates for
truth or falsity. So unless we can explain how beliefs can be true or
false, we cannot explain how there can be beliefs at all. Hence
Plato&rsquo;s interest in the question of false belief. This is an
important point that must be emphasized, given its somewhat
paradoxical nature. Any opinion can be true or false in itself; it
should be noted that in the section of the dialogue devoted to
perception, the issue of the truth or falsity of the perceptual act
was not addressed with the same theoretical depth seen in this part.
This is because truth and falsity belong primarily to judgment. At
this point, if knowledge is true opinion, then one must also justify
the possibility of false opinion: in a somewhat paradoxical manner, it
is not knowledge but rather the possibility of falsity that becomes
the main theme of this part of the dialogue. The impossibility of
justifying falsity will render even the second definition of knowledge
aporetic.</p>

<p>
What Plato wants to show in 187&ndash;201 is that there is no way for
the empiricist to construct contentful belief from contentless sensory
awareness alone. The corollary is, of course, that we need something
else besides sensory awareness to explain belief. In modern terms, we
need irreducible <em>semantic properties.</em> In Plato&rsquo;s terms,
we need the Forms.</p>

<p>
In pursuit of this strategy of argument in 187&ndash;201, Plato
rejects in turn five possible empiricist explanations of how there can
be false belief. In the First Puzzle (188a&ndash;c) he proposes a
basic difficulty for any empiricist. Then he argues that no move
available to the empiricist circumvents this basic difficulty, however
much complexity it may introduce (the other four Puzzles:
188d&ndash;201b). The Fifth Puzzle collapses back into the Third
Puzzle, and the Third Puzzle collapses back into the First. The
proposal that gives us the Fourth Puzzle is disproved by the
counter-examples that make the Fifth Puzzle necessary. As for the
Second Puzzle, Plato deploys this to show how empiricism has the
disabling drawback that it turns an outrageous sophistical argument
into a valid disproof of the possibility of at least some sorts of
false belief.</p>

<p>
Thus 187&ndash;201 continues the critique of perception-based accounts
of knowledge that 151&ndash;187 began. Contrary to what some&mdash;for
instance Cornford&mdash;have thought, it is no digression from the
main path of the <em>Theaetetus</em>. On the contrary, the discussion
of false belief is the most obvious way forward.</p>

<p>
As Plato stresses throughout the dialogue, it is Theaetetus who is
caught in this problem about false belief. It is not Socrates, nor
Plato. There is clear evidence at <em>Philebus</em> 38c ff. that false
belief (at least of some sorts) was no problem at all to Plato himself
(at least at some points in his career). Plato&rsquo;s question is not
&ldquo;How on earth can there be false judgement?&rdquo; Rather it is
&ldquo;What sort of background assumptions about knowledge must
Theaetetus be making, given that he is puzzled by the question how
there can be false judgement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Is it only false judgements of <em>identity</em> that are at issue in
187&ndash;201, or is it <em>any</em> false judgement? One
interpretation of 187&ndash;201 says that it is only about false
judgements of misidentification. Call this view
<em>misidentificationism</em>. The main alternative interpretation of
187&ndash;201 says that it is about any and every false judgement.
Call this view <em>anti-misidentificationism</em>. The present
discussion assumes the truth of anti-misidentificationism; see
Chappell 2005: 154&ndash;157 for the arguments.</p>

<p>
I turn to the detail of the five proposals about how to explain false
belief that occupy Stephanus pages 187 to 200 of the dialogue. In the
section we will analyze below, the two fundamental epistemological
models are presented: the Wax Tablet and the Aviary.</p>

<h3 id="PuzMis187">7.1 The Puzzle of Misidentification: 187e5&ndash;188c8</h3>

<p>
The first proposal about how to explain the possibility of false
belief is the proposal that false belief occurs when someone
misidentifies one thing as another. To believe or judge falsely is to
judge, for some two objects <em>O1</em> and <em>O2</em>, that
<em>O1</em> is <em>O2</em>.</p>

<p>
I cannot mistake <em>X</em> for <em>Y</em> unless I am able to
formulate thoughts about <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. But I will not be
able to formulate thoughts about <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> unless I am
<em>acquainted</em> with <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. Being acquainted
with <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> means <em>knowing</em> <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em>; and anyone who knows <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> will not
mistake them for each other.</p>

<p>
Why think this a genuine puzzle? There seem to be plenty of everyday
cases where knowing some thing in no way prevents us from sometimes
mistaking that thing for something else. One example in the dialogue
itself is at 191b (cp. 144c5). It is perfectly possible for someone
who knows Socrates to see Theaetetus in the distance, and wrongly
think that Theaetetus is Socrates. The First Puzzle does not even get
off the ground, unless we can see why our knowledge of <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em> should guarantee us against mistakes about <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em>. Who is the puzzle of 188a&ndash;c supposed to be a puzzle
<em>for</em>?</p>

<p>
If (as is suggested in e.g. Chappell 2005, <em>ad loc.</em>)
187&ndash;201 is an indirect demonstration that false belief cannot be
explained by empiricism (whether this means a developed philosophical
theory, or the instinctive empiricism of some people&rsquo;s common
sense), then it is likely that the First Puzzle states the basic
difficulty for empiricism, to which the other four Puzzles look for
alternative solutions. The nature of this basic difficulty is not
fully, or indeed at all, explained by the First Puzzle. We have to
read on and watch the development of the argument of 187&ndash;201 to
see exactly what the problem is that gives the First Puzzle its
bite.</p>

<h3 id="SecPuzAboFalBelBelWhaNot188">7.2 Second Puzzle About False Belief: &ldquo;Believing What is Not&rdquo;: 188c10&ndash;189b9</h3>

<p>
The second proposal says that false judgement is believing or judging
<em>ta</em> <em>m&ecirc; onta</em>, &ldquo;things that are not&rdquo;
or &ldquo;what is not.&rdquo; Socrates observes that if &ldquo;what is
not&rdquo; is understood as it often was by Greek thinkers, as meaning
&ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; then this proposal leads us straight into the
sophistical absurdity that false beliefs are the same thing as beliefs
about nothing (i.e., contentless beliefs). But there can be no beliefs
about nothing; and there are false beliefs; so false belief
isn&rsquo;t the same thing as believing what is not.</p>

<p>
Some think the Second Puzzle a mere sophistry. Bostock 1988: 165
distinguishes two versions of the sophistry: &ldquo;On one version, to
believe falsely is&hellip; to believe what is not &lsquo;just by
itself&rsquo;; on the other version, it is to believe what is not
&lsquo;about one of the things which are&rsquo;&rdquo;. The argument
of the first version, according to Bostock, &ldquo;is just that there
is no such thing as what is not (the case); it is a mere nonentity.
But just as you cannot perceive a nonentity, so equally you cannot
believe one either.&rdquo; Bostock proposes the following solution to
this problem: &ldquo;We may find it natural to reply to this argument
by distinguishing&hellip; propositions [from] facts, situations,
states of affairs, and so on. Then we shall say that the things that
are believed are propositions, not facts&hellip; so a false belief is
not directed at a non-existent.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="ThiPuzAboFalBelAll189">7.3 Third Puzzle About False Belief: <em>Allodoxia</em>: 189b10&ndash;190e4</h3>

<p>
Literally translated, the third proposal about how to explain the
possibility of false belief says that false belief occurs &ldquo;when
someone exchanges (<em>antallaxamenos</em>) in his understanding one
of the things that are with another of the things that are, and says
<em>is</em>&rdquo; (189b12&ndash;c2; on the <em>allodoxia</em> see at
least Crivelli 1998).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best way to read this very unclear statement is as meaning
that the distinctive addition in the third proposal is the notion of
<em>inadvertency</em>. The point of Socrates&rsquo; argument is that
this addition does not help us to obtain an adequate account of false
belief because thought (<em>dianoia</em>) has to be understood as an
inner process, with objects that we are always fully and explicitly
conscious of. If we are fully and explicitly conscious of all the
objects of our thoughts, and if the objects of our thoughts are as
simple as empiricism takes them to be, there is simply no room for
inadvertency. But without inadvertency, the third proposal simply
collapses back into the first proposal, which has already been
refuted.</p>

<p>
In the discussion of the Fourth and Fifth Puzzles, Socrates and
Theaetetus together work out the detail of two empiricist attempts to
explain just this. It then becomes clearer why Plato does not think
that the empiricist can explain the difference between fully explicit
and not-fully-explicit speech or thought. Although this is not
explicitly stated in the text, it is likely that Plato thinks that, to
explain this, we have to abandon altogether the empiricist conception
of thought as the concatenation (somehow) of semantically inert simple
mental images. Instead, we have to understand thought as the syntactic
concatenation of the genuine semantic entities, the <em>Forms</em>.
Mistakes in thought will then be comprehensible as mistakes either
about the logical interrelations of the Forms, or about the correct
application of the Forms to the sensory phenomena (see Fronterotta
2022).</p>

<h3 id="FouPuzAboFalBelWaxTab190">7.4 Fourth Puzzle About False Belief: the Wax Tablet: 190e5&ndash;196c5</h3>

<p>
The Wax Tablet passage offers us a more explicit account of the nature
of thought, and its relationship with perception (see Aronadio 2022).
The story now on offer says explicitly that perception relates to
thought roughly as Humean &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; relate to Humean
&ldquo;ideas&rdquo; (191d; compare Hume, <em>First Enquiry</em> II).
The objects of perception, as before, are a succession of
constantly-changing immediate awarenesses. The objects of thought, it
is now added, are those objects of perception to which we have chosen
to give a measure of stability by imprinting them on the wax tablets
in our minds. (The image of memory as writing in the mind had currency
in Greek thought well before Plato&rsquo;s time: see e.g. Aeschylus,
<em>Eumenides</em> 275.) The Wax Tablet is closely connected to
memory&mdash;it is, in fact, a divine gift from Mnemosyne (191d; see
Cambiano 2007)&mdash;and the impressions present on it legitimize the
very possibility of remembering, following a general framework later
adopted by both Aristotle (see, e.g., <em>De Memoria</em>
450a29&ndash;34; <em>De Anima</em> II.12, 424a17&ndash;21, III.4,
429b31&ndash;430a2, and III.12, 435a1&ndash;10) and the Stoics (see,
e.g., the Sextus Empiricus passages collected in <em>Stoicorum Veterum
Fragmenta</em> I 484 von Arnim). These impressions pertain not only to
<em>aisth&ecirc;seis</em> (perceptions) but also to <em>ennoiai</em>
(concepts/notions); in short, such &ldquo;molds&rdquo; have both
perceptual and intellectual content. The term Socrates uses to
indicate the impression of perceptions and thoughts/notions is
<em>apotypousthai</em>, a verb containing the noun <em>typos</em>,
which specifically denotes the &ldquo;cast&rdquo; or the imprint left
on the Wax Tablet. Plato (191c-d) is careful to emphasize that the
quality of the wax is not uniform but can vary in purity and hardness;
the quality of the wax determines the quality of the impressions and,
consequently, the greater or lesser ability for them to be retained in
memory.</p>

<p>
This new spelling-out of the empiricist account of thought seems to
offer new resources for explaining the possibility of false belief.
The new explanation can say that false belief occurs when there is a
mismatch, not between two objects of <em>thought</em>, nor between two
objects of <em>perception</em>, but between one object of each
type.</p>

<p>
This proposal faces a simple and decisive objection. No one disputes
that there are false beliefs that <em>cannot</em> be explained as
mismatches of thought and perception: e.g., false beliefs about
arithmetic. The Wax Tablet does not explain how such false beliefs
happen; indeed it entails that they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> happen. Such
mistakes are confusions of two objects of thought, and the Wax Tablet
model does not dispute the earlier finding that there can be no such
confusions. So the Wax Tablet model fails.</p>

<h3 id="FifPuzAboFalBelAvi196">7.5 Fifth Puzzle About False Belief: The Aviary: 196d1&ndash;200d4</h3>

<p>
If we had a solution to the very basic problem about how the
empiricist can get any content at all out of perception, then the
fourth proposal might show how the empiricist could explain false
belief involving perception. The fifth and last proposal about how to
explain the possibility of false belief attempts to remedy the fourth
proposal&rsquo;s incapacity&mdash;which Plato says refutes it,
196c5&ndash;7&mdash;to deal with cases of false belief involving no
perception, such as false arithmetical beliefs.</p>

<p>
It attempts this by deploying a distinction between knowledge that
someone merely <em>has</em> (latent knowledge; the Greek verb is
<em>kekt&ecirc;sthai</em>) and knowledge that he is actually
<em>using</em> (active knowledge; the Greek verb is <em>echein</em>;
on this difference see too Aristotle, <em>De Anima</em>
II.1)<em>.</em> (Perhaps Plato is now exploring &ldquo;the
intermediate stages between knowing and not knowing&rdquo; mentioned
at 188a2&ndash;3.) The suggestion is that false belief occurs when
someone wants to use some item of latent knowledge in his active
thought, but makes a wrong selection from among the items that he
knows latently.</p>

<p>
If this proposal worked it would cover false arithmetical belief. But
the proposal does not work, because it is regressive. If there is a
problem about the very possibility of confusing two things, it is no
answer to this problem to suppose that for each thing there is a
corresponding item of knowledge, and that what happens when two
<em>things</em> are confused is really that the two corresponding
<em>items</em> <em>of</em> <em>knowledge</em> are confused
(200a&ndash;b).</p>

<p>
The Aviary rightly tries to explain false belief by complicating our
picture of belief (see Ara&uacute;jo 2020 and Maffi 2022). But it
complicates in the wrong way and the wrong place. It is no help to
complicate the story by throwing in further objects of the same sort
as the objects that created the difficulty about false belief in the
first place. What is needed is a different sort of object for thought:
a kind of object that can be thought of under different aspects (say,
as &ldquo;the sum of 5 and 7,&rdquo; or as &ldquo;the integer
12&rdquo;). There are no such aspects to the &ldquo;items of
knowledge&rdquo; that the Aviary deals in. As with the conception of
the objects of thought and knowledge that we found in the Wax Tablet,
it is this lack of aspects that dooms the Aviary&rsquo;s conception of
the objects of knowledge too. Like the Wax Tablet, the Aviary founders
on its own inability to accommodate the point that thought cannot
consist merely in the presentation of a series of inert &ldquo;objects
of thought.&rdquo; Whether these objects of thought are mental images
drawn from perception or something else, the thinking is not so much
in the objects of thought as in what is <em>done</em> with those
objects (186d2&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
We may illustrate this by asking: When the dunce who supposes that 5 +
7 = 11 decides to activate some item of knowledge to be the answer to
&ldquo;What is the sum of 5 and 7?,&rdquo; <em>which</em> item of
knowledge does he thus decide to activate? At first only two answers
seem possible: either he decides to activate 12, or he decides to
activate 11. If he decides to activate 12, then we cannot explain the
fact that what he actually does is activate 11, except by saying that
he mistakes the item of knowledge which is 11 for the item of
knowledge which is 12. But this mistake is the very mistake ruled out
as impossible right at the beginning of the inquiry into false belief
(188a&ndash;c). Alternatively, if he decides to activate 11, then we
have to ask <em>why</em> he decides to do this. The most plausible
answer to that question is: &ldquo;Because he believes falsely that 5
+ 7 = 11.&rdquo; But as noted above, if he has already formed this
false belief, <em>within</em> the account that is supposed to explain
false belief, then a regress looms.</p>

<p>
In fact, the correct answer to the question &ldquo;Which item of
knowledge does the dunce decide to activate?&rdquo; is neither
&ldquo;12&rdquo; nor &ldquo;11.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;<em>that
number</em> which is the sum of 5 and 7.&rdquo; But this answer does
not save the Aviary theorist from the dilemma just pointed out; for it
is not available to him. To be able to give this answer, the Aviary
theorist would have to be able to distinguish &ldquo;that number which
is the sum of 5 and 7&rdquo; from &ldquo;12.&rdquo; But since
&ldquo;12&rdquo; <em>is &ldquo;</em>that number which is the sum of 5
and 7,&rdquo; this distinction cannot be made by anyone who takes the
objects of thought to be simple in the way that the Aviary theorist
seems to.</p>

<p>
To conclude. The two epistemological models are not identical: the
first appears as a more passive model compared to the second. In the
latter, there is greater dynamism due to the increased involvement of
the knowing subject, who must grasp the correct &ldquo;bird&rdquo;
(i.e., the correct piece of knowledge). In any case, both models fail
because neither is able to account for the possibility of error or, in
Platonic terms, <em>allodoxia</em>: how, indeed, is it possible to
confuse one piece of knowledge with another if both are forms of
knowledge? If the models do not legitimize the possibility of error,
they do not truly explain what knowledge is, even though they
implicitly presuppose it. The most challenging issue is to understand
why these models fail. The essential point is that if we assume that
the knowledge in question is <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> (equivalent
to <em>sophia</em>), or absolute knowledge, and that the Wax Tablet
and the Aviary contain absolute forms of knowledge, then it is evident
that error would be impossible. Yet, in the concrete reality of
things, error does occur (see 195c ff. and 199b ff.), though it is
philosophically impossible to justify if the knowledge represented by
the wax block and aviary models is absolute. If the subject receives
or grasps knowledge, they cannot, in any case, fall into error.
Consequently, not only knowledge but also error are difficult to
explain (see Fronterotta 2022, Trabattoni 2024 and Zucca 2024).</p>

<p>
At 199e1 ff. Theaetetus suggests an amendment to the Aviary. This is
that we might have items of <em>ignorance</em> in our heads as well as
items of knowledge. As Socrates remarks, these ignorance-birds can be
confused with knowledge-birds in just the same way as knowledge-birds
can be confused with each other. So the addition does not help. The
addition made by Theaetetus, although paradoxical, is significant as
it demonstrates that Socrates&rsquo; young interlocutor has fully
understood the reason for the failure of the two epistemological
models. According to Theaetetus, error can be justified if, within the
aviary&mdash;within our soul&mdash;not only knowledge but also forms
of non-knowledge (<em>anepist&ecirc;mosynai</em>) are &ldquo;flying
about.&rdquo; From this perspective, error occurs when the subject
grasps a piece of non-knowledge instead of knowledge. This brings us
back, to some extent, to the previous problem, as it remains difficult
to explain why the subject would mistake non-knowledge for knowledge.
However, aside from this issue, Theaetetus has grasped that the reason
error cannot be justified lies precisely in the fact that only
knowledge is present in the Wax Tablet and the Aviary. Thus, the only
way (though still problematic, given the recurring issue of
<em>allodoxia</em>) to legitimize error is to place non-knowledge
within the soul. But for Socrates, this is absurd, because the one who
grasps a piece of non-knowledge will think they have actually grasped
knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="FinRefD2200">7.6 The Final Refutation of <em>D2</em>: 200d5&ndash;201c7</h3>

<p>
At 200d&ndash;201c Socrates argues more directly against <em>D2</em>.
He offers a counter-example to the thesis that knowledge is true
belief. A skilled lawyer can bring jurymen into a state of true belief
without bringing them into a state of knowledge; so knowledge and true
belief are different states.</p>

<p>
The jury argument seems to be a counter-example not only to
<em>D2</em> but also to <em>D3</em>, the thesis that knowledge is true
belief <em>with an account</em> (provided we allow that the jury
&ldquo;have an account&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
A third problem about the jury argument is that Plato seems to offer
two incompatible explanations of why the jury don&rsquo;t know: first
that they have only a limited time to hear the arguments (201b3,
172e1); and second that their judgement is second-hand (201b9).</p>

<h2 id="ThiDefD3KnoTruJudAcc201">8. Third Definition (<em>D3</em>): &ldquo;Knowledge is True Judgement With an Account&rdquo;: 201d&ndash;210a</h2>

<p>
Theaetetus&rsquo; third proposal about how to knowledge is
(<em>D3</em>) that it is true belief with an account (<em>meta logou
al&ecirc;th&ecirc; doxan</em>).</p>

<p>
<em>D3</em> apparently does nothing at all to solve the main problems
that <em>D2</em> faced. Besides the jurymen counter-example just
noted, 187&ndash;201 showed that we could not define knowledge as
<em>true</em> belief unless we had an account of <em>false</em>
belief. This problem has not just evaporated in 201&ndash;210. It will
remain as long as we propose to define knowledge as true belief plus
anything. Significantly, this does not seem to bother Plato&mdash;as
we might expect if Plato is not even trying to offer an acceptable
definition of knowledge, but is rather undermining unacceptable
definitions.</p>

<p>
One crucial question about <em>Theaetetus</em> 201&ndash;210 is the
question whether the argument is concerned with objectual or
propositional knowledge. This is a basic and central division among
interpretations of the whole passage 201&ndash;210, but it is hard to
discuss it properly without getting into the detail of the Dream
Theory: see section 8.1.</p>

<p>
A second question, which arises often elsewhere in the
<em>Theaetetus</em>, is whether the argument&rsquo;s appearance of
<em>aporia</em> reflects genuine uncertainty on Plato&rsquo;s part, or
is rather a kind of literary device. Is Plato thinking aloud, trying
to clarify his own view about the nature of knowledge, as Revisionists
suspect? Or is he using an aporetic argument only to smoke out his
opponents, as Unitarians think?</p>

<p>
The evidence favours the latter reading. There are a significant
number of other passages where something very like Theaetetus&rsquo;
claim (<em>D3</em>) that knowledge is &ldquo;true belief with an
account&rdquo; is not only discussed, but actually defended (as will
be discussed in the <em>Conclusion</em>, this is a crucial element
that cannot be overlooked for understanding the philosophical meaning
of the entire dialogue): for instance, <em>Meno</em> 98a2,
<em>Phaedo</em> 76b5&ndash;6, 97d&ndash;99d2, <em>Symposium</em>
202a5&ndash;9, <em>Republic</em> 534b3&ndash;7, and <em>Timaeus</em>
51e5. So it appears that, in the <em>Theaetetus</em>, Plato cannot be
genuinely puzzled about what knowledge can be. Nor can he genuinely
doubt his own former confidence in one version of <em>D3</em>. If he
does have a genuine doubt or puzzle of this sort, it is simply
incredible that he should say what he does say in 201&ndash;210
without also expressing it.</p>

<p>
What Plato does in 201&ndash;210 is: present a picture
(Socrates&rsquo; Dream) of how things may be if <em>D3</em> is true
(201c&ndash;202c); raise objections to the Dream theory which are said
(206b12) to be decisive (202c&ndash;206c); and present and reject
three further suggestions about the meaning of <em>logos</em>, and so
three more versions of <em>D3</em> (206c&ndash;210a). But none of
these four interpretations of <em>D3</em> is Plato&rsquo;s own earlier
version of <em>D3</em>, which says that knowledge = true belief with
an account <em>of the reason why the true belief is true</em>. If what
Plato wants to tell us in <em>Theaetetus</em> 201&ndash;210 is that he
no longer accepts <em>any</em> version of <em>D3</em>, not even his
own version, then it is extraordinary that he does not even mention
his own version, concentrating instead on versions of <em>D3</em> so
different from Plato&rsquo;s version as to be obviously irrelevant to
its refutation.</p>

<h3 id="DreSoc201">8.1 The Dream of Socrates: 201d8&ndash;202d7</h3>

<p>
Rather as Socrates offered to develop <em>D1</em> in all sorts of
surprising directions, so now he offers to develop <em>D3</em> into a
sophisticated theory of knowledge. This theory, usually known as the
&ldquo;Dream of Socrates&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Dream Theory,&rdquo;
posits two kinds of existents, complexes and simples, and proposes
that &ldquo;an account&rdquo; means &ldquo;an account of the complexes
that analyses them into their simple components.&rdquo; Thus
&ldquo;knowledge of <em>x</em>&rdquo; turns out to mean &ldquo;true
belief about <em>x</em> with an account of <em>x</em> that analyses
<em>x</em> into its simple components&rdquo; (see the studies
collected by Mazzara-Napoli 2010 and Tian 2013).</p>

<p>
Taken as a general account of knowledge, the Dream Theory implies that
knowledge is only of complexes, and that there can be no knowledge of
simples. Socrates attacks this implication. It is far from unlikely
that Plato&rsquo;s dream doctrine was developed not solely but also as
a response to Antisthenes, particularly his doctrine of the
<em>oikeios logos</em> (the &ldquo;proper discourse&rdquo;). The
Socratic philosopher Antisthenes was a staunch opponent of Plato, and
one of his most explicitly anti-Platonic works is the
<em>Sath&#333;n</em> (cf. Diogenes Laertius III 35 = <em>Socratis et
Socraticorum Reliquiae</em> V A 148 Giannantoni). Antisthenes was
especially critical of the Platonic Form, which he understood as a
universal entirely non-existent in concrete reality, perceiving it
instead as merely a mental construct. Famously, Antisthenes argued
against Plato by saying that he could see a horse but not
&ldquo;horseness&rdquo; (cf. the texts collected in <em>Socratis et
Socraticorum Reliquiae</em> V A 149 Giannantoni). Antisthenes
maintained that not qualities but <em>quale</em>&mdash;that is,
concrete, qualified individuals&mdash;possess actual existence. In
this regard, it is noteworthy that in the <em>Theaetetus</em>
(182a-b), Plato not only likely introduces the term
<em>poiot&ecirc;s</em> (quality) into philosophical language but also
distinguishes it from <em>poion ti</em> (&ldquo;a certain
<em>quale</em>&rdquo;; cf. Brancacci 1990: 175&ndash;182). This focus
on the determinacy of the <em>quale</em> (the concretely
qualified/determined individual) forms the foundation of
Antisthenes&rsquo;s linguistic analysis of names, which plays a
central role in his philosophy (cfr. Brancacci 1990: 227&ndash;262).
According to Antisthenes, the Form (understood Platonically as
essence) cannot be defined (the <em>oikeios logos</em> cannot apply to
it) because something absolutely unitary, like the Platonic Form,
cannot be captured by a discourse necessarily composed of multiple
names. Definitional discourse, by contrast, pertains not to the unity
of essence (which is indefinable) but to the <em>quale</em>. For
example, one cannot define what silver is (that is, its essence) but
can only describe what kind of thing it is, such as saying that it is
like tin (cf. Ps.-Alexander <em>In Aristot. Metaph.</em> p. 554 20-22
= <em>Socratis et Socraticorum Reliquiae</em> V A 150
Giannantoni).</p>

<p>
The so-called dream doctrine concerns precisely the problem of the
nameability/definability of elements and their compounds, and it is
highly likely that Plato had Antisthenes&rsquo;s doctrine of
definition in mind when formulating this theory.</p>

<p>
A common question about the Dream Theory is whether it is concerned
with objectual or propositional knowledge. Those who take the Dream
Theory to be concerned with <em>propositional</em> knowledge include
Ryle 1990: 27&ndash;30: &ldquo;from 201 onwards Plato concentrates on
&lsquo;know&rsquo; (<em>conna&icirc;tre</em>): [Socrates&rsquo; Dream]
is a logician&rsquo;s theory, a theory about the composition of truths
and falsehoods.&rdquo; Those who take the Dream Theory to be concerned
with <em>objectual</em> knowledge include White 1976: 177, and Crombie
1963: II: 41&ndash;42; also Bostock 1988. A third way of taking the
Dream Theory, which may well be the most promising interpretation, is
to take it as a <em>Logical Atomism</em>: as a theory which founds an
account of propositional structure on an account of the concatenation
of simple objects of experience or acquaintance such as &ldquo;sense
data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
If this is the point of the Dream Theory, then the best answer to the
question &ldquo;Whose is the Dream Theory?&rdquo; is &ldquo;It belongs
to the empiricist whom Plato is attacking,&rdquo; without thereby
excluding the more than reasonable historical possibility that Plato
is responding to Antisthenes&rsquo;s philosophy, particularly his
doctrine of definition (see M&aacute;rsico 2020).</p>

<h3 id="CriDreThe202">8.2 Critique of the Dream Theory: 202d8&ndash;206c2</h3>

<p>
The Dream Theory says that knowledge of <em>O</em> is true belief
about <em>O</em> plus an account of <em>O</em>&rsquo;s composition. If
<em>O</em> is not composite, <em>O</em> cannot be known, but only
&ldquo;perceived&rdquo; (202b6).</p>

<p>
Socrates&rsquo; main strategy in 202d8&ndash;206c2 is to attack the
Dream&rsquo;s claim that complexes and elements are distinguishable in
respect of knowability. To this end he deploys a dilemma. A complex,
say a syllable, is either (a) no more than its elements (its letters),
or (b) something over and above those elements (this point inevitably
recalls a famous passage at the end of Book Z of the
<em>Metaphysics</em> (17, 1041b11 ff.), where Aristotle himself uses
the example of syllables and letters.).</p>

<p>
202d8&ndash;203e1 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from
alternative (a), that a complex is no more than its elements. If I am
to know a syllable <em>SO</em>, and that syllable is no more than its
elements, then I cannot know the syllable <em>SO</em> without also
knowing its elements <em>S</em> and <em>O</em>. Indeed, it seems that
coming to know the parts <em>S</em> and <em>O</em> is both necessary
and sufficient for coming to know the syllable <em>SO</em>. But if
that is right, and if the letter/syllable relation models the
element/complex relation, then if any complex is <em>knowable</em>,
its elements will be knowable too; and if any complex&rsquo;s elements
are <em>unknowable</em>, then the complex will be unknowable too. This
result contradicts the Dream Theory.</p>

<p>
203e2&ndash;205e8 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from
alternative (b), that a complex is something over and above its
elements. In that case, to know the syllable is to know something for
which knowledge of the elements is not sufficient. The syllable turns
out to be &ldquo;a single Form that comes to be out of the
fitted-together elements&rdquo; (204a1&ndash;2). But then the syllable
does not have the elements as parts: if it did, that would compromise
its singularity. And if the elements are not the parts of the
syllable, nothing else can be. So the syllable has no parts, which
makes it as simple as an element. Thus if the element is unknowable,
the syllable must be unknowable too. This result contradicts the Dream
Theory too.</p>

<p>
Finally, in 206a1&ndash;c2, Plato makes a further, very simple, point
against the Dream Theory. Our own experience of learning letters and
syllables shows that it is both more basic and more important to know
elements than complexes, not <em>vice versa</em> as the Dream Theory
implies. The thesis that the complexes are knowable, the elements
unknowable, is false to our experience, in which &ldquo;knowledge of
the elements is primary&rdquo; (Burnyeat 1990, 192).</p>

<h3 id="ThrAttUndLog206">8.3 Three Attempts to Understand <em>Logos</em>: 206c2&ndash;210a9</h3>

<p>
The refutation of the Dream Theory&rsquo;s attempt to spell out what
it might be like for <em>D3</em> to be true is followed by three
attempts to give an account of what a <em>logos</em> is. The first
attempt to give an account of &ldquo;account&rdquo; takes
<em>logos</em> just to mean &ldquo;speech&rdquo; or
&ldquo;statement.&rdquo; This is deemed obviously insufficient
(206c1&ndash;206e3).</p>

<p>
A second attempted explanation of &ldquo;<em>logos</em> of O&rdquo;
takes it as &ldquo;enumeration of the elements of <em>O</em>.&rdquo;
The <em>logos</em> is a statement of the <em>elements</em> of the
object of knowledge. You have knowledge of something when, in addition
to your true belief about it, you are able also to &ldquo;go through
the elements&rdquo; of that thing.</p>

<p>
Plato&rsquo;s objection to this proposal (208b) is that it leaves open
the possibility that someone could count as having knowledge of the
name &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; even if they could do no more than write
out the letters of the name &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; in the right
order. Since such a person can enumerate the elements of the complex,
i.e., the letters of the name (207c8&ndash;d1), he has an account.
Since he can arrange those letters in their correct order
(208a9&ndash;10), he also has true belief. For all that, insists
Plato, he does not have knowledge of the name
&ldquo;Theaetetus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Why not, we might ask? To see the answer we should bring in what Plato
says about syllables at 207d8&ndash;208a3. Suppose someone could
enumerate the letters of &ldquo;Theaetetus,&rdquo; and could give
their correct order, and yet knew nothing about syllables. This person
wouldn&rsquo;t count as knowing &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; because he
would have no understanding of the principles that get us from ordered
letters to names. Those principles are principles about <em>how</em>
letters form syllables, and <em>how</em> syllables form names. A
person who can state only the letters of &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; and
their order has no awareness of these principles.</p>

<p>
Knowledge of such bridging principles can reasonably be called
knowledge of <em>why</em> the letters of &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; are
what they are. So it is plausible to suggest that the moral of the
argument is to point us to the need for an account in the sense of an
explanation &ldquo;Why?,&rdquo; and so to the version of <em>D3</em>
that Plato himself accepts.</p>

<p>
The third proposed account of <em>logos</em> says that to give the
<em>logos</em> of <em>O</em> is to cite the <em>s&ecirc;meion</em> or
<em>diaphora</em> of <em>O</em>. In the Wax Tablet passage,
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em> meant &lsquo;imprint&rsquo;; in the present
passage, it means the &lsquo;sign&rsquo; or diagnostic feature wherein
<em>x</em> differs from everything else, or everything else of
<em>O</em>&rsquo;s own kind (For the revival of this concept in the
Academic tradition, cf. Cic., <em>Lucull.</em> 33&ndash;34). So,
presumably, knowledge of (say) Theaetetus consists in true belief
about Theaetetus plus an account of what differentiates Theaetetus
from every other human.</p>

<p>
Socrates offers two objections to this proposal. First, if knowledge
of Theaetetus requires a mention of his <em>s&ecirc;meion</em>, so
does true belief about Theaetetus. Second, to <em>possess</em>
&ldquo;an account of Theaetetus&rsquo; <em>s&ecirc;meion</em>&rdquo;
must mean either (a) having true belief about that
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em>, or else (b) having knowledge of it. But it has
already been pointed out that any true belief, if it is to qualify as
being about Theaetetus at all, must already be true belief about his
<em>s&ecirc;meion.</em> So interpretation (a) has the result that
knowledge of Theaetetus = true belief about Theaetetus&rsquo;
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em> + true belief about Theaetetus&rsquo;
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em>. As for (b): if we want to know what knowledge
is, it is no help to be told that knowledge of <em>O</em> = something
else + <em>knowledge</em> of the <em>s&ecirc;meion</em> of <em>O</em>.
We still need to know what knowledge of the <em>s&ecirc;meion</em> of
<em>O</em> is. Nor will it help us to be launched on a vicious
regress: as we will be if we are told that knowledge of the
<em>s&ecirc;meion</em> of <em>O</em> = something else + knowledge of
the <em>s&ecirc;meion</em> of the <em>s&ecirc;meion</em> of
<em>O</em>.</p>

<p>
This is where the argument ends, and Socrates leaves to meet his
accusers.</p>

<h2 id="Con">9. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The <em>Theaetetus</em> is an extended attack on certain assumptions
and intuitions about knowledge that the intelligent
man-in-the-street&mdash;Theaetetus, for instance&mdash;might find
initially attractive, and which some philosophers known to
Plato&mdash;Protagoras and Heracleitus, for instance&mdash;had worked
up into complex and sophisticated philosophical theories. Basic to all
these assumptions and intuitions, which here have been grouped
together under the name &ldquo;empiricism,&rdquo; is the idea that
knowledge is constructed out of perception and perception alone.</p>

<p>
The first part of the <em>Theaetetus</em> attacks the idea that
knowledge could be simply <em>identified</em> with perception.
Perceptions alone have no semantic/propositional structure. So if this
thesis was true, it would be impossible to state it.</p>

<p>
The second part attacks the suggestion that knowledge can be defined
as true belief, where beliefs are supposed to be
semantically-structured concatenations of sensory impressions. Against
this Plato argues that, unless something can be said to explain
<em>how</em> impressions can be concatenated so as to give them
semantic structure, there is no reason to grant that the distinction
between true and false applies to such beliefs any more than it does
to perceptions. This necessitates the introduction of the soul, given
that perception alone is not capable of verbally expressing a
cognitive judgment.</p>

<p>
Finally, in the third part of the <em>Theaetetus</em>, an attempt is
made to meet this challenge, and present some explanation of how
semantic structures can arise out of mere perceptions or impressions.
The proposed explanation is the Dream Theory, a theory interestingly
comparable to Russellian Logical Atomism, which takes both
propositions and objects to be complexes &ldquo;logically
constructed&rdquo; out of simple sensory impressions. On this
conception, knowledge will come about when someone is capable not only
of using such logical constructions in thought, but of understanding
how they arise from perception.</p>

<p>
Socrates&rsquo; basic objection to this theory is that it still gives
no proper explanation of <em>how</em> this logical construction takes
place. Without such an explanation, there is no good reason to treat
the complexes that are thus logically constructed as anything other
than simples in their own right. We need to know how it can be that,
merely by conjoining perceptions in the right way, we manage to
achieve a degree of semantic structure that (for instance) makes it
possible to <em>refer to things in the world</em>, such as Theaetetus.
But this is not explained simply by listing all the simple perceptions
that are so conjoined. Nor&mdash;and this is where we reach the third
proposal of 208b11&ndash;210a9&mdash;is it explained by fixing on any
of those perceptions in particular, and taking it to be the special
mark of Theaetetus whereby reference to Theaetetus is fixed.</p>

<p>
The third proposal about how to understand <em>logos</em> faces the
difficulty that, if it adds anything at all to differentiate knowledge
of <em>O</em> from true belief about <em>O</em>, then what it adds is
a diagnostic quality of <em>O</em>. If there is a problem about how to
identify <em>O</em>, there is a problem about how to identify the
diagnostic quality too. This launches a vicious regress.</p>

<p>
The official conclusion of the <em>Theaetetus</em> is that we still do
not know how to define knowledge. Even on the most sceptical reading,
this is not to say that we have not learned anything about what
knowledge is like. As Theaetetus says (210b6), he has given birth to
far more than he had in him. And as many interpreters have seen, there
may be much more to the ending than that. It may even be that, in the
last two pages of the <em>Theaetetus</em>, we have seen hints of
Plato&rsquo;s own answer to the puzzle. Perhaps <em>understanding</em>
has emerged from the last discussion, as <em>wisdom</em> did from
145d&ndash;e, as the key ingredient without which no true beliefs
alone can even begin to look like they might count as knowledge.
Perhaps it is only when we, the readers, understand this
point&mdash;that epistemological success in the last resort depends on
having epistemological virtue&mdash;that we begin not only to have
true beliefs about what knowledge is, but to understand knowledge. In
any case, although Socrates (210d) advises Theodorus to reconvene the
following morning to continue the discussion, there remains an element
that does not directly concern the aporetic nature of the dialogue.
The final definition of knowledge is, ultimately, true opinion.
Certainly, this definition does not coincide with the
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> being sought (hence, the aporetic nature
of the <em>Theaetetus</em>). Nevertheless, it is undeniable that, from
a certain perspective, this definition is superior to the one that
equated <em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> with mere perception. Knowledge is
not true opinion, yet it must be acknowledged that if
<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em> equates to the direct contact the
disembodied soul has with the Forms, the embodied soul can at best
achieve true opinion (see Maffi 2013, 223&ndash;300). This confirms
that, so to speak, we cannot escape the realm of <em>logoi</em>, and
the highest degree that we, as embodied souls, can reach relative to
absolute knowledge is, in any case, a <em>logos</em>&mdash;true
opinion, which is neither perception nor a lower-level (i.e.,
unfounded) opinion. Perhaps this is the somewhat positive conclusion
Plato reaches in the <em>Theaetetus</em>, suggesting that absolute
knowledge requires a metaphysical framework that even the best and
truest <em>logoi</em> can only approximate. Ultimately, this is the
same reason why our relationship with god (a central theme in the
<em>Theaetetus</em> that is by no means aporetic) can only be one of
resemblance (<em>homoi&ocirc;sis</em>) and not of identification.</p>
