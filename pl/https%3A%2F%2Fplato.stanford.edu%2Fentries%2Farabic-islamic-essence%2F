<h1>Essence and Existence in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Aug 24, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The core issue of Islamic metaphysics is whether the essences of
things are distinct from their existence. The philosophical intuition
underlying the distinction between essence and existence is that
<em>what</em> something is (e.g., human, horse) is different from the
fact <em>that</em> it exists. The debate on the distinction between
essence and existence in Islamic philosophy revolves around the
question whether there is such a distinction to be made at all and, if
so, then whether this distinction is between two features that are
either real (i.e., outside the mind) or only conceptual (i.e., within
the mind). The responses to these questions bear on further
philosophical issues such as divine omnipotence, that is, whether God
can change the essences of things (for instance, turn human into
stone) assuming that God does not create essences but only makes them
existent; and whether God&rsquo;s essence is distinct from God&rsquo;s
existence.</p>

<h2 id="HistOver">1. Historical Overview</h2>

<p>
The discussion of essence and existence in Islamic philosophy extends
throughout its entire history. We can find relevant materials as early
as the ninth century CE and up to the Qajar period of Iranian history
(eighteenth-nineteenth centuries) (Pourjavady 2019). The question
remains crucial in contemporary Islamic philosophy (e.g., Tabatabai
2010). For the purposes of this entry, we will mostly focus on the
period between the ninth and the seventeenth centuries. That period
can be divided into five episodes.</p>

<p>
The first episode takes place within the Islamic tradition of falsafa,
which is the philosophical tradition in the Islamic world rooted in
the Greek-into-Arabic translation movement. Consequently, it is
largely indebted to Greek Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism. The main
protagonists of this episode are Ab&#363; Ya&#703;q&#363;b
al-Kind&#299; (d. after 870 CE) and Ab&#363; Na&#7779;r
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 950&ndash;1 CE).</p>

<p>
The second episode is to be located in another tradition of Islamic
philosophical thought called &ldquo;kal&#257;m&rdquo;. Kal&#257;m
develops largely independently from Greek philosophy as a parallel
philosophical tradition with its own highly original conceptual
framework and a set of philosophical issues. The main schools of
kal&#257;m relevant for this entry are the Mu&#703;tazilites of Basra
as well as the Ash&#703;arites. Classical kal&#257;m reaches its
climactic point of development in the early eleventh century.</p>

<p>
The discussion of essence and existence in early falsafa and classical
kal&#257;m culminates in the third episode: the metaphysics of
Ab&#363; &#703;Al&#299; ibn S&#299;n&#257; (d. 1037 CE), known in the
West under the name of Avicenna. Avicenna develops his own views on
essence and existence in reaction to both falsafa and kal&#257;m. His
innovative analysis of essence and existence sets the framework for
how the question is subsequently addressed in Islamic metaphysics and
beyond.</p>

<p>
The fourth core episode constitutes a reaction to Avicenna&rsquo;s
analysis of essence and existence by the scholars of kal&#257;m, as
well as a refinement of the Avicennan approach essence and existence
in addressing the issues raised by that reaction. The two most
influential contributors to the debate on the relationship between
essence and existence in this period are Fakhr al-D&#299;n
al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. 1210) and Shih&#257;b al-D&#299;n
al-Suhraward&#299; (d. 1191).</p>

<p>
The competition between what can be referred to as the
&ldquo;Raz&#299;an&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Suhraward&#299;an&rdquo;
methods in metaphysics largely shapes subsequent approaches taken to
address the relationship between essence and existence in
post-classical Islamic philosophy. Yet, from the thirteenth century
onwards, another metaphysical trend starts gaining momentum and
influence&mdash;ontological monism. The idea that everything in
reality shares one and the same existence has detrimental consequences
for how Islamic philosophers understand essence and existence.
Originally developed by Ibn &#703;Arab&#299; (d. 1240) and &#7778;adr
al-D&#299;n al-Q&#363;naw&#299; (d. 1274), ontological monism reaches
its culmination in the works of &#7778;adr al-D&#299;n
al-Sh&#299;r&#257;z&#299; (d. 1640), also known as Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257;.</p>

<h2 id="SensBeinFalsBefoAvic">2. Senses of Being in Falsafa Before Avicenna</h2>

<p>
Apparently, there was no one who explicitly accepted the distinction
between essence and existence in the tradition of Islamic falsafa
before Avicenna. For instance, Ab&#363; Ya&#703;q&#363;b al-Kind&#299;
never makes this distinction clear. On the contrary, he states that
&ldquo;being&rdquo; is identical to &ldquo;what something is&rdquo;
(Adamson 2002: 306&ndash;307). In other words, for al-Kind&#299;,
&ldquo;to be&rdquo; means &ldquo;to be something&rdquo;. When we say
that a cup <em>is</em>, we mean that a cup is a cup&mdash;nothing more
and beyond that. Therefore, al-Kind&#299; denies any distinction
between essence and existence.</p>

<p>
In Arabic, al-Kind&#299;&rsquo;s terminology for
&ldquo;existence&rdquo; includes <em>anniyya</em> (on which see Frank
1956), <em>al-ays</em> (on which see Endress 1973: 104&ndash;105), and
<em>huwiyya</em> (on which see Menn 2008: 75). Given the absence of
any distinction between essence and existence in al-Kind&#299;&rsquo;s
metaphysics, all three notions equally designate what something is and
the fact that it is&mdash;something that can be captured with a more
neutral English notion of &ldquo;being&rdquo;. Therefore, when
al-Kind&#299; says that God is pure being (<em>anniyya
faqa&#7789;</em>), he does not mean anything like Avicenna&rsquo;s
later idea that God&rsquo;s essence is confined to the fact that God
exists, unlike the essences of other things which are distinct from
their existence. Rather, al-Kind&#299; engages in the contemporary
kal&#257;m debate on divine attributes. His position that God is
&ldquo;pure being&rdquo; amounts to the statement that God does not
have any attributes that would be really distinct from His essence
(Adamson 2003).</p>

<p>
The later common notion for &ldquo;existence&rdquo; in Arabic
philosophy is <em>wuj&#363;d</em>. It comes from the passive verb form
<em>wujida</em>, and literally means &ldquo;to be found&rdquo;. One
comes across the first extensive discussion of this notion of
existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) and the existent
(<em>mawj&#363;d</em>) in falsafa with Ab&#363; Na&#7779;r
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;.</p>

<p>
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; argues that existence can be understood in
two senses. In the first sense, when we say &ldquo;horses
exist&rdquo;, we mean that horses truly occur outside our minds. In
this sense, existence is a &ldquo;secondary intelligible&rdquo;
(<em>ma&#703;q&#363;l th&#257;n&#299;</em>), as described by
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;. Secondary intelligibles are solely
predicated of further notions in our minds and not of any real objects
(on secondary intelligibles in Islamic philosophy, see Sabra 1980).
For instance, &ldquo;cup&rdquo; is a primary notion in our minds. It
corresponds to a cup outside the mind. But when we say that cups
exist, we just mean that what we conceive under the notion of
&ldquo;cup&rdquo; has instantiations in the extramental world. We
attribute the predicate of existence understood in the sense of having
an instantiation outside the mind to the notion of cup in the mind,
not to the real cup outside the mind. We can apply the notion of
existence in the same way to any notions we wish. When we say that
aliens, for instance, do not exist, we mean that whatever we think of
when we think of aliens has no instantiation outside the mind.</p>

<p>
Therefore, although al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; never explicitly stresses
it, the first sense of existence implies that existence must at least
have a different meaning (that is, be conceptually distinct) from our
notions corresponding to the essences of things. &ldquo;Cups&rdquo;
and &ldquo;humans&rdquo; obviously mean different things, but whether
we say that cups exist or that humans exist, we always have the same
notion in mind: that something has at least one instantiation outside
the mind (Menn 2008).</p>

<p>
And yet, al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; refrains from postulating any
clear-cut distinction between the essences of things and their
existence. His resistance to a metaphysical distinction between what
things are and their existence is evident in
al-Far&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s discussion of the second sense of
existence. Here, al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; states that existence
amounts to possessing a certain essence outside our minds. In this
sense, he asserts that existence relates to real objects and is
identical to them. For a cup, &ldquo;to be&rdquo; still means to be a
cup, insofar as by &ldquo;being&rdquo; we refer to an ontological
reality that pertains to cups outside our minds. (Menn 2008).</p>

<h2 id="ThinTheiExisClasKala">3. Things and Their Existence in Classical Kal&#257;m</h2>

<p>
In classical kal&#257;m, there are two theories that problematize the
relationship between things and the fact of their ontological presence
in the world. One of these theories proposes that objects
(<em>dhaw&#257;t</em>) have some ontological status of their own,
beyond their existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>).</p>

<p>
Several representatives of the Basran tradition of the
Mu&#703;tazilite school of kal&#257;m argue that things, before their
creation by God, already are what they are. God&rsquo;s sole task in
creation consists of attaching existence to some already semi-real
objects. He looks at them and says to them &ldquo;Be!&rdquo; (cf.
Qur&#703;&#257;n 36:82), but He cannot change what they are. This
doctrine is commonly epitomized with the slogan &ldquo;the
non-existent is a thing&rdquo; (<em>al-ma&#703;d&#363;m
shay&#702;</em>). Another way to put the same doctrine is to say that
the reality (<em>thub&#363;t</em>) of things is extensionally broader
that their existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) as it includes non-existent
things as well (Frank 1980; Klein-Franke 1994).</p>

<p>
A modern reader may find multiple striking parallels between the
Basran Mu&#703;tazilite theory of non-existent objects and the
metaphysics of Meinongianism. For instance, the Basran
Mu&#703;tazilites equally use theories of intentionality to establish
the reality of things beyond existence. They argue that divine and
human wishes and thoughts must have some sort of connection or
association (<em>ta&#703;alluq</em>) with their objects. Yet, a
connection or an association is possible only if there is something to
which the wishes and thoughts may be connected. Therefore, we need to
postulate a separate realm of reality that contains all our objects of
thought and volitions even before they exist (Benevich 2018b).</p>

<p>
Although the theory of non-existent objects did not explicitly include
the notion of essences, it posited a real distinction between objects
(<em>dhaw&#257;t</em>) and their thing-ness (<em>shay&#702;iyya</em>)
on the one hand and their existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) on the
other. Things are already things even before they are made existent.
Hence, what things are must be different from the fact that they exist
(Wisnovsky 2000).</p>

<p>
The second relevant theory addresses the relationship between things
and their existence even more directly. The Basran Mu&#703;tazilites
argue that being existent (<em>mawj&#363;d</em>) is a state
(<em>&#7717;&#257;l</em>) that belongs to objects in the world
extrinsically.</p>

<p>
The ontology of kal&#257;m traditionally includes two main types of
entities, substantial elements (<em>jaw&#257;hir</em>, traditionally
translated as &ldquo;atoms&rdquo;) and their accidents
(<em>a&#703;r&#257;&#7693;</em>). Substantial elements are responsible
for the physical structure of the universe, the constitution of bodies
and their spatial location. Accidents are entities
(<em>ma&#703;&#257;n&#299;</em>) that inhere in the substantial
elements and the bodies that they form and stand for all other
perceptible and sometimes non-perceptible qualities (Dhanani 1994;
Frank 1978).</p>

<p>
The front figure of Basran Mu&#703;tazilism, Ab&#363; H&#257;shim
al-Jubb&#257;&#702;&#299; (d. 933), suggests that there is something
beyond the substantial elements and the accidents&mdash;something he
calls &ldquo;states&rdquo; (<em>a&#7717;w&#257;l</em>). The states are
non-perceptible, non-entitative features that belong to the
substantial elements or the bodies they form together. The Basran
Mu&#703;tazilites usually express the non-entitative character of the
states by stating that they are neither existent nor non-existent
(<em>ghayr ma&#703;d&#363;m wa-ghayr mawj&#363;d</em>). Despite how it
may appear, this statement does not violate the principle of the
excluded middle; it merely implies that the application of existence
and non-existence to the states constitutes a category mistake.
Another way the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites emphasize the non-entitative
status of the states is by arguing that they cannot be known on their
own. Whenever we think of a state, we conceive of it as belonging to
something, not as a separate entity (Frank 1971 and 1978; Thiele 2016;
Benevich 2016; Zamboni 2023).</p>

<p>
Among these non-entitative states, the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites
distinguish many types, but we may simply focus on two. Firstly, some
states are grounded in the accidents that inhere in the bodies. For
instance, the accident of desire (<em>shahwa</em>) inheres somewhere
around the heart and gives rise to a state of desiring (<em>kawn
mushtahiyan</em>) attributed to the entire human (<em>jumla</em>).
Note that accidents are usually perceptible by senses but those
accidents that give rise to the states are non-perceptible; we cannot
perceive desire (Ibn Mattawayh, <em>Tadhkira</em>, 415). The second
group of accidents is usually described as ungrounded or uncaused.
They belong to things intrinsically. For instance, the feature of
occupying space (<em>kawn muta&#7717;ayyizan</em>) belongs to
substantial elements in virtue of themselves (Frank 1978; Thiele
2016).</p>

<p>
Now, for the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites, being existent (<em>kawn
mawj&#363;dan</em>) is considered as a state that belongs to things.
Like any other state, being existent is distinct
(<em>z&#257;&#702;id</em>, literally &ldquo;additional&rdquo;) from
the substantial elements and their accidents themselves, but is not an
entity by itself. More specifically, the state of being existent is
somewhere between the two aforementioned groups of states. On the one
hand, being existent is a state that belongs to things extrinsically.
As discussed earlier, God makes things exist. On the other hand,
however, the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites deny that being existent is
grounded in any kind of accident, such as an entity
(<em>ma&#703;n&#257;</em>) of existence inherent in existent things.
Thus, through their theory of states, the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites
clearly acknowledge that being existent is something distinct from
what things are, but they are reluctant to postulate any distinct
entity of existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) that belongs to things
extrinsically (Zamboni 2023).</p>

<p>
There are many different reactions to the Basran Mu&#703;tazilite
metaphysics of non-existent objects and states even within the
Mu&#703;tazilite school. However, both modern and medieval scholars
typically oppose it to the metaphysics of the Ash&#703;arite tradition
of kal&#257;m. According to the Ash&#703;arites, things have no
metaphysical status before God creates them; they are fully dependent
on God both in terms of what they are and that they exist. The
Ash&#703;arites deny any extensional difference between the reality of
things and their existence, asserting that only existent things are
real. In response to the Basran discussion of intentionality, the
Ash&#703;arites argue that we conceive of non-existent things
&ldquo;on the supposition of their existence (<em>&#703;al&#257;
taqd&#299;r al-wuj&#363;d</em>)&rdquo;, although it is not entirely
clear what they mean by that (Frank 2000).</p>

<p>
Going beyond that, the Ash&#703;arites clearly deny that being
existent is something distinct from what things are in themselves.
Even those among the Ash&#703;arites who partially accept the theory
of states (<em>a&#7717;w&#257;l</em>), such as Ab&#363;
al-Ma&#703;&#257;l&#299; al-Juwayn&#299; (d. 1085), categorically deny
that being existent is such a state. In response to the common
argument, typically used to support the reality of a state, which
posits an obvious similarity between the notions of existence in the
sentences &ldquo;Human beings exist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cups
exist&rdquo;, the Ash&#703;arites argue that the similarity is merely
verbal (<em>laf&#7827;&#299;</em>) and has no correspondence in the
real world (Benevich 2018c; for more on Ash&#703;arite ontology, see
Frank 1999 and Frank 2004). Thus, for the Ash&#703;arites there is no
distinction between the essence of things and their existence
whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="AvicEsseExis">4. Avicenna on Essence and Existence</h2>

<p>
Despite the presence of an extensive discussion of the relationship
between things and their existence in classical kal&#257;m, the main
historiographical reason for why contemporary scholarship regards the
issue of essence and existence among the main contributions of Islamic
philosophy to the history of philosophy, without any doubt, is
Avicenna&rsquo;s analysis of essence and existence and its impact on
the later tradition.</p>

<p>
Avicenna made the distinction between essence, quiddity, or the
reality and nature of something (his Arabic notions for these are
<em>dh&#257;t</em>, <em>m&#257;hiyya</em>, <em>&#7717;aq&#299;qa</em>,
and <em>&#7789;ab&#299;&#703;a</em>; see Goichon 1937: 30&ndash;32),
on the one hand, and its existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>), on the other
hand, the central feature of his metaphysics. His main argument in
favor of the distinction between essence and existence is that we can
know what things are (human beings, horses, triangles) without knowing
whether they exist. This argument relies on a conceptual test that is
highly characteristic of Avicenna&rsquo;s type of essentialism
(Benevich 2018a and 2022). Simply stated, Avicenna&rsquo;s conceptual
test posits that if <em>x</em> is essential for <em>y</em>, then we
cannot conceive of <em>x</em> without conceiving of y. Conversely, if
we can conceive of <em>x</em> without <em>y</em>, <em>y</em> is not
essential for <em>x</em>; <em>y</em> is distinct from <em>x</em> and
extrinsic to it. Thus, insofar as we can conceive of things without
knowing whether they exist or not, their existence is distinct from
their essence (Avicenna, <em>Remarks and Admonitions</em>, 121).</p>

<p>
Avicenna extensively argues against the position of early falsafa and
the Ash&#703;arite scholars of kal&#257;m that &ldquo;to be&rdquo;
means &ldquo;to be something&rdquo;. He labels this position as
stating the equivocity of existence (<em>al-ishtir&#257;k
al-laf&#7827;&#299;</em>). Philosophers who accept the equivocity of
existence believe that, in each case, &ldquo;to exist&rdquo; means
something different. For a horse, to exist means to exist as a horse;
for Socrates, to exist means to exist as Socrates. Avicenna denies the
equivocity of existence. He employs an argument similar to the
conceptual test we have just seen above: If &ldquo;to be&rdquo; or
&ldquo;to exist&rdquo; had the same meaning as &ldquo;to be
something&rdquo;, then saying that horses exist would be semantically
tantamount to saying that horses are horses. This is not true.
Therefore, &ldquo;to exist&rdquo; cannot be identical to being
something, that is, to having a certain essence ([HA], 3: T3).</p>

<p>
In both of these arguments, we can observe how Avicenna transitions
from a conceptual level of analysis to conclusions about reality. The
presence of a conceptual distinction between two meanings (essence and
existence) leads Avicenna to the conclusion that there is a real
distinction. However, interpreting Avicenna&rsquo;s distinction
between essence and existence as a real distinction should not lead us
to think that he accepts that essences have or could have some kind of
ontological status beyond being existent. Avicenna may derive a real
distinction between essence and existence from the analysis of the
corresponding meanings, but he never establishes an
<em>extensional</em> distinction between the two.</p>

<p>
Indeed, despite disagreeing with the Ash&#703;arites on the meaning of
existence and &ldquo;being something&rdquo; (<em>shay&#702;iyya</em>),
Avicenna agrees with them that things are what they are if and only if
they exist (Wisnovsky 2000; Druart 2001). Thus, Avicenna is not ready
to concur with the Basran Mu&#703;tazilites that essences already
exist in a certain manner even before God brings them into existence.
He argues that nothing can have any kind of reality without being
existent.</p>

<p>
In the previous section, we observed that the Mu&#703;tazilites argued
that non-existent things are real because we can have an intentional
relation to them. However, for Avicenna, intentionality is primarily
directed towards mental beings rather than anything outside the mind.
When I think of a phoenix, for instance, the intentional object of my
thought is a phoenix in my mind, not a phoenix outside my mind
(Zarepour forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Avicenna&rsquo;s philosophy of mind is in agreement with his logical
analysis. According to Avicenna, every affirmative proposition of the
form &ldquo;<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>&rdquo; has existential import.
This is because <em>P</em>, as an affirmative predicate, carries
existential significance (<em>wuj&#363;d&#299;</em>). For Avicenna,
affirmative predication literally means that a predicate exists
<em>in</em> the subject. Therefore, Avicenna argues, the subject must
also be something existent, as a predicate cannot exist in nothing.
Consequently, every affirmative predication implies an existent
subject. Now, non-existent things do not exist outside the mind;
therefore, they must exist inside the mind. As Avicenna puts it,
affirmative predication implies that the predicate exists at least
inside the mind (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>, <em>Metaphysics</em>
1.5).</p>

<p>
Thus, whenever we think of an essence or predicate something of an
essence, we are attributing something to an existent object. If that
essence does not exist in the extramental reality, it exists within
the mind. This represents another crucial innovation in
Avicenna&rsquo;s metaphysics, namely, a doctrine of mental existence
(<em>wuj&#363;d dhihn&#299;</em>). Just as the essences of things can
be instantiated outside the mind, they can also exist within our minds
whenever we conceive of them (Black 1997 and 1999). The doctrine of
mental existence helps Avicenna maintain the extensional identity
between essence and existence, in agreement with the Ash&#703;arite
approach.</p>

<p>
That said, there are a few elements in Avicenna&rsquo;s conception of
the relationship between essence and existence that strongly resemble
Basran Mu&#703;tazilite views. For instance, despite stating that the
essence of things must exist either inside or outside the mind,
Avicenna also accepts that there is a way of considering essences in
themselves with no regard to their existence whatsoever. If we take
horseness qua horseness, for example, it has no relation to whether it
exists in our minds as a universal, outside our minds as something
particular, or does not exist at all (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>,
<em>Metaphysics</em> 5.1). This theory is sometimes referred to as
Avicenna&rsquo;s doctrine of <em>pure quiddity</em> or the theory of
<em>neutrality of essence towards existence</em>. In the later
tradition, it has become known as the doctrine of <em>common
nature</em> (<em>natura communis</em> in Latin and <em>kull&#299;
&#7789;ab&#299;&#703;&#299;</em> in Arabic). The doctrine of pure
quiddity pushes the Avicennan understanding of essences towards
Mu&#703;tazilite Meinongianism and some kind of third-realm ontology,
at least according to some commentators. For these commentators,
Avicenna accepts a doctrine of the priority of essence over mental and
concrete existence (note, however, that not all commentators agree
that the priority in question, which they accept, translates into a
third-realm). In this context, Avicenna&rsquo;s theory of pure
quiddity is often compared with a later medieval doctrine of <em>esse
essentiae</em> (see further De Libera 1996 and 1999; Porro 2002; Janos
2020).</p>

<p>
Other commentators understand the status of pure quiddity in Avicenna
differently. They emphasize that whenever Avicenna talks about pure
quiddity or the ontological status of pure quiddity, which he calls
&ldquo;divine existence&rdquo; (<em>wuj&#363;d il&#257;h&#299;</em>),
he means that pure quiddities are immanent in their instantiations
(Benevich 2015; Avicenna inherits the notion from Ya&#7717;y&#257; ibn
&#703;Ad&#299;; see further Rashed 2004). Indeed, Avicenna does not
shy away from simplistic mereological language when describing the
relationship between an essence and its instantiation. The essence is
a part of the whole individual, he says (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>,
<em>Metaphysics</em> 5.1). Parts clearly have some kind of priority
over the whole, as you need the parts for the existence of the
whole&mdash;another argument in favor of ascribing the doctrine of the
priority of essence to Avicenna (cf. Menn 2013: 156). However, one
could reply that if an essence, as a part of the whole individual,
were ontologically prior to the individual, then it would be
completely independent of it. For instance, one could imagine a
possible world in which the pure essence of horseness that belongs to
Bucephalus belonged to Marengo (Napoleon&rsquo;s horse). This would
violate the necessary identity between Bucephalus and its essence,
which Avicenna definitely accepts as a consequence of his <em>de
re</em> essentialism (Benevich 2022). Therefore, the pure essence of
horseness that belongs to Bucephalus exists only insofar as it is
instantiated in Bucephalus. Thus, Bucephalus&rsquo;s pure horseness
cannot be simply ontologically prior to Bucephalus itself. A more
accurate way of expressing Avicenna&rsquo;s doctrine of pure quiddity
may be to say that pure quiddities, such as horseness qua horseness,
have essential (amounting to definitional or logical) priority over
their instantiations, but they are not ontologically prior to them. On
this interpretation, Avicenna does not accept anything similar to the
Mu&#703;tazilite third-realm ontology or the later Latin <em>esse
essentiae</em> (Druart 2001; McGinnis 2007; Bertolacci 2012; Lizzini,
2014; Benevich 2019).</p>

<p>
Whether Avicenna&rsquo;s pure quiddities push him in the
Mu&#703;tazilite-Meinongian direction or not, we can observe that he
definitely agrees with the Mu&#703;tazilites on another
issue&mdash;that things are what they are independently of God.
According to Avicenna, God has no effect on essences. Taking the
example of the number four, Avicenna argues that if there were someone
who made four, for instance, an even number, then we could imagine a
possible world in which that someone would be absent, and the number
four would not be even. This scenario, however, contradicts the truth
of the proposition &ldquo;Necessarily, four is an even number&rdquo;,
implying that four is an even number in all possible worlds.
Therefore, God has no influence on whether four is even or not; four
is essentially an even number, independently of God ([HA], 4: T6).</p>

<p>
Avicenna very clearly distinguishes between the causes of an essence
qua essence and the causes of its existence (Avicenna, <em>Remarks and
Admonitions</em>, 121). Consequently, the only influence that God has
is to bring essences into existence. This division of labor is, in
fact, the most crucial metaphysical consequence of Avicenna&rsquo;s
distinction between essence and existence. Since essences are distinct
from their existence, Avicenna easily problematizes the modalities of
the relationship between the two. According to Avicenna, all things
either necessarily exist by virtue of themselves (their essence) or
contingently exist by virtue of themselves and necessarily exist
through another. The latter category encompasses all things apart from
God and possesses a curious modal status&mdash;it is simultaneously
necessary and contingent, viewed from two different perspectives. For
instance, if you isolate the essence of Bucephalus, nothing about it
implies that it exists. However, if you consider the essence of
Bucephalus as part of the global picture&mdash;that is, with all
causes leading to the existence of Bucephalus, ultimately tracing back
to God&mdash;then the existence of Bucephalus becomes necessary.
Avicenna, a necessitarian, accepts that everything that exists does so
necessarily. In his terms, existence is a necessary concomitant
(<em>l&#257;zim</em>) of essences (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>,
<em>Metaphysics</em> 1.5). This implies that existence, though
distinct from and extrinsic to essence, is still a necessary attribute
of essence. Avicenna acknowledges that once there is an essence, it
exists necessarily, even if existence is not essential to it
(Richardson 2014; Morvarid manuscript; Kaukua forthcoming).</p>

<p>
The only case in Avicenna&rsquo;s metaphysics where something exists
through itself is God, the Necessary Existent in Itself
(<em>w&#257;jib al-wuj&#363;d bi-dh&#257;tihi</em>). The Necessary
Existent is also the only instance in which essence and existence are
identical, as God&rsquo;s essence confines itself to being existent
(Bertolacci 2012; Mayer 2003; Adamson 2013a; Zarepour 2022). Avicenna
argues that if God&rsquo;s essence were distinct from His existence,
it would imply that it causes its own existence (all other options
would fail to account for God&rsquo;s unique status as the Necessary
Existent). However, Avicenna argues, nothing can be such that it
causes its own existence. For something to be a cause, it needs to
already exist. In God&rsquo;s case, it would mean that God&rsquo;s
essence already exists before causing its own existence (Avicenna,
<em>Remarks and Admonitions</em>, 125). Clearly, this is absurd, or,
even worse, it introduces a danger of infinite regress as we can start
asking what caused that second-order existence that God&rsquo;s
essence had before causing its own existence&mdash;and so on ad
infinitum. Thus, within the context of the discussion of God&rsquo;s
essence, Avicenna clearly denies the priority of essence over
existence, even if it is just the causal priority that he discusses
here.</p>

<p>
If God&rsquo;s essence is pure existence, then how is the existence of
Bucephalus, for example, not identical with God? We cannot introduce
any qualitative distinction between God&rsquo;s existence and the
existence of Bucephalus to explain the numerical distinction between
them because the presence of any additional qualities in God&rsquo;s
existence would violate its simplicity. This violation, in turn, would
compromise its unique and necessary status (Mayer 2003). To solve this
problem, Avicenna introduces one last twist to his doctrine of essence
and existence: the doctrine of the modulation or analogy of existence
(<em>tashk&#299;k al-wuj&#363;d</em>). This doctrine derives
historically from the Aristotelian <em>pros hen</em> predication,
which Avicenna understands as something falling in between purely
equivocal and univocal predication (Treiger 2012). Thus, according to
Avicenna, existence is neither an equivocal notion, as we saw above,
nor an entirely univocal one. Different types of existence vary in
accordance with the ontological status of the things that exist
(Druart 2014; De Haan 2015; Janos 2020, 2022a, 2022b; Zamboni 2020).
For instance, the existence of substances differs from the existence
of accidents. In the same vein, the existence of God differs from the
existence of Bucephalus&mdash;not qualitatively, but by way of
modulation or analogy. Avicenna&rsquo;s analogy of existence shows
that he, despite accepting a strict distinction between essence and
existence, still sees a close link between the essence of a thing and
the type of existence that it has.</p>

<h2 id="RealConcAfteAvic">5. Realism and Conceptualism After Avicenna</h2>

<p>
One of the striking features of Avicenna&rsquo;s theory of essence and
existence is his assumption that the difference in meaning between
essence and existence leads to a distinction in reality. We have seen
in the previous section that both of Avicenna&rsquo;s main arguments
in favor of the distinction between essence and existence are based on
the conceptual difference between what something is and the fact that
it is. Avicenna does not present a clear-cut argument in favor of a
real distinction between essence and existence. The majority of
post-Avicennan philosophers notice this issue with Avicenna&rsquo;s
theory. Consequently, they often accept the conceptual distinction
between essence and existence but reject the idea that what things are
is different from the fact that they are in extramental reality
(Wisnovsky 2011; Eichner 2011; Benevich 2017; Zamboni 2023).</p>

<p>
The reasons for denying any real distinction between essence and
existence revolve around the issues that arise when considering both
the essence of something and its existence as two real entities
outside the mind&mdash;something akin to two pieces of Lego that are
joined together when something comes into being. As innocent as this
picture may seem, it implies salient metaphysical issues regarding the
ontological status of these two pieces of Lego when analyzed
separately. Take, for instance, the essence in isolation from its
existence. What is the status of this essence? We cannot say that it
does not exist yet because that would imply that existence as an
attribute is attached to something non-existent. However, if we say
that the essence exists, then we ascribe some kind of second-order
existence to the essence before it exists. This is absurd in itself
and leads to an infinite regress, as we can continue inquiring about
the ontological status of the essence taken in isolation from the
second-order existence, and so on ad infinitum. Avicenna addressed a
similar priority problem in his discussion of whether God&rsquo;s
essence is distinct from its existence, as we saw in the previous
section. Now, the same issue is applied to contingent beings as well.
This argument against the real distinction between essence and
existence can be found, for instance, in the treatises of &#703;Umar
al-Khayy&#257;m (d. 1123&ndash;24) and Ath&#299;r al-D&#299;n
al-Abhar&#299; (d. 1264) ([HA], 2: T11, T45).</p>

<p>
Another way to encounter a similar issue with the infinite regress is
to focus on the side of existence, taken in isolation from the essence
to which it belongs. If existence is genuinely distinct in the
extramental world, should we not say that existence exists
itself&mdash;just like anything else in the world? However, accepting
that existence exists implies that it has a second-order existence.
This leads to an infinite regress, as we can pose the same question
regarding the second-order existence&mdash;and so on ad infinitum.
Al-Khayy&#257;m, once again, stands among the post-Avicennan
philosophers proposing this argument ([HA], 2: T8).</p>

<p>
Another, similar argument involves applying the logic of
Avicenna&rsquo;s argument from conceivability to existence itself. If
existence is something distinct from essence, then, just as we could
conceive of the essence of a triangle while doubting that it exists,
we could also conceive of the essence of existence itself while
doubting that it exists. Hence, we could argue that, insofar as we can
conceive of the essence of existence without some kind of second-order
existence belonging to it, there is a real distinction between
existence itself and the second-order existence that belongs to it.
Consequently, we would apply the same conceivability test to the
second-order existence&mdash;and so on ad infinitum. The most famous
proponent of this argument is also the most famous opponent of the
distinction between essence and existence in post-Avicennan
philosophy, the aforementioned Shih&#257;b al-D&#299;n
al-Suhraward&#299; ([HA], 2: T38&ndash;T40).</p>

<p>
As a result of these arguments, the majority of post-Avicennan
philosophers reject that Avicenna&rsquo;s conceptual test implies any
real distinction between essence and existence or that there is such a
distinction in the first place. I will refer to these philosophers as
the &ldquo;conceptualists&rdquo;. For the conceptualists, there is no
such thing as existence outside the mind. Rather, the conceptualists
argue that &ldquo;to exist&rdquo; means to &ldquo;be
instantiated&rdquo; and is applied to concepts in our minds when we,
for instance, say that the notion of a horse has real correspondents
in the world (e.g., al-Khayy&#257;m in [HA], 2: T9).</p>

<p>
For the conceptualists, existence as such is not anything real in the
world; there are only the objects themselves. In a move that can be
interpreted as a return to al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s first
sense of existence, al-Suhraward&#299; argues that existence is a
&ldquo;secondary intelligible&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a notion that can
be applied only to other notions in the mind, those that are called
&ldquo;primary intelligibles&rdquo;. Only primary intelligibles, such
as the notion of &ldquo;white&rdquo;, refer to real entities outside
the mind. Secondary intelligibles, such as &ldquo;existence&rdquo;,
fail to refer to anything extramentally real. One may ask how this
does not violate the truth conditions of their predication.
Al-Suhraward&#299; replies that when we say, for instance, that
Socrates is an individual, we say something that is true, but there is
no such thing as &ldquo;individuality&rdquo; outside the mind ([HA],
2: T36). For al-Suhraward&#299;, in some sense, all conceptual
considerations (<em>i&#703;tib&#257;r&#257;t dhiniyya</em>), including
existence, are epistemically grounded in reality despite not having
any distinct reality outside the mind (Kaukua 2020). Thus, the
conceptualists conclude that, despite meaning two different things,
essence and existence refer to one and the same concrete being
(<em>huwiyya</em>)&mdash;another notion that they draw from the
tradition of early falsafa but give it a new meaning ([HA], 2: T37,
T46).</p>

<p>
There are few post-Avicennan philosophers who appear to resist these
conceptualist tendencies and remain faithful to Avicenna&rsquo;s real
distinction between essence and existence (henceforth called
&ldquo;realists&rdquo;). The realists employ several strategies to
resist the arguments of the conceptualists. For instance, on the side
of existence, they attempt to avoid the infinite regress by
differentiating between two types of predication. One type of
predication implies attribution. We say that, for instance, an apple
is red because the attribute of redness belongs to it. However, when
we look at redness itself, we can also say that it is red, yet not in
virtue of any further redness that belongs to it. Similarly, when we
say that something exists, we attribute existence to it. However, when
we say that existence exists (something Avicenna himself would
probably simply deem unintelligible), we do not need to attribute any
further, second-order existence to existence. Existence exists through
itself ([HA], 2: T12, T14).</p>

<p>
A potentially more convincing solution on behalf of the realist is a
partial abandoning of the reality of existence outside the mind. The
core idea in this context is something that may be referred to as the
&ldquo;non-entitativity of existence&rdquo;. The non-entitativity of
existence means that existence is not an attribute or an accident that
resides in essence in the same way as redness is an accident that
resides in an apple. Existence is not an entity as such. Rather,
existence is being existent (<em>mawj&#363;diyya</em>), the
realization (<em>ta&#7717;aqquq</em>), or the occurrence
(<em>&#7717;us&#363;l</em>) of entities. Therefore, we do not need to
attribute any further existence to existence since it is not an entity
in the first place. This solution can be attributed to
Avicenna&rsquo;s own disciple Bahmany&#257;r (d. 1044) as well as to
the most influential proponent of the real distinction between essence
and existence after Avicenna, Fakhr al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299;
([HA], 2: T5, T27). In many ways, this solution is reminiscent of the
classical Basran Mu&#703;tazilite position, which regards being
existent as a state (<em>&#7717;&#257;l</em>) that is distinct from
what objects are in themselves and yet has no grounding attribute of
existence behind it (Zamboni 2023).</p>

<p>
Still, Fakhr al-D&#299;n&rsquo;s most influential contribution to the
defense of the real distinction between essence and existence concerns
the side of essence, not the side of existence. In response to the
priority issues outlined above, Fakhr al-D&#299;n most decisively
bites the bullet and accepts that essences are prior to their
existence. He refuses, however, to accept that the priority of
essences over existence pushes him to affirm that they either exist or
do not exist before existence attaches to them (with both options
leading to problems we observed above). For Fakhr al-D&#299;n,
applying either existence or non-existence to the essences considered
in themselves is a category mistake. Essences are prior to their
existence in themselves (<em>f&#299; anfusihim</em>) and insofar as
they are essences (<em>min &#7717;aythu hiya hiya</em>)&mdash;not
insofar as they have some kind of ontological status ([HA], 2:
T22&ndash;24). What Fakhr al-D&#299;n probably means by this is some
kind of essential (or definitional) priority of essences over their
individual instantiations, without any ontological priority implied.
This solution is akin to what we saw Avicenna suggested himself in the
previous section (at least according to some commentators). It is also
closely connected to Avicenna&rsquo;s own statement that applying the
notions of numerical identify and non-identity to essences taken in
themselves is a category mistake (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>,
<em>Metaphysics</em>, 5.1).</p>

<p>
Fakhr al-D&#299;n is very consistent about his acceptance of the
priority of essence over existence. For instance, he applies this
principle to rule out one exception from the distinction between
essence and existence that Avicenna himself was ready to make: the
case of God&rsquo;s essence. Avicenna suggested that God&rsquo;s
essence cannot be distinct from God&rsquo;s existence because to cause
its own existence, it would need to be prior to it. However, Fakhr
al-D&#299;n is more than happy to accept that God&rsquo;s essence is
prior to God&rsquo;s existence&mdash;just as the essence of anything
else is prior to its own existence. God&rsquo;s case is unique because
God&rsquo;s essence causes its own existence, unlike in the case of
everything else when essences merely receive existence from external
causes ([HA], 9: T29).</p>

<p>
For Fakhr al-D&#299;n, there is no difference between God and
contingent beings in terms of existence. Fakhr al-D&#299;n, in fact,
is a very consistent defender of the position of the univocity of
existence. &ldquo;Existence&rdquo; refers to one and the same
phenomenon of ontological presence in all cases, including God. What
is different are essences, not existence.</p>

<p>
That said, Fakhr al-D&#299;n&rsquo;s approach to God&rsquo;s essence
and existence remains a minority view in the first two centuries after
Avicenna&rsquo;s death. The majority of post-Avicennan philosophers
accept Avicenna&rsquo;s explanation of God&rsquo;s existence based on
the notion of the analogy or modulation of existence (<em>tashk&#299;k
al-wuj&#363;d</em>). This is mostly due to the influence of
al-Suhraward&#299;, who develops a philosophical idea that things can
be numerically distinct while they have all the same qualities, merely
because they have those qualities to a different extent or grade. This
way, the post-Avicennan proponents of the Avicennan view that
God&rsquo;s essence is pure existence manage to sustain a numerical
distinction between God&rsquo;s existence and the existence of
contingent beings within the universe without violating the principle
of the identity of indiscernibles (Benevich 2020a and 2020b).</p>

<p>
The doctrine of the analogy or modulation of existence helps the
conceptualists solve one important issue that arises from accepting
Avicenna&rsquo;s view that God&rsquo;s essence is existence. If
conceptualism is correct, existence is a secondary intelligible, and
there is no such thing as existence outside our minds, then how can
Avicenna be right in saying that God is existence? In response, most
conceptualists are willing to make an exception for God. For them, God
is the only real instantiation of existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>)
outside the mind.</p>

<p>
At least since Na&#7779;&#299;r al-D&#299;n al-&#7788;&#363;s&#299;
(d. 1274), Islamic philosophers distinguish between two different ways
of analyzing existence. On the one hand, we can take existence in the
absolute sense (<em>wuj&#363;d mu&#7789;laq</em>), meaning any kind of
ontological presence in the world. In this sense, all things partake
in existence; they all exist in some sense. This notion of existence
merely designates a concept in our minds. Existence, taken in the
absolute sense, is merely a conceptual consideration
(<em>i&#703;tib&#257;r dhihn&#299;</em>) or a secondary intention
(<em>ma&#703;q&#363;l th&#257;n&#299;</em>)&mdash;whether applied to
God or to a cup on the table. When we say that something
exists&mdash;God or a cup&mdash;we mean that a primary notion (God or
a cup) has an instantiation.</p>

<p>
However, we can also look at existence as a modulated term
(<em>bi-l-tashk&#299;k</em>). In this sense, existence applies to
different things differently. God is the paradigm case of existence,
while everything else receives existence in gradation. Now, it is that
modulated kind of existence that constitutes the divine essence.
God&rsquo;s special kind of existence is God&rsquo;s essence
(<em>wuj&#363;d kh&#257;&#7779;&#7779;</em>)&mdash;a notion Avicenna
himself used to designate essence (Avicenna, <em>Healing</em>,
<em>Metaphysics</em>, 1.5). In fact, even for all other things,
modulated existence appears to be identical with their essences,
albeit probably not in the same sense as for God ([HA], 9: T56; see
further Pourjavady 2011 and 2017 on the various interpretations of
this move in the Safavid period of Islamic philosophy).</p>

<h2 id="PrimEsseVsPrimExisLateIslaMeta">6. Primacy of Essence vs. Primacy of Existence in Later Islamic Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
As we observed in the previous section, considering essence and
existence as two pieces of Lego that need to be brought together in
the process of creation for anything to come into being leads to
issues regarding the ontological status of either piece of Lego in
isolation from the other. The core tendency behind the predominance of
conceptualism in the first two centuries of post-Avicennan philosophy
is an attempt to solve those issues by doing away with the notion of
existence outside the mind, one way or another. For the
conceptualists, the only entities outside the mind are the essences of
things. Existence merely is a conceptual consideration
(<em>i&#703;tib&#257;r dhihn&#299;</em>) or a secondary intention
(<em>ma&#703;q&#363;l th&#257;n&#299;</em>). No existence, no
problems.</p>

<p>
However, starting from the thirteenth century, we can observe the
emergence and development of an opposite tendency. This tendency,
instead of doing away with existence, does away with the essences of
things. The most famous representative of this approach to essence and
existence is a later philosopher, &#7778;adr al-D&#299;n
al-Sh&#299;r&#257;z&#299;, better known as Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257;. He believes that the essences of things are sheer
conceptual considerations of our minds. In reality, there is existence
alone. When we look at the world, we distinguish between
&ldquo;human&rdquo; and &ldquo;horse&rdquo;. In reality, however, the
world is a continuous flow of unified existence. &ldquo;Humans&rdquo;
and &ldquo;horses&rdquo; are just the way the world appears to us. In
reality, again, there are no distinct humans and horses, only unified
existence. Based on the aforementioned doctrine of the analogy of
existence (<em>tashk&#299;k al-wuj&#363;d</em>), Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257; argues that, if anything at all, we can distinguish
between different gradations of existence in reality, but not between
different essences (Rahman 1975; Rizvi 2003 and 2009; Kalin 2010).</p>

<p>
The Sadrian existence-based ontological monism is a position radically
opposed to the conceptualism of the earlier post-Avicennan
philosophers, such as al-Suhraward&#299;. For al-Suhraward&#299;, it
is existence that is just a notion which we use to account for real
things; essences are real. For &#7778;adr&#257;, it is the other way
round. The radical split between these two tendencies in approaching
essence and existence in post-Avicennan Islamic philosophy is usually
referred to as the debate between those who accept the primacy of
essence (<em>a&#7779;&#257;lat al-m&#257;hiyya</em>), such as
al-Suhraward&#299;, and those who accept the primacy of existence
(<em>a&#7779;&#257;lat al-wuj&#363;d</em>), such as Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257;.</p>

<p>
The implications of the split between the doctrine of the primacy of
essence and the primacy of existence can be best explained if we look
back at the old question of whether God creates essences. In the
previous sections, we have seen the Basran Mu&#703;tazilite position
stating that things are what they are independently of God. We have
also seen Avicenna accepting the doctrine of essential
independence&mdash;the idea that essences are necessarily what they
are independently of God. For Avicenna, God&rsquo;s task was to make
essences exist, not to make them essences.</p>

<p>
In the post-Avicennan tradition, Avicenna&rsquo;s view was quickly
associated with the Mu&#703;tazilites, and both doctrines were
rejected altogether. One of Avicenna&rsquo;s core arguments, as
observed above, was that if someone made four an even number, in the
absence of that someone, it would be possible that four is not an even
number. Sa&#703;ad al-D&#299;n al-Taftaz&#257;n&#299; (d. 1390)
replies to this argument by drawing a difference between two kinds of
negation. It is one thing to say that four would not be an even
number. It is another thing to say that four would be a non-even
number. The first proposition is true. If someone makes four to be an
even number, then in the absence of that someone, there is no four
and, hence, four is not an even number. The second, metathetic
proposition, however, is false as it accepts that there would still be
four and it would be a non-even number. For al-Taftaz&#257;n&#299;,
Avicenna&rsquo;s argument confuses the two types of negation.
Accepting that God made four four leads to accepting the first type of
negation only (in the absence of God, there is no four, and, hence, it
is not even), but not the metathetic type of negation (in the absence
of God, four is a non-even number). Based on this and similar
arguments, the doctrine of the &ldquo;creation of essence&rdquo;
(<em>ja&#703;l al-mahiyya</em>) is commonly accepted in the
post-Avicennan tradition, both by authors who generally present
themselves as anti-Avicennists and Avicennists (Ibrahim 2020).</p>

<p>
Turning back to Mull&#257; &#7778;adr&#257; and the doctrine of the
primacy of existence, we can now see its implications. Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257; rejects the traditional view that God creates
essences, which had become mainstream by his time. Instead,
&#7778;adr&#257; suggests that God creates existence. He does not mean
it in the same sense as Avicenna did. Whichever way we understand
Avicenna&rsquo;s doctrine of the creation of existent things, it must
preserve the reality of both essence and existence. One could say, for
instance, that Avicenna&rsquo;s God creates the existence of a cup in
the first place, and&mdash;by implication&mdash;its essence as well
(it would work at least for those commentators who reject the priority
of essence over existence for Avicenna). On the contrary, for
&#7778;adr&#257;, God just creates existence. As for the essence,
there is nothing to create there in the first place, since all
essences merely are conceptual considerations (Ibrahim 2020).</p>

<p>
The historical roots of &#7778;adrian doctrine of the primacy of
existence and his existence-based ontological monism lie in the works
of the Sufi philosophers Ibn &#703;Arab&#299; and &#7778;adr
al-D&#299;n al-Q&#363;naw&#299;. This tradition establishes universal
monism through the unity of existence (<em>wa&#7717;dat
al-wuj&#363;d</em>). For the Sufis, God&rsquo;s existence, in fact, is
the only existence in the world. Everything other than God is a mere
manifestation of His existence (Chittick 1981 and 1989).</p>

<p>
The tradition of ontological monism gradually impacts Islamic
metaphysics of essence and existence after the fourteenth century.
Jal&#257;l al-D&#299;n al-Daw&#257;n&#299; (d. 1502) argues, for
instance, that God is the only existence (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) in the
world. Everything else is &ldquo;existent&rdquo;
(<em>mawj&#363;d</em>). Created things are, in a sense, derivatives of
God&rsquo;s existence without having any reality of their own. This
way of expressing himself has led to al-Daw&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s
rival, &#7778;adr al-D&#299;n al-Dashtak&#299; (d. 1498), accusing
al-Daw&#257;n&#299; of mixing up philosophical and Sufi concepts.
However, describing al-Daw&#257;n&#299; simply as an ontological
monist is problematic (Pourjavady 2017). Similarly,
al-Daw&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s views on the creation of essences may be
interpreted as aligning with Mull&#257; &#7778;adr&#257;&rsquo;s
direction, but there seem to have been different interpretations of
al-Daw&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s position regarding the creation of essence
already in the Islamic philosophical tradition itself (Ibrahim
2020).</p>

<p>
Mull&#257; &#7778;adr&#257;&rsquo;s doctrine of the primacy of
existence signifies an important turn in the history of the analysis
of essence and existence in Islamic philosophy. It continues to define
the ways of Islamic metaphysics in the modern period until our days
(Pourjavady 2019).</p>
