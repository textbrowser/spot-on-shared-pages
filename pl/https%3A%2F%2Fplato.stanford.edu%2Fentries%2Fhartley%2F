<em>Engraving by William Blake, 1791</em></p>

<h1>David Hartley</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 25, 2002; substantive revision Thu Sep 4, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
David Hartley (1705&ndash;57) is the author of <em>Observations on
Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations</em> (1749)&mdash;a
synthesis of neurology, psychology, and spirituality.</p>

<p>
As science, the <em>Observations</em> grounds consciousness in
neurophysiology, mind in brain. On this basis, the central concept of
&ldquo;association,&rdquo; much discussed by other British
philosophers and psychologists, receives distinctive treatment: the
term first names the physiological processes that generate
&ldquo;ideas&rdquo; and then the psychological processes by which
perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and fuse or break
apart. In keeping with this approach, Hartley offers a novel account
of how we learn and perform skilled actions, a dimension of human
nature often left unexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions
include those involved in speech&mdash;and, by extension, the conduct
of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>
Central to the moral psychology is a typology of six emotional
schemas: Imagination, Ambition, Self-Interest, Sympathy, Theopathy,
and the Moral Sense. Taken together, the six schemas form a picture of
human beings driven, and guided, by what they experience as
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; pleasures and pains. The six are
generative, as, for example, Imagination &ldquo;models&rdquo; (in the
sense of shapes or forms) Ambition, and also cybernetic, as Sympathy
&ldquo;new models&rdquo; Self-Interest. The picture is dynamic and
teleological. For example, a person whose &ldquo;primary
pursuit&rdquo; is Ambition will find the pursuit itself inevitably
leads to both satisfaction and discontent. The inability of Ambition
to solve the problem it creates thus pushes the person onward to a
hedonic economics, Self-Interest, and then, when the problems
generated by the pursuit of Self-Interest also prove insoluble,
potentially toward a further reorientation of one&rsquo;s
&ldquo;primary pursuit&rdquo; in a new sense of self grounded in
Sympathy&mdash;which in turn leads the person to re-evaluate what
truly counts as self-interest.</p>

<p>
Regarding our &ldquo;expectations,&rdquo; Hartley imagines that in
&ldquo;the true system of things &hellip; the voice of nature is an
universal chorus of joy and transport,&rdquo; and that within it our
&ldquo;expectations&rdquo; can rest upon the assurance of universal
salvation: all people will eventually become &ldquo;partakers of the
divine nature, loving and lovely, holy and happy&rdquo; (<em>OM</em>
2, prop. 56). In this regard, the <em>Observations</em> presents an
original model of spiritual growth, which describes how the self both
forms and transforms as the person gains in Sympathy and
Theopathy&mdash;put simply, learns to love, both others and God.</p>

<p>
Hartley&rsquo;s synthesis rests on two core concepts:
&ldquo;philosophical necessity&rdquo; and divine causality. Given the
&ldquo;previous circumstances of body and mind&rdquo; that form the
nexus of the present moment, &ldquo;a person cannot do indifferently
of the actions <em>A,</em> and its contrary <em>a</em>&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 1, Conclusion). Nonetheless, &ldquo;since God is the
cause of all things, &hellip; he must be the cause of all the motions
in the material world&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 30). Together, the
two provided assurance for people committed to religious and social
reform. We live, as it were, as fish in a sea of physical, social, and
cognitive events, but a sea radiant with light. Clear the water and
the light will shine through.</p>

<p>
The son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705
in the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months
after his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After
receiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley
practiced medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730&ndash;35), London
(1735&ndash;42), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married
twice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their
son David (1731&ndash;1813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer
(1713&ndash;78), despite the opposition of her wealthy family. The
couple had two children, Mary (1736&ndash;1803) and Wincombe Henry
(1740&ndash;94). Although severely afflicted with bladder stones,
Hartley lived a full and active life: he practiced medicine, engaged
in mathematical research, sought a cure for &ldquo;the stone,&rdquo;
devoted himself to intellectual and philanthropic projects, and wrote
the <em>Observations on Man.</em> Two days after the event, <em>London
Evening Post</em> noted: &ldquo;His Death is much lamented by the
Poor.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="ReceObseMan">1. Reception of the <em>Observations on Man</em></h2>

<p>
In the century after its publication, the <em>Observations</em>
inspired people committed to religious, social, and political reform,
for it provided grounding for their labors: changing people&rsquo;s
&ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; will change their lives for the better.
Writing in 1774, Joseph Priestley, prominent Unitarian and
experimental scientist, wrote that the <em>Observations</em>
&ldquo;contains a new and most extensive science&rdquo; and promised
that &ldquo;the study of it &hellip; will be like entering upon a new
world.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;I think myself more indebted to this
one treatise, than to all the books I ever read beside; the scriptures
excepted&rdquo; (1774, xix). Priestley&rsquo;s comment on the
&ldquo;new science&rdquo; refers to Part 1 of the
<em>Observations,</em> &ldquo;Containing Observations on the Frame of
the Human Body and Mind, and on their Mutual Connections and
Influences.&rdquo; What he said about his debt to &ldquo;this one
treatise&rdquo; encompasses the whole book, including the moral and
spiritual counsel in Part 2, &ldquo;Containing Observations on the
Duty and Expectations of Mankind.&rdquo; When Priestley and his wife
fled England for America in 1794, Priestley turned to
<em>Observations</em> for consolation during the long sea journey.</p>

<p>
In her autobiography, written in 1877, Harriet Martineau recalled how
in 1821, at age 19, she studied the <em>Observations</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
with a fervour and perservance which made it perhaps the most
important book in the world to me, except the bible. &hellip; I cannot
at this hour look at the portrait of Hartley prefixed to this work
&hellip; without a strong revival of the old mood of earnest desire of
self-discipline, and devotion to duty which I derived from them in my
youth. &hellip; I owe to Hartley the strongest and best stimulus and
discipline of the highest affections and most important habits that it
is perhaps possible &hellip; to derive from any book. (Martineau 1877,
1:104&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Martineau, the real-life sister of George Eliot&rsquo;s Dorothea
Brooke, could have had in mind the moral and spiritual counsel in the
&ldquo;The Rule of Life,&rdquo; chapter 3 in part 2 of this,
&ldquo;the holy book for millennarian perfectionism&rdquo; (Kramnick
1986, 15). The portrait is the frontispiece to the 1791 quarto edition
(shown above), printed by the radical publisher Joseph Johnson.</p>

<p>
Priestley and his fellow Unitarians gave the <em>Observations</em> a
central place in the curriculum in the dissenting academies. (For
admission to Oxford and Cambridge Universities, students had to
subscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England.) From one report,
we learn that students studied it for two hours every morning. The
poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, converted to Priestleian Unitarianism at
Cambridge, had his portrait painted holding his copy of the
<em>Observations</em> (see Paley 1999, 18&ndash;23) and named his
first son David Hartley Coleridge. Few works discussed in this
encyclopedia have been the object of such deep personal
involvement.</p>

<p>
However, others thought differently. During the &lsquo;Priestley
Riots&rsquo; in July 1791, a &lsquo;Church and King&rsquo; mob burned
Priestley&rsquo;s home and laboratory to the ground. To the
mob&rsquo;s organizers and sympathizers, any work &ldquo;Gunpowder
Joe&rdquo; Priestley praised so highly would be anathema. Thus, while
the <em>Observations</em> kept its status as a &ldquo;holy book&rdquo;
for those committed to religious, social and political reform, these
were an embattled minority in England, especially during and after the
French Revolution. In addition, critics&mdash;including Thomas Reid
(1785, 84&ndash;94) and the later Coleridge ([1817] 2014), no longer
the youthful radical&mdash;considered Hartley&rsquo;s
<em>Observations</em> both conceptually wrong and morally hazardous.
The Scottish philosopher Sir James Mackintosh, who sympathetically
praised &ldquo;the extraordinary value of Hartley&rsquo;s
system&rdquo; in the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica,</em> 7th edition,
nonetheless saw Hartley standing on the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; of
materialism and guilty of &ldquo;the error &hellip; deeper and more
fundamental than any other&rdquo;&mdash;the one that &ldquo;overlooks
the primordial and perpetual distinction between <em>the being which
thinks</em> and <em>the thing which is thought of</em> ;&mdash;not to
be lost sight of, by the mind&rsquo;s eye, even for a twinkling,
without involving all nature in darkness and confusion&rdquo; (1830,
362; also 1836, 252).</p>

<p>
In the mid-nineteenth century, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and
William B. Carpenter (who all had studied the <em>Observations</em> in
dissenting academies), along with Alexander Bain, founded the school
of thought known as &ldquo;association psychology&rdquo; and credited
Hartley with being the precursor of the science. However, John Stuart
Mill wrote in the Preface to the 1869 edition of his father&rsquo;s
<em>Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind</em>, that, compared
to his father&rsquo;s work, Hartley&rsquo;s <em>Observations</em>
&ldquo;is little more than a sketch, though an eminently suggestive
one&rdquo; (Mill 1869, 1:xi&ndash;12). The last serious engagement
with the <em>Observations</em> appears in William James&rsquo;s
<em>Principles of Psychology</em> (1890, 1:553), and there a casual
reader could miss it.</p>

<p>
In the past hundred years, a fair portion of the scholarly literature
relating to Hartley concerns his influence on Wordsworth, Coleridge,
and other Romantics (see. e.g., Beatty 1922, Pearsall 1970, and Ulmer
2013 on Wordsworth, Waples 1936 and Hatch 1974 on Coleridge, and
Schopf 1981 on Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em>). Other
articles about Hartley appear in journals of the behavioral and
neurological sciences. However, there is less attention to
Hartley&rsquo;s <em>Observations</em> by academic philosophers. One
reason might be the sheer volume of observations&mdash;Priestley
cautioned that the book is not one &ldquo;a man can read over in a few
evenings, so to be ready to give a satisfactory account of it to any
of his friends&rdquo; (1774, xix), and R.K. Webb called the book
&ldquo;a vast haystack&rdquo; (Webb 1998, 28). Another may be that the
&ldquo;new and most extensive science&rdquo; was ahead of its time.
Leslie Stephen, in 1876 wrote that &ldquo;it is plain that Hartley and
Priestley could not get beyond the very first step. Their method, if
properly carried out, would involve a complete study of the
organisation and functions of the brain and nervous system; but, in
the contemporary state of physiological knowledge, the very outlines
of such a theory were not even dimly perceptible&rdquo; (Stephen 1881,
68). A further reason may be, in the modern university, the division
of knowledge among academic departments, professional societies, and
scholarly journals. Basil Willey wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
Throughout his <em>Observations on Man</em> (1749) there is to be
found a characteristic blend&mdash;rare even in England after the
eighteenth century, and by that time virtually extinct in
France&mdash;of scientific ardour with religious certainty. Hartley
was a man of unusual originality and penetration, and he writes with
the zest of one who knows he is engaged in pioneering work, but who
feels, at the same time, that he is building up morality and religion
on unshakable foundations. &hellip; It is Hartley&rsquo;s distinction
that he evolves his religion, not from the starry heavens, but from a
study of human psychology. (Willey 1940, 136&ndash;37)
</blockquote>

<p>
Today, there are scientists who embody both scientific ardor and
religious commitments. Nonetheless, it is hard to imagine a
psychologist, philosopher, or theologian in good standing making a
career of &ldquo;building up morality and religion&rdquo; on the
&ldquo;unshakable foundations&rdquo; of human psychology. Those
engaged in the neuroscience of &ldquo;religious
cognition&rdquo;&mdash;or who, like Richard T. G. Walsh, encourage
psychologists to &ldquo;incorporate religious, spiritual, and moral
aspects of the human condition in the discipline&rsquo;s theory,
practice, and curricula&rdquo; (2017, 61)&mdash;refrain from claiming
that their researches provide a such a foundation. To gain an
appreciation of Hartley, and of what we can learn from him, we need to
leave &lsquo;our&rsquo; world and step into his.</p>

<h2 id="HartObseFirsSigh">2. Hartley&rsquo;s <em>Observations</em>&mdash;At First Sight</h2>

<p>
Let us imagine how one of Hartley&rsquo;s colleagues, a Fellow of the
Royal Society (FRS), might have responded to the book on its
appearance in 1749. A FRS would know that the author had emerged the
victor in a public medical controversy ten years earlier. Hartley,
working with Stephen Hales, researched the chemical basis for what
they thought an effective folk remedy for bladder stones&mdash;a
painful and hazardous condition that impaired the lives of Hartley
himself and many others, including Benjamin Franklin. In the course of
the controversy, Hartley had published a self-revealing account of the
prolonged and intense suffering he had endured while undergoing the
treatment (Hartley 1738).</p>

<p>
The FRS would know that this orphaned son of a Yorkshire clergyman was
now a successful physician, thanks in part to powerful patrons
(including the Cornwallis family, and the Duke of Newcastle, who was
in effect prime minister), had come into wealth thanks to his second
marriage, and that he devoted himself to philanthropic projects. He
promoted the shorthand system devised by his friend, John Byrom, and
was the force behind the publication of the monumental <em>Elements of
Algebra</em> (1740) by Nicholas Saunderson, who had become Lucasian
Professor of Mathematics despite being blinded in infancy by smallpox.
The FRS would also know that Hartley had a special interest in
statistics. His first publication, on variola inoculation for smallpox
(1733), relied on a statistical argument to show that, despite the
risk of death, it was in a person&rsquo;s individual interest to be
inoculated. The FRS may have also have known that Hartley was in
possession of a foundational paper on <em>inverse probability,</em>
possibly sent to him by fellow FRS Thomas Bayes (see Stigler
1983).</p>

<p>
If the FRS knew Hartley as a friend, he would know him to be an
amateur violinist, a vegetarian, and a husband and father (unlike
Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant, all single men). He would know that
Hartley was often in extreme pain, as he still suffered grievously
from bladder stones.</p>

<p>
In 1736, Hartley shared with friends two handwritten drafts:
&ldquo;The Progress of Happiness Derived from Reason&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Progress of Happiness Derived from Scripture.&rdquo; If the
FRS had read the first of these, upon opening the
<em>Observations</em> he would have been familiar with key themes. One
appears at the end of part 1 of <em>Observations</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It does indeed follow from this theory, that matter, if it could be
endued with the most simple kinds of sensation, might also arrive at
all that intelligence of which the human mind is possessed.
(<em>OM</em> 1, Conclusion)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite the &ldquo;if,&rdquo; Hartley did think living organisms are
&ldquo;endued with &hellip; sensation,&rdquo; and, in neurologically
complex species, possessing their own kinds of intelligence. Their
&ldquo;near relation&rdquo; to us obligates us &ldquo;to be their
guardians and benefactors&rdquo; and thus to refrain from making them
suffer for our sport or convenience, and from killing them for food
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 93; cf. <em>OM</em> 2, prop. 52). Following this
theme, Hartley&rsquo;s project in the <em>Observations</em> is to
start with the &ldquo;most simple kinds of sensation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;arrive at all that intelligence of which the human mind is
possessed.&rdquo; The project presents itself as properly scientific
through the use of &ldquo;Observations&rdquo; in the title (cf.
Franklin&rsquo;s <em>Experiments and Observations on Electricity</em>,
1751, and Priestley&rsquo;s <em>Experiments and Observations of
Different Kinds of Air</em>, 1774), and through the geometrical format
of propositions and corollaries that structures the text. The FRS
would also see that the Hartley wrote for readers familiar with
technical concepts in anatomy and physiology, and in Newton&rsquo;s
<em>Principia</em> and the speculative physics in the
<em>Opticks.</em> The FRS would also know that Hartley was following
in the footsteps of others, such as Descartes, in taking a scientific
approach to &ldquo;man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Were the reader to continue beyond the opening propositions of the
<em>Observations</em>, he would encounter Hartley&rsquo;s other great
theme: &ldquo;The great business and purport of the present life is
the transformation of sensuality into spirituality&rdquo; (<em>OM</em>
2, prop. 50; cf. Leslie 1974, 631). Along with being a scientific
work, the FRS would also understand the <em>Observations</em> to be a
moral treatise, one tracing the path by which this transformation can
take effect. He would encounter affirmation of the &ldquo;everlasting
gospel&rdquo; of universal salvation proclaimed by various writers in
England, including the visionary Jane Lead and her follower Richard
Roach (see Dixon 2023). Moreover, endorsements of &ldquo;mental prayer
&hellip; the aspiration of the heart to God without words&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 78) and &ldquo;perfect self-annihilation, and
the pure love of God&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 67) suggest an
alignment with Quietists in Europe. On the shelves of Hartley&rsquo;s
library a friend would find Thomas &agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s
<em>L&rsquo; Imitation de Jesus Christ</em> (French translation,
1714), Madame Guyon&rsquo;s <em>L&rsquo;&Acirc;me Amante de son
Dieu</em> (1717), and the works of John of the Cross in Latin (1639)
and French (1694) translations (see Allen 1999, 331&ndash;56, esp.
347&ndash;48).</p>

<h2 id="ScieMan">3. Vibrations and Associations&mdash;from Physics to Physiology to Psychology</h2>

<p>
In writing the <em>Observations</em>, Hartley meant to contribute to
the science of &ldquo;man.&rdquo; Looking into the future, he also
imagined a grand unified theory, to be achieved when people in
&ldquo;future ages may analyse all the actions of bodies upon each
other, up to a few simple principles&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 15).
Newton had taken giant steps in this direction, especially with the
unification of celestial and terrestial mechanics in his law of
universal gravitation. A century later, Darwin did the same with
another simple principle, natural selection. Hartley provided names
for another two such principles: first, &ldquo;vibrations,&rdquo;
uniting world and brain, physics and neurophysiology, and second,
&ldquo;association,&rdquo; the analogue to gravitation, as the
foundational principle accounting for all psychological phenomena,
from perception to personality.</p>

<p>
By way of context, two figures stand out: Descartes and Newton.
Hartley wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It may afford the reader some entertainment to compare my hypothesis
with what Des Cartes and Leibniz have advanced, concerning animal
motion, and the connexion between the soul and the body. My general
plan bears a near relation to theirs. Des Cartes might have had
success in the execution of his, as proposed at the beginning of his
<em>Treatise on Man</em>, had he been furnished with a proper
assemblage of facts from anatomy, physiology, pathology, and
philosophy. (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo; <em>Treatise on Man</em> begins with a thought
experiment: he asks us to picture an inaminate &ldquo;statue, an
earthen machine&rdquo; similar to &ldquo;clocks, artificial fountains,
mills, and similar machines&rdquo; ([1662/64] 1972, 1&ndash;4). He
then provides this machine with all the physiological functions of
human bodies, including those of the brain.</p>

<p>
Ang&eacute;lique Th&eacute;bert situates Hartley &ldquo;in the
wake&rdquo; of Descartes, Leibniz, and Malebranche and characterizes
him as &ldquo;more Cartesian than Descartes&rdquo; (2014, 430). A fair
point, as both take &ldquo;body&rdquo; as their starting point. But in
what way did Hartley&rsquo;s &ldquo;general plan&rdquo; bear a
&ldquo;near relation&rdquo; to those of Descartes and Leibniz? Did the
&ldquo;near relation&rdquo; primarily concern &ldquo;animal
motion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the connexion between soul and body,&rdquo;
or both? In what way did Hartley think his <em>Observations</em>
provided &ldquo;a proper assemblange of facts&rdquo; that
Descartes&rsquo; <em>Treatise on Man</em> lacked? And did Hartley
think the result was simply Descartes&rsquo; &ldquo;Earthen Machine
2.0,&rdquo; or something more?</p>

<p>
How one models the relation between &ldquo;world&rdquo; and
&ldquo;brain&rdquo; depends on what one takes &ldquo;world&rdquo; to
be&mdash;that is, upon one&rsquo;s understanding of physics. In
Hartley&rsquo;s day, there were two main models. Descartes&rsquo;
position was that the universe consists of &ldquo;vortices&rdquo; of
matter filling a cosmic ocean, that matter is infinitely divisible,
and that all motion occurs through contact. Newton differed on all
points: space is absolute, independent of matter; atoms represent the
limit of divisibility; and changes in particles&rsquo; positions and
momenta are attributable to forces other than contact mechanism.
Within the Cartesian model, nerves are hollow tubes with a fluid of
&ldquo;animal spirits&rdquo; running within them. The tubes function
by hydraulic pressure. Note that the &ldquo;machines&rdquo; Descartes
mentions&mdash;&ldquo;clocks, artificial fountains,
mills&rdquo;&mdash;do, or can, run on water power. This was the
position of both Descartes and Hermann Boerhaave (1668&ndash;1738),
the renowned &ldquo;father of physiology&rdquo; at the University of
Leiden. In contrast, to Newton and his followers nerves are not tubes;
Hartley, using Newton&rsquo;s term, calls them &ldquo;solid
capillaments&rdquo; and notes that &ldquo;the best injectors&rdquo;
have failed to force fluids through them (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 5).
Transmission of a signal along them cannot be a matter of hydraulic
pressure. There has to be another mechanism accounting for reception
of a stimulus by ears, eyes, nose, and skin and transmission of the
signal to the brain. To put it simply, where Descartes saw plumbing,
Newton saw electrical circuits.</p>

<p>
Near the beginning of the <em>Observations</em> Hartley writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Sir Isaac Newton supposes, that a very subtle fluid and elastic fluid,
which he calls <em>aether</em>, for sake of treating upon it
commodiously upon an appropriated name, is diffused through the pores
of gross bodies. &hellip; To the action of this aether he ascribes the
attractions and repulsions of electrical bodies, the mutual influences
of bodies and light upon each other, the effects and communication of
heat, and the performance of animal sensation and motion. My business
in these observations is only with the last [of these]. (<em>OM</em>
1, prop. 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hartley then refers the reader to the final paragraph of the General
Scholium of the <em>Principia</em> (3d ed., 1726) and to the Queries
added to the third book of Newton&rsquo;s <em>Opticks.</em> At the end
of the latter, in Query 31, Newton says that he is &ldquo;leaving the
Hints to be examined and improv&rsquo;d by the farther Experiments and
Observations. &hellip; And if Natural Philosophy in all its parts, by
pursuing this Method, shall at length be perfected, the bounds of
Moral Philosophy will also be enlarged&rdquo; ([1717] 1730). Hartley
receives his commission from Newton&rsquo;s statement. Still, a
commission is one thing, how to find the Grail of a
&ldquo;perfected&rdquo; Natural Philosophy another. Hartley admitted:
&ldquo;I am not satisfied that I understand him perfectly on this
subject&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 5). He was not alone.</p>

<p>
In Query 31 of the <em>Opticks</em>, Newton stated that &ldquo;Bodies
are much more rare and porous than is commonly believed&rdquo; (1730,
242), and offered a model of matter as a fractal lattice. To
illustrate this, Henry Pemberton, one of Newton&rsquo;s interpreters,
suggested picturing a cube of salt crystals joined at their corners,
and then a cube of these cubes, etc. The more generations, the less
atomic matter there is in the whole: &ldquo;all the known bodies in
the universe together, may be compounded of no greater portion of
solid matter, than might be reduced to a globe of one inch only in
diameter&rdquo; (Pemberton 1728, 291). Priestley later put it:
&ldquo;all the solid matter in the solar system might be contained in
a nut-shell&rdquo; (1777a, 17). Add to this a second line of
speculation, following from Newton&rsquo;s attribution of &ldquo;the
attractions and repulsions of electrical bodies&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;aether.&rdquo; Where Descartes imagined a cosmic ocean of
matter, the knights of Newton&rsquo;s round table imagined the
opposite: a universe in which atoms are little more than virtually
dimensionless point particles, set vibrating by the
attractive/repulsive forces of the &lsquo;aether&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Speculative physics, but with a practical result: Hartley&rsquo;s work
with Stephen Hales on a remedy for bladder stones. Hales
(1677&ndash;1761), remembered today as the father of plant physiology
and for the measurement of blood pressure, developed his chemical
theory in his <em>Statical Essays</em>&mdash;i.e., <em>Vegetable
Staticks</em> (1727) and <em>Haemastaticks</em> (1733). Following
Newton, Hales believed &ldquo;forces of attraction and
repulsion&rdquo; to be the basis of physical nature. Thus he proposed
that &ldquo;air&rdquo; is a component in many &ldquo;animal,
vegetable, and mineral substances&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If all the parts of matter were only endued with a strongly attracting
power, whole nature would then immediately become one unactive
cohering lump; wherefore it was absolutely necessary &hellip; that
there should be every where intermixed with it a due proportion of
strongly repelling elastick particles, &hellip; [and] that these
particles should be endued with a property of resuming their elastick
state, . . . that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be
maintained in a continual round of the production and dissolution of
animal and vegetable bodies. (Hales 1769, 1:314&ndash;15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Through his chemical experiments Hales demonstrated that solid
concretions, including bladder stones, locked within themselves large
quantities of &ldquo;air,&rdquo; which normally manifests a strongly
repelling force. Hales proposed that reaction with an agent that
changed the pH of the urine could release the &ldquo;air&rdquo; within
a bladder stone and thus cause the stone to disintegrate. Such
chemicals were plentiful in the laboratory; Hales and Hartley were
looking for one that a person could safely ingest. They thought they
had found one in a remedy one Joanna Stephens had cooked up in her
kitchen, and Hartley took the lead in convincing Parliament to pay Mrs
Stephens &pound;5,000 for her &ldquo;secret.&rdquo; In 1739 Parliament
passed the act, and Hales won the Copely Medal of the Royal Society
for his effort. Hartley took the medicine but was never cured (see
Allen 1999, 53&ndash;72).]</p>

<p>
Those following in the wake of Newton pictured the universe as mostly
empty space: perhaps no more than Priestley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;nut-shell&rdquo; of atomic matter in the &ldquo;aether,&rdquo;
the immaterial medium, or field, bearing forces of attraction and
repulsion. What appear to be physical objects &mdash; stones,
nutshells, nerves&mdash;are places where forces are in dynamic, and
conditional, equilibrium. Any change in force will cause what Hartley,
following Boerhaave, calls the &ldquo;molecules&rdquo; constituting
them to &ldquo;vibrate,&rdquo; and if the vibrations are strong
enough, to break apart. In physical objects concretions and
dissolutions occur continuously; the materials within the bodies of
living things form, dissolve, and form again&mdash;&ldquo;that thereby
this beautiful frame of things might be maintained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The first chapter of Hartley&rsquo;s <em>Observations</em> is devoted
to working out in detail how a &ldquo;doctrine of vibrations&rdquo;
can be applied to the brain and nervous system (see Allen 1999,
83&ndash;129). To do this, he turns to Newton&rsquo;s accounts of
harmonic motion and the analogy between the color spectrum and the
musical octave. This is the best he can do. Today, we can describe
&ldquo;action potentials&rdquo; in great detail, while Hartley,
lacking even &ldquo;neuron&rdquo; and &ldquo;voltage,&rdquo; treats
&ldquo;vibration,&rdquo; when applied to the nervous system, as an
algebraic unknown. Like Newton&rsquo;s &ldquo;aether,&rdquo; it
enables us to treat a range of phenomena &ldquo;commodiously upon an
appropriated name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Imagine two &ldquo;earthen men,&rdquo; the first inhabiting a
Cartesian world, the second in a Newtonian one &mdash;the nerves and
brain of the first plumbing, of the second, aetherial circuits. How
would they differ? Could it be said of either that they sense, feel,
think? The answer, according to Malebranche, was no: lacking souls,
even animals are automatons, unable to feel pain or pleasure. Over the
centuries, many have attributed the same view to Descartes. What about
a Hartleian &ldquo;aetherial man&rdquo;?</p>

<p>
The <em>Observations</em> begins: &ldquo;Man consists of two parts,
body and mind. The first is subjected to our senses and inquiries, in
the same manner as the other parts of the material world. The last is
that substance, agent, principle, &amp;c. to which we refer the
sensations, ideas, pleasures, pains, and voluntary motions.&rdquo;
Although Hartley speaks of &ldquo;two parts,&rdquo; his definitions of
the terms &ldquo;body&rdquo; and &ldquo;mind&rdquo; are nominal, not
substantive; they point toward human activities of sensing, inquiring,
and talking about experiences. In the &ldquo;Scholium&rdquo; to the
first chapter of the <em>Observations</em>, Hartley writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The quantity of matter in bodies is always found to be proportional to
their gravity: we may therefore either make the quantity of matter the
exponent of the gravity, or the gravity the exponent of it, &hellip;
notwithstanding that we are entirely at a loss to determine, in what
mechanical way each atom contributes to the gravity of the whole mass;
and even though we should, with some, suppose this effect to be
immechanical, and to arise from the immediate agency of God. And, by
parity of reason, if that species of motions we term vibrations, can
be shown to attend &hellip; upon all sensations, ideas, and motions,
&hellip; then we are at liberty either to make vibrations the exponent
of these sensations, ideas, and motions, or these the exponents of
vibrations, as best suits the inquiry; however impossible it may be to
discover in what way vibrations cause, or are connected with
sensations, or ideas; &hellip; (<em>OM</em> 1, chap. 1, Scholium).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hartley&rsquo;s method here, as in much of the <em>Observations</em>,
is to stay within the bounds of the observable. Just as he uses
&ldquo;vibrations&rdquo; when talking about neural activity, he views
&ldquo;mind&rdquo; as a placeholder for the unobservable something
&ldquo;to which we refer&rdquo; when speaking of mental phenomena. It
is another &ldquo;appropriated name.&rdquo; In other words, Hartley
did not subscribe to either Descartes&rsquo; substance dualism or
Malebranche&rsquo;s occasionalism. For Hartley, words relating to
physical and mental phenomena remain in a semantic
&lsquo;superposition&rsquo;&mdash;until it &ldquo;best suits the
inquiry&rdquo; to treat one as the reality and the other the exponent.
Hartley was an advocate of what we today call neutral monism. On the
one hand, he was firm advocate of the &ldquo;doctrine of philosophical
necessity&rdquo; and critic of &ldquo;philosophical liberty.&rdquo; On
the other, we are not deluded in experiencing ourselves
&ldquo;deliberating, suspending, choosing, &amp;c., or of resisting
the motives of sensuality, ambition, resentment, &amp;c.,&rdquo; so
that free will, &ldquo;under certain limitations, is not only
consistent with the doctrine of mechanism, but even flows from
it&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, Conclusion). What we need to recognize is
that available to us are &ldquo;two different methods of speaking, as
it were, languages &hellip; the one popular, and, when applied to God,
anthromorphical; the other philosophical&rdquo;; it is only when
&ldquo;we mix these languages&rdquo; that &ldquo;insuperable
difficulties arise&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 15). See section 7
below; compare Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em>, part 2, prop. 7, and
Jonathan Edward&rsquo;s <em>Freedom on the Will.</em></p>

<h2 id="PercActiRoleJoinImpr">4. Perception and Action: The Role of &ldquo;Joint Impression&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
The &ldquo;association of ideas&rdquo; is the phrase primarily
associated with &ldquo;Hartley.&rdquo; However, although
&ldquo;association&rdquo; is central concept in the
<em>Observations</em>, it is not a primarily a name for the process by
which discrete &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; already present to the
&ldquo;mind&rdquo; connect. Rather, Hartley&rsquo;s starting point is
the living organism, and specifically the physical
&ldquo;vibrations&rdquo; present in brain and nervous system and in
the &ldquo;aetherial&rdquo; universe with which the organism
interacts. Using the language of &ldquo;corporeal causes,&rdquo;
Hartley proposes:</p>

<blockquote>
Since therefore sensations are conveyed to the mind, by the efficiency
of corporeal causes &hellip; it seems to me, that the powers of
generating ideas, and raising them by association, must also arise
from corporeal causes, and consequently admit of an explication from
the subtle influences of the small parts of matter on each other, as
soon as these are sufficiently understood. But then (which is very
remarkable) this power of forming ideas, and their corresponding
miniature vibrations, does equally presuppose the power of
association. For since all sensations and vibrations are infinitely
divisible, in respect of time and place, they could not leave any
traces or images of themselves, i.e. any ideas, or miniature
vibrations, unless their infinitesimal parts did cohere together
through joint impression, i.e. association. (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 11)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hartley starts with bodily, specifically neurological processes, and
asks: how do such processes <em>generate</em> and <em>raise</em> our
perceptions, emotions, thoughts, and actions? For Hartley, the
foundation is simple: nerves &ldquo;vibrate&rdquo; (on a molecular
level, not as violin strings), change their frequencies and amplitudes
of vibration, and transmit those changes to other nerves. Thanks to
the vast number of associative connections within the brain, this
fundamental mechanism generates all the complexities of perception,
cognition, action, motivation, and personality that we observe in
living beings. Thus &ldquo;the whole superstructure of ideas and
associations observable in human life may &hellip; be built upon as
small a foundation as we please&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 11).</p>

<p>
In saying that the &ldquo;infinitesimal parts&rdquo; must
&ldquo;cohere together through joint impression,&rdquo; Hartley is
elaborating a point made by George Berkeley in his <em>Essay Towards a
New Theory of Vision</em> ([1709] 1948), that a being born
&lsquo;blind&rsquo; to bodily feeling and possessing only sight would
have no concept of space and would be unable to perceive a
geometrically ordered world. To such a being, visual sensations would
convey no information; they would be
&ldquo;infinitely&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., arbitrarily&mdash;divisible. No
stable, repeatable, memorable &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; could arise from
them. Hartley also agrees with Berkeley&rsquo;s solution to this
problem: we perceive a coherent, intelligible world thanks to the
generation of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; (perceptual, cognitive, semantic,
and pragmatic responses to the world) through the &ldquo;joint
impression&rdquo; of sensations from distinct sensory
modalities&mdash;sight, hearing, and especially touch&mdash;what
psychologists today call intermodal perception. As does Berkeley,
Hartley identifies feeling or touch as &ldquo;the fundamental source
of information in respect of the essential properties of matter&rdquo;
and &ldquo;our first and principle key to the knowledge of the
external world&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 30; think of a newborn).
Thus, Hartley writes, &ldquo;we call the touch the reality, light the
representative.&rdquo; The sense of sight &ldquo;may be considered,
agreeably to Bishop Berkeley&rsquo;s remark, as a philosophical
language for the ideas of feeling&rdquo; (see Berkeley [1709] 1948,
sections 6.4, 6.8, and 9.4).</p>

<p>
A &ldquo;philosophical language&rdquo; is one &ldquo;without any
deficiency, superfluity, or equivocation&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop.
83), and what makes sight a &ldquo;philosophical language&rdquo; for
feeling is that the two match each other: &ldquo;The same qualities
are made by means of light to impress vibrations on our eyes, which
correspond in great measure to those made on the sense of feeling, so
as to vary with their varieties&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 30).
Feeling and vision flow in tandem, usually with no missing,
extraneous, or equivocal moves. It is thus &ldquo;joint
impression,&rdquo; the correlation of the flows of sensation through
two or more sensory modalities, so that the sensations of one
&ldquo;vary with the varieties&rdquo; of another, that accounts for
the fact that we have &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; at all. The
&ldquo;ideas&rdquo; formed from visual and tactile &ldquo;traces or
images&rdquo; are what we could call video-tactile clips, not static
snapshots. In contrast, a person whose visual inputs are dissociated
from his other sensory modalities, and especially his own movement and
feeling, would be unable to consistently identify any &ldquo;visual
ideas.&rdquo; Such is the condition of a person suffering from a
visual agnosia (see James 1890, 1:48&ndash;50; also the Molyneux
problem).</p>

<p>
Thanks to &ldquo;joint impression&rdquo; and
&ldquo;association,&rdquo; an &ldquo;idea&rdquo; will be a locus for
information from multiple modalities. For example, linked to the word
&lsquo;apple&rsquo; are immediate visual perceptions, both of actual
apples and photographs, prints, and paintings of them; smells; sounds,
as of crunching; memories of picking, buying, or selling apples;
hearing, saying, reading, writing the word; poems and metaphors
(&ldquo;the apple of one&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;); the &ldquo;factitious
sagacity&rdquo; (Hartley&rsquo;s term) of orchardmen; social
interactions in which apples played some part; the meanings we assign
to all of the above; and the apple-directed intentions we form. The
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; is a copious container. And note that many of the
linked elements relate, not to static visual images, but to doing,
often in social contexts. A living being&rsquo;s capacities for
sensory discrimination, feature detection, perceptual categorization,
motor memory are all involved with the repertoires of action that
being performs, either innately or through learning.</p>

<p>
At this point, let us take note of two things commonly said about
Hartley, both problematic. They appear together in the entry on
Hartley in the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>, 11th edition
(1911):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
With Locke he asserted that, prior to sensation, the human mind is a
blank. By a growth from simple sensations those states of
consciousness which appear most remote from sensation come into being.
And the one law of growth of which Hartley took account was the law of
contiguity, synchronous and successive. By this law he sought to
explain, not only the phenomena of memory &hellip; but also the
phenomena of emotion, of reasoning, and of voluntary and involuntary
action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, nowhere does Hartley say the mind is a blank slate (Locke has
&ldquo;white paper&rdquo;) at birth. His subject is the living,
embodied being, a member of the human community. As noted above, he
was a husband and the father of three; his book includes numerous
observations of children. A newborn infant does not have any snapshots
in its mental photo album, but experiences pleasure and discomfort,
wakes and sleeps, and is quick to seek the mother&rsquo;s nipple and
nurse. Within a few weeks the newborn can identify its mother by scent
and voice. To say an infant&rsquo;s &lsquo;mind&rsquo; is a blank
slate is to detach &lsquo;mind&rsquo; from body and body from
membership in a human community. Second, the comment about &ldquo;one
law of growth&rdquo; being &ldquo;the law of contiguity, synchronous
and successive&rdquo; derives from Coleridge&rsquo;s extended critique
of Hartley in his <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, chapters 6 and 7
(1817] 2014; see, e.g., Hayden 1984, 96). Coleridge&mdash;by then much
indebted to German philosophers, particularly Schelling&mdash;claims
that the &ldquo;one law of contiguity&rdquo; must govern all instances
of &ldquo;association,&rdquo; if synchronous or successive
&ldquo;vibrations&rdquo; are their material cause. The conclusion he
draws is that, in Hartley&rsquo;s theory, the &lsquo;mind&rsquo; would
be wholly passive: &ldquo;the consequence would have been, that our
whole life would be divided between the despotism of outward
impressions, and that of senseless and passive memory&rdquo; ([1817]
2014, 80). This is an instance of question begging. The unstated
assumption is that, if &ldquo;association&rdquo; depends upon
underlying neural events, the events must be
&ldquo;contiguous&rdquo;&mdash;&lsquo;near&rsquo; each other in space
or time. This is plainly false. The &ldquo;law of contiguity&rdquo; is
Coleridge&rsquo;s invention. A person can hear an unfamiliar bird call
one day, recognize it upon hearing it again two weeks later, and then
learn the identity of the species while walking with a birder friend.
The birds now become familiar, though never noticed before.</p>

<h2 id="RangActiAutoDeco">5. The Range of Actions: From &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo; to &ldquo;Decomplex&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
For many animals, the ways in which physical movements respond to
visual cues are relatively fixed: cats pounce on mice (some of cloth),
and swat at moths (or moving shadows on a sunlit wall). For human
beings, thanks to the brain&rsquo;s plasticity in forming &ldquo;joint
impressions,&rdquo; there are abundantly many ways in which the
&ldquo;varieties&rdquo; of one sensation &ldquo;vary with the
varieties&rdquo; of another: at the sight of notes on a staff, a
pianist&rsquo;s fingers move easily upon a piano keyboard. Expert
musicians, at the sight of the notes, hear the tune in the
mind&rsquo;s ear. But how to explain what it is that the expert
musician (or any expert practitioner) does? And how does one learn to
do this?</p>

<p>
In the <em>Observations</em>, Hartley offers a novel treatment of
physical action&mdash;a topic largely absent from other treatises, or
inquiries, devoted to &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; or &ldquo;human
understanding.&rdquo; Even in James Mill&rsquo;s <em>Analysis of the
Phenomena of the Human Mind</em>, a work with an acknowledged debt to
Hartley, bodily action is touched on only in the last chapter of the
book, on &ldquo;The Will.&rdquo; But to an attentive &ldquo;observer
of man,&rdquo; it should be obvious that we live by doing, by
performing tasks that depend on repertoires of perfected movement,
some mastered in infancy, others later in life.</p>

<p>
Hartley invented to two words to describe physical movements:
&ldquo;automatic&rdquo; and &ldquo;decomplex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
It appears that Hartley invented the adjective
&ldquo;automatic,&rdquo; deriving it from &ldquo;automaton,&rdquo; to
describe movements such as &ldquo;the motions of the heart, and the
peristaltic motion of the bowels&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, Introduction).
Such &ldquo;originally automatic&rdquo; motions are homeostatic: as a
heart beats, the alternation of contraction and relaxation is
maintained and modified in response to the needs and experiences of
the organism (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 19). Following the discussion of
&ldquo;originally automatic&rdquo; motion is this theorem: &ldquo;If
any sensation A, idea B, or motion C, be associated &hellip; with any
other sensation D, idea E, or muscular motion F, it will, at last,
excite d, the simple idea belonging to sensation D, the very idea E,
or the very muscular motion F&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 20). Any
sensation, idea, or muscular motion can be the stimulus that excites a
response in another idea or muscular motion. In some instances, the
stimulus elicits an unlearned reflex: at the sight of a snake, one
person&rsquo;s heart beats faster. In others, both stimulus and
response are contingent: at the sight of a snake, a second person
identifies the species and takes a photo. In some instances responses
are &ldquo;voluntary,&rdquo; and, often with repetition, become
&ldquo;secondarily automatic&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21).</p>

<p>
An action is voluntary when its stimulus is an &ldquo;idea, or state
of mind &hellip; which we term the will&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop.
21). (Note again how Hartley takes care to stay within the bounds of
the observable.) To illustrate how ideas of the form &ldquo;the will
to &hellip;&rdquo; derive from &ldquo;originally automatic&rdquo;
motions, Hartley describes how a child gains motor control over parts
and functions of her body. &ldquo;Originally automatic&rdquo; motions
are brought under control through a series of substitutions of the
initiating stimulus. An infant grasps the finger placed in her palm,
and then the toy she sees, and then grasps at &ldquo;the sound of the
words grasp, take hold, &amp;c., the sight of the nurse&rsquo;s hand,
in that state, the idea of a hand, and particularly the child&rsquo;s
own hand.&rdquo; These and &ldquo;innumerable other associated
circumstances &hellip; will put the child upon grasping, till, at
last, that idea, or state of mind which we may call the will to grasp,
is generated and sufficiently associated with the action to produce it
instantaneously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In Hartley&rsquo;s account, the performance of a voluntary movement is
not a dualistic, two-stage process, with an executive
&ldquo;faculty&rdquo;&mdash; Mind, or Will, isolated from
&ldquo;corporeal causes&rdquo; &mdash; issuing an instruction the body
then carries out. Rather, a movement <em>becomes</em> voluntary
through the living being&rsquo;s interaction with the
&ldquo;innumerable &hellip; associated circumstances&rdquo; of its
environment. In this light, &ldquo;will&rdquo; does not name anything
substantive: it is a word we use to describe an &ldquo;idea, or state
of mind.&rdquo; And it is a word parents often use to express
bafflement as to what this &ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; amounts to.
Hartley notes that adults start calling a child willful at the time he
learns to walk, because &ldquo;the child, in some cases, does not walk
when desired, whilst yet the circumstances are apparently the same as
when he does. For here the unapparent cause of walking, or not
walking, is <em>will</em>&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 77). But, he
adds, &ldquo;a careful observation &hellip; will always shew &hellip;
that when children do different things, the real circumstances,
natural or associated, are proportionally different, and that the
state of mind called will depends on the difference.&rdquo; One should
probably take this to be something the parents of young David, Mary,
and Winchcombe Hartley knew full well.</p>

<p>
Sequences of substitutions transform originally automatic actions into
voluntary ones. Hartley recognizes that the process continues, so that
voluntary actions become &ldquo;secondarily automatic&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
After the actions, which are most perfectly voluntary, have been
rendered so by one set of associations, they may, by another, be made
to depend upon the most diminutive sensations, ideas, and motions,
such as the mind scarce regards, or is conscious of; and which it can
therefore scarce recollect the moment after the action is over. Hence
it follows, that association not only converts automatic actions into
voluntary, but voluntary ones into automatic. For these actions
&hellip; are rather to be ascribed to the body than the mind, i.e. are
to be referred to the head of automatic motions. I shall call them
automatic motions of the secondary kind, to distinguish them from
those which are originally automatic, and from the voluntary ones.
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21)
</blockquote>

<p>
Think of learning to write with a pen or play the piano. At first one
develops a repertoire of voluntary motions. But fluency requires that
the motions be secondarily automatic.</p>

<p>
Most human competencies, when voluntarily performed, rely upon
extensive repertoires of secondarily automatic actions. Such
performances are what Hartley calls &ldquo;decomplex.&rdquo;
Contemporaneous readers of the <em>Observations</em> would have been
familiar with Locke&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;complex&rdquo; in his
<em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> (Locke [1690] 1975,
2.12.1). They would also be familiar with &ldquo;decompound&rdquo; and
&ldquo;decomposite&rdquo;&mdash;both from the late Latin
<em>decompositus</em>, a rendering of the Greek
<em>parasynthetos</em>&mdash;in which the &ldquo;de-&rdquo; prefix
signifies &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo; or &ldquo;further.&rdquo; On the
analogy of &ldquo;compound&rdquo; to &ldquo;decompound,&rdquo; Hartley
wrote of ideas and actions being either &ldquo;complex&rdquo; or
&ldquo;decomplex&rdquo;: the associations in a complex action or idea
are synchronic, while the associations in a decomplex action or idea
are diachronic, taking place over time. In playing a piano, hitting
the D key at the sight of the printed note D is a complex movement,
while playing a composition is a decomplex action. The elements of a
secondarily automatic movement are tightly fused. Those in a decomplex
action or idea are more loosely associated (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 12).
This looseness makes it possible to include a repertoire of
secondarily automatic movements in a variety of decomplex
ones&mdash;the same notes in an endless number of tunes, including
improvisations. Hartley also observes that people find it impossible
to perform decomplex actions&mdash;play a tune, say a
sentence&mdash;backward.</p>

<p>
Decomplex &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; draw on different kinds of complex
movements, involving the association of movements with perceptions in
one or more sensory modalities: at the sight of the notes on the
staff, or the sound of the tones, or a nod from another member of the
jazz quartet, the pianist hits the keys. Moreover, as a person becomes
proficient at a type of decomplex action, the guiding sensory modality
can change. When learning to dance, Hartley observes, at first
&ldquo;the scholar desires to look at his feet and legs, in order to
judge by seeing when they are in a proper position,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;by degrees he learns to judge of this by feeling&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 77). Similarly, a practiced musician plays the
harpsichord from &ldquo;the connexion of the several complex parts of
the decomplex motions&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 21). One&rsquo;s
hands know the tune.</p>

<p>
To his critics, notably Reid and the later Coleridge, Hartley&rsquo;s
commitment to &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; impeached the &ldquo;freedom of
the will&rdquo; and hence moral responsibility. But where such critics
were intent on affirming the adult self&rsquo;s executive control over
thought and action, Hartley&rsquo;s concern is the opposite: he starts
with the infant and asks, How does a child gain control of the
originally automatic processes present in infancy? Gain motor control
of her hands? Learn to walk, and dance? Play a musical instrument?
When singing, improvise a harmony line to another&rsquo;s melody?
Transform spontaneous burbling and crying into articulate speech?
Hartley&rsquo;s critics accuse him of reducing the human being to a
&ldquo;mere mechanism.&rdquo; But from a Hartleian perspective,
&ldquo;secondarily automatic&rdquo; and &ldquo;decomplex&rdquo;
actions are achievements, not givens&mdash;and necessary achievements,
if one is to live a complete human life.</p>

<p>
Hartley improvised with language in order to articulate a new
understanding of human action. Use of the one word became &hellip;
automatic. The other never made it into circulation. In a world in
which &ldquo;decompose&rdquo; means &ldquo;to rot,&rdquo; it was
doomed. Nonetheless, we lack a widely available word for the concept
that &ldquo;decomplex&rdquo; names. Hartley&rsquo;s account draws
particular attention to the dependency of our capacities for
intentionality, flexibility, and innovation in our decomplex actions
upon the repertoires of actions we have made secondarily automatic. It
thus centers upon a key insight: &ldquo;All our voluntary powers are
of the nature of memory&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 90).</p>

<h2 id="LangThou">6. Language and Thought</h2>

<p>
We enter the world at birth already humming with &ldquo;originally
automatic&rdquo; motions. Thanks to the activity of our brain and
nerves, these motions are self-regulating and homeostatic. Then, as we
grow, we gain voluntary control over some of our movements, perfect
those that become secondarily automatic, and learn to carry out
decomplex actions that draw on repertoires of secondarily automatic
components. Although the concept of the &ldquo;association of
ideas&rdquo; plays a central role in Hartley&rsquo;s account, the
paradigmatic instances of &ldquo;association&rdquo; are, first, the
&ldquo;joint impressions&rdquo; that generate &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;
(including complex movements), and second, the flowing cascades of
movement that are decomplex actions. Such decomplex actions are
central to the lives we lead. And foremost among decomplex actions are
the sentences we speak.</p>

<p>
For Hartley, language is a highly &ldquo;decomplex&rdquo; motor
activity that involves the cementing of associations between perceived
and created sounds, and, for the literate, perceived and created
marks: &ldquo;impressions made on the ear,&rdquo; &ldquo;actions of
the organs of speech,&rdquo; &ldquo;impressions made upon the
eye,&rdquo; and &ldquo;actions of the hand in writing&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 79). Further connections must be made between
perceived or created sounds and features of the world, especially the
actions of oneself and of other people. Hartley&rsquo;s approach is
nearly the opposite of Locke&rsquo;s, who writes as if language were a
dictionary, in which each word marks an idea known prelinguistically
to the speaker: &ldquo;words being voluntary signs, they cannot be
voluntary signs imposed by [the speaker] on things he knows
not&hellip; . Till he has some ideas of his own, he cannot suppose
them to correspond with the conceptions of another man; nor can he use
any signs for them&rdquo; (Locke [1690] 1975, 3.2.2).</p>

<p>
While Locke seems to be saying that individuals first have ideas and
then turn to language to communicate them to others, Hartley describes
a process whereby, as children, we burble and cry and listen&mdash;and
gradually gain motor control of our burbling and crying, associate it
with what we hear and handle and do, and eventually utter
&ldquo;sentences&rdquo; that, though sometimes short
(<em>Mommy!</em>), are whole, complete, and meaningful. The meaning is
a property of the whole&mdash;of the performance of a specific
decomplex action in a social and pragmatic context. Once again, the
process of association&mdash;here the activity of hearing and
speaking, and later reading and writing&mdash;generates ideas: we have
ideas because we use language, in concrete social interactions; we do
not create language to express the ideas we, as lone individuals,
already have.</p>

<p>
In this regard, consider Hume&rsquo;s assertion that, if we are unsure
about the meaning of a word, &ldquo;we need but enquire, <em>from what
impression is that supposed idea derived?</em>&rdquo; (Hume [1748]
1975, 22), and his recommendation that we abandon words that lack such
derivations. If taken seriously, and not as a bit of fun on
Hume&rsquo;s part, from Hartley&rsquo;s point of view this would be
manifestly bad advice. For Hartley, complex and decomplex ideas are
wholes that do not &ldquo;bear any relation to [their] compounding
parts.&rdquo; Specifically, &ldquo;the decomplex idea belonging to any
sentence is not compounded merely of the complex ideas belonging to
the words in it&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 12). Moreover,
&ldquo;both children and adults learn the ideas belonging to whole
sentences many times in a summary way, and not by adding together the
ideas of the several words in the sentence.&rdquo; Consequently,
children and illiterate adults find it hard to &ldquo;separate
sentences into the several words which compound them&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 80). Thus the meanings of sentences are not
simply derivable from the meanings of the words in them, and the
meanings of those words are not derivable from the
&ldquo;impressions&rdquo; to which they refer. It is only when people
learn to read that they realize sentences are composed of individual
words. Over time, the sentences increase in decomplexity, as people
participate in the varied activities of life. As adults, people speak
a vast variety of highly decomplex expressions&mdash;including, for
example, those involved in the practice of a science, or a
religion.</p>

<h2 id="LangAlge">7. Language as Algebra</h2>

<p>
Given that meaning is a property of complete expressions, Hartley is
quick to point out that individual words often lack definite, shared
meanings. Such indefiniteness is, in Hartley&rsquo;s view, hardly a
defect, but rather a valuable feature of language. Hartley writes that
language is &ldquo;one species of algebra,&rdquo; and algebra
&ldquo;nothing more than the language &hellip; peculiarly fitted to
explain quantity of all kinds&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, 80).</p>

<p>
The algebraic quality of language is especially important in
scientific practice. Like <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in algebra,
scientific terms, such as Hartley&rsquo;s &ldquo;vibrations&rdquo; or
contemporary physicists&rsquo; &ldquo;particles&rdquo; stand for
unknowns, for which vibrating strings or grains of sand provide only
misleading analogies. Their presence is necessary for the practice of
scientific discovery. Scientists employ &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo; terms
in order to discern correlations and patterns that might otherwise
remain unobserved: &ldquo;Bringing an unknown quantity into a relation
answers, in philosophy, to the art of giving names, expressing nothing
definite &hellip; and then inserting these names &hellip; in all the
enunciations of the phenomena, to see whether, from a comparison of
these terms with each other, something definite in manner, degree, or
mutual relation might result&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87). In such
scientific practice, the more algebraic&mdash;i.e., free from
association with sense &ldquo;impressions&rdquo;&mdash;words are the
better. (Thus &ldquo;quark&rdquo; is an inspired choice.) Hume&rsquo;s
advice, to use only terms referring to clear
&ldquo;impressions,&rdquo; if followed, would bring the practice of a
science to a halt.</p>

<p>
However, to turn this around, the utility of words for unknowns
depends upon their proper use within ongoing practices. For examples
of how to conduct scientific inquiry, Hartley turns to mathematical
methods, and he includes an extensive discussion of these in
proposition 87 of volume 1 of the <em>Observations</em>, which is
titled: &ldquo;To deduce Rules for the Ascertainment of Truth, and
Advancement of Knowledge, from the Mathematical Methods of considering
Quantity.&rdquo; One deduction involves the comparison of scientific
investigation to the use of the rule of the false position in
arithmetic: &ldquo;Here a first position is obtained, which, though
not accurate, approaches, however, to the truth. From this, applied to
the equations, a second position is deduced, which approaches nearer
to the truth than the first; from the second a third, etc.&rdquo;
Hartley adds that &ldquo;this is indeed the way, in which advances in
science are carried on; and scientific persons are aware, that it is
and must be so&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I frame no hypotheses.&rdquo; Thus had Newton famously written
in the <em>Principia.</em> Hartley responds directly: &ldquo;It is in
vain,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;to bid an inquirer form no
hypothesis&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 87). Remember that Hartley was
a practicing physician; on the basis of ambiguous symptoms and
fallible medical knowledge, he was every day &ldquo;framing
hypotheses,&rdquo; making diagnoses. The question, for Hartley,
concerns the degree of confidence we may place in our hypotheses. How
do we measure how far our &ldquo;first position&rdquo; is from the
truth, when we don&rsquo;t know what the truth is? And how do we
measure the degree to which the degree of error in our second and
third positions has diminished?</p>

<p>
In this regard, what is most interesting in proposition 87 is
Hartley&rsquo;s discussion of probability. Hartley appears to have
been one of a small circle of mathematicians who read, and understood,
papers making fundamental contributions to the theory of probability
by Abraham De Moivre (1667&ndash;1754) and Thomas Bayes
(1702&ndash;61). De Moivre developed a theorem that allows for the
determination of the degree of convergence between the frequency of
observed events and the underlying probability ratio, for any finite
number of events. More important is &ldquo;the solution to the inverse
problem,&rdquo; which Hartley says &ldquo;an ingenious friend&rdquo;
communicated to him. This would be Bayes&rsquo;s
theorem&mdash;customarily attributed to Thomas Bayes (but see Stigler
1983)&mdash;which deals with determining the probability with which
probability ratios can be inferred from observed outcomes, and which
provides (a still controversial) foundation for statistical inference.
In his discussion of probability theory, and other mathematical
topics, Hartley is primarily interested in methods for moving from
observation to explanation, of assessing the likeliness&mdash;i.e,
believability&mdash;of hypotheses. Something that physicians, like
Hartley, regularly must do when offering a diagnosis.</p>

<p>
Hartley, like Hume, thought that belief was largely a matter of
sentiment. &ldquo;Rational assent&rdquo; is a matter of the strength
of the association between a sentence (or even some of the words in
it!) and the word &ldquo;true&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 86)
&ldquo;Practical assent,&rdquo; a person&rsquo;s willingness to act,
depends on the vividness the proposition&mdash;and such can even make
&ldquo;an interesting event, supposed doubtful, or even fictitious,
&hellip; appear like a real one,&rdquo; thereby pulling rational
assent after it. (Hartley notes, dryly, &ldquo;the foundation of
assent is still the same. I here describe the fact only.&rdquo;) But
Hartley was not content to stop here, an exponent of an urbane
skepticism. Belief and assent are matters of feeling, of sentiment,
yes&mdash;but there are mathematical ways of thinking about the
probabilities of belief. And people who think mathematically make
better physicians and scientists. How many trials of an unproven
treatment for bladder stones does one have to run, to reach a
threshold degree of belief in the results? The answer depends on
one&rsquo;s &ldquo;priors.&rdquo; In this regard, it is fair to say
that Hartley was one of the first Bayesians.</p>

<p>
As discussed in section 3 above, another consequence of
Hartley&rsquo;s practice-oriented, &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo; approach to
language concerns the validity of alternate languages. In the
&ldquo;popular&rdquo; language we use every day, we talk of our
choices, intentions, and resolutions, but in the
&ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; language of the <em>Observations</em>,
Hartley proposed we think in terms of &ldquo;philosophical
necessity&rdquo;&mdash;in which every &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; action
is &ldquo;excited by an associated circumstance&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1,
70). Some people had, and have, no use for such talk: it denies the
freedom (and indeed, the existence) of the &ldquo;will.&rdquo; Hartley
argues that the use of two incommensurable languages,
&ldquo;popular&rdquo; and &ldquo;philosophical,&rdquo; is not a
problem, provided that we use them separately and consistently:
&ldquo;insuperable difficulties will arise&rdquo; only &ldquo;if we
mix these languages&rdquo; (OM 2, prop. 15). Both languages work in
their own contexts of practice.</p>

<p>
Hartley had a warrant for this affirmative approach to languages in
his scientific and mathematical training: Newton wrote the
<em>Principia</em> in the language of geometry, but the
&ldquo;mathematical principles of natural philosophy&rdquo; could be
equally (and better?) expressed in the &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo;
language of the calculus&mdash;for which there were rival notations.
Similarly, Hartley championed a new &ldquo;notation&rdquo; for the
English language&mdash;his friend John Byrom&rsquo;s shorthand, which
he saw as a reform that would make our written language more closely
approximate a &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; one. When he began work on
the <em>Observations</em>, he conceived of the project as
demonstrating that language about &ldquo;self-interest,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;common good,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;will of God&rdquo; were
different ways of saying the same thing. The project was thus as much
moral and religious as it was scientific.</p>

<h2 id="MoraPsyc">8. Moral Psychology</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;The great business and purport of the present life is the
transformation of sensuality into spirituality&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 2,
prop. 50). We encountered this, second theme, in section 2 above. In
section 3, we also noted that Hartley mentions the &ldquo;Hints&rdquo;
Newton left behind, &ldquo;to be examined and improv&rsquo;d by the
farther Experiments and Observations. &hellip; And if Natural
Philosophy shall at length be perfected, the bounds of Moral
Philosophy will also be enlarged&rdquo; ([Newton 1717] 1730). Hartley
sought just this enlargement through an account of the transformation,
through the association of ideas, of sensuality into spirituality.</p>

<p>
In section 3 we also noted that, following a hint in Query 31, some
followers of Newton imagined a &ldquo;nut-shell&rdquo; universe
(Priestley 1777a, 17), in which infinitesimal atoms of matter are
carried within an immaterial medium bearing forces of attraction and
repulsion. Working from a chemical theory based on such forces,
Hartley and Stephen Hales sought to dissolve bladder stones <em>in
situ</em> by releasing the force of repulsion locked within them.
Hartley extends the chemical concept to psychology. As an analogy to
the forces of &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;repulsion,&rdquo; he
writes of both &ldquo;associations&rdquo; and
&ldquo;counter-associations&rdquo; at work in generating the frame, or
basic orientations, of a person&rsquo;s self. The role of association
is obvious; &ldquo;counter-associations&rdquo; are equally vital.
Those in our dreams, for example, are &ldquo;of singular use to us, by
interrupting and breaking the course of our associations. For, if we
were always awake, some accidental associations would be cemented by
continuance, as that nothing could afterwards disjoin them, which
would be madness&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 91). A sane mind,
therefore, is one &ldquo;maintained in a continual round of the
production and dissolution&rdquo; (Hales 1769,
1:314&ndash;15)&mdash;in, that is, a dynamic balance of connection and
detachment, memory and forgetting, that holds out the possibility of
change and transformation.</p>

<p>
We noted in the discussion of action in section 4 that, in
Hartley&rsquo;s theory, children gain voluntary control over their
bodies through a series of substitutions. A similar series of
substitutions, or &ldquo;transferences&rdquo; of emotion, are at work
in the formation of a person&rsquo;s character. For example, Hartley
offers a fascinating, detailed account of how the spontaneous gesture
by which a frightened, abused child raises his hand to ward off a blow
becomes, through a series of transferences, the blow the abusing adult
directs in anger at a helpless child (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 97; one
wonders about the source of this observation). Here, the links by
which fear is transferred, and transmuted into anger, include the
situational, symbolic, and semantic: from, for example, being struck
to the &ldquo;signs and tokens&rdquo; of an impending
beating&mdash;e.g., the bottle of gin, or the words of abuse and
affection, the curses and kisses, that attend drunkenness. One can
also see that, for the child-grown-adult, freedom from the bondage of
abusive behavior and self-loathing would require a therapy for
breaking &ldquo;associations cemented by
continuance&rdquo;&mdash;William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;mind-forged
manacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Hartley&rsquo;s model of psychological development is based on seven
classes of &ldquo;pleasures and pains&rdquo;&mdash;the only subject
treated twice in the <em>Observations,</em> in part 1, chapter 4 and
part 2, chapter 3 (&ldquo;The Rule of Life&rdquo;). Sensation is the
first of these. Hitting one&rsquo;s thumb with a hammer is painful.
However, even at this base level experiences of pleasure and pain
derive a coloring from their &ldquo;associated
circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;who you are with, and why and where, and
memories of times before, and the meaning you give to the activity. It
is worth a sore thumb for the sake of being on a team building a house
for Habitat for Humanity. Thus extending beyond Sensation are six
classes of &ldquo;intellectual pleasures and pains,&rdquo;
Imagination, Ambition, Self-interest, Sympathy, Theopathy, and the
Moral Sense. We should think of these as a person&rsquo;s orientations
toward the world and especially other people, and also as traits of
character&mdash;otherwise called dispositions, habits,
<em>hexeis.</em></p>

<ol>

<li>Imagination, where pleasure and displeasure derive from
perceptions of, representations of, and interactions with
&lsquo;objects&rsquo; of all kinds.</li>

<li>Ambition, where pleasure or pain derive from one&rsquo;s desire
for recognition and awareness of being an object of others&rsquo;
attention and assessment.</li>

<li>Self-interest, in three forms, with &ldquo;gross&rdquo; managing
the demands of Imagination and Ambition, &ldquo;refined&rdquo; linked
to Sympathy, and &ldquo;rational&rdquo; to Theopathy. It represents
the potential pivot from egoism to altruism.</li>

<li>Sympathy (inclusive of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;empathy&rdquo;), where
pleasure and pain derive from concern for the wellbeing of
others.</li>

<li>Theopathy (apparently Hartley&rsquo;s invention), which consists
of feelings deriving from the person&rsquo;s ideas of
&lsquo;God&rsquo; or &lsquo;the gods&rsquo;, including one&rsquo;s
sense of being an object of God&rsquo;s attention, care or
indifference, approval or disapproval.</li>

<li>The Moral Sense, the &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; of Sympathy and
Theopathy, and a person&rsquo;s conscience and capacity for moral
judgment.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The six classes are capacious and expansive. For Imagination, picture
a young child fascinated with the life in ponds and rockpools; then,
as a student in school or university, awed by the vastness of life and
dedicated to its study; then, as a biologist, absorbed in a career of
research and writing. For Ambition, picture the child&rsquo;s pleasure
at receiving praise and encouragement for being able to name the
rockpool&rsquo;s forms of life; the student&rsquo;s anxiety at taking
a test, pleasure at doing well, and distress at not doing well enough;
the biologist&rsquo;s desire for recognition and the signs
thereof.</p>

<p>
The dynamic the six groups represent is epigenetic and transformative.
A young child takes pleasure in looking at the life in pond and
rockpool. With time, when studying a newly acquired Big Book of Pond
Life matters more than looking at another pond, the pleasures of
Imagination are now on the way to defining the child&rsquo;s
&ldquo;primary pursuit.&rdquo; The pleasures of Sensation thus
&ldquo;model&rdquo; those of Imagination, and those of Imagination
recursively &ldquo;new model&rdquo; those of Sensation. Put simply,
the more one knows about pond life, the more one is able to see in a
pond. Thus we should take &ldquo;model&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;form by
giving substance to&rdquo; and &ldquo;new-model&rdquo; as
&ldquo;re-form by gaining a larger perspective through
contextualization.&rdquo; According to Koschorke, &ldquo;Hartley turns
the physiology of the senses into a kind of exercise in cybernetics
<em>avant la lettre.</em> Increasing complexity generates entirely new
qualities of mind. &hellip; [I]t is also feasible to encourage the
process of association even further in order to widen the distance
between the intellectual ideas and simple sensations. &hellip; This is
due to the fact that the enhanced association of ideas contributes
&hellip; to the spiritualization of ideas. &hellip; This is nothing
less than an early model of entropy&rdquo; (Koschorke 1999, 117).</p>

<p>
As they are modeled in each person, the six can be well-formed or
disfigured. Imagination can lead to expertise and skill in the
practice of a discipline. It can also lead a person down into a narrow
and isolating obsession. Ambition&rsquo;s desire for respect and
recognition is healthy&mdash;when new-modeled by Sympathy&mdash;since
it contributes to self-awareness and moderation in one&rsquo;s
engagement with others. But if it becomes one&rsquo;s primary pursuit,
the effect is destructive. Hartley may have had in mind some fellow
members of the Royal Society when he wrote that &ldquo;the study of
science, without a view to God and our duty, and from a vain desire
for applause, will get possession of our hearts, &hellip; Nothing can
easily exceed the vain glory, self-conceit, arrogance, emulation, and
envy, that are found in the eminent professors of the sciences,
mathematics, natural philosophy, and even divinity itself&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 60). Similarly, Theopathy may be only
rudimentarily developed. In discussing the &ldquo;associations [that]
may be observed in fact to be heaped upon&rdquo; the word
&lsquo;God&rsquo;, Hartley observes that these begin with the
&ldquo;compound fictitious idea&rdquo; children form when they
&ldquo;suppose [God] to stand for a man whom they have never
seen&rdquo; and that they end &hellip; when this idea &ldquo;is quite
obliterated, without anything of a stable precise nature succeeding in
its room&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 98). He is especially conscious
of the dangers facing those whose primary pursuit concerns being
sympathetic, theopathic, and morally perceptive&mdash;or being thought
so. Sympathy and Theopathy can be dark. Some take pleasure in the
suffering of others. A person in imagining himself filled to the brim
with Theopathy can become &ldquo;a bitter persecuting spirit&rdquo;
(<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 97), a practitioner of &ldquo;disinterested
cruelty and malice.&rdquo; Reading Hartley one encounters a vision of
human nature in which, if we observe ourselves, we find not a unitary
self but a community of passions, sometimes harmonious, at other times
at odds.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We do, and must, upon our entrance into the world, begin with
idolatry to external things, and, as we advance in it, proceed to the
idolatry of ourselves&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 2, prop. 4). Some thus
remain, anxiously pouring their sacrifices over these concretions. In
others the inevitable counter-associations act as solvents and cause
the stony idols to disintegrate. Sympathy and Theopathy replace, and
temper, Imagination and Ambition as &ldquo;primary pursuits.&rdquo;
Hartley calls this reorienting transformation the &ldquo;annihilation
of self.&rdquo; It is a reorientation toward, or discovery of, a
higher self of sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense. It involves
what Koschorke calls &ldquo;the spiritualization of
ideas&rdquo;&mdash;liberation from the &ldquo;mind-forged
manacles&rdquo; of a self-created and self-regarding tyranny and an
awakening to one&rsquo;s true, and expansive, humanity.</p>

<p>
To one imprisoned in a life led for self alone, a greater life is
incomprehensible, even contemptible. &ldquo;The human
individual&rdquo; Basil Willey writes, &ldquo;may be regarded as a
sort of refinery in which the loftiest spirituality is being
mechanically distilled out of sense. But only, of course, as long as
our days are indeed bound each to each by natural piety: only as long
as our minds are in what Wordsworth has called &lsquo;a healthy state
of association&rsquo;. &hellip; The development may be deflected or
arrested, and the child may be father of a monster instead of a
man&rdquo; (Willey 1941, 144). Still, Hartley developed his psychology
to show that no one is forever a disfigured monstrosity, condemned to
hell, whether metaphysical or psychological. The persistent conflicts
the six classes generate possess a telos, push a person onward:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And thus we may perceive, that all the pleasures and pains of
sensation, imagination, ambition, self-interest, sympathy, and
theopathy, as far as they are consistent with one another, with the
frame of our natures, and with the course of the world, beget in us a
moral sense, and lead us to the love and approbation of virtue, and
the fear, hatred, and abhorrence of vice. This moral sense therefore
carries its own authority with it, inasmuch as it is the sum total of
all the rest, and the ultimate result from them; and employs the force
and authority of the whole nature of man against any particular part
of it, that rebels against the determinations and commands of the
conscience or moral judgment. (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 94)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the end, Hartley is profoundly optimistic about the ultimate future
of human beings: association &ldquo;has a tendency to reduce the state
of those who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
back again to a paradisiacal one&rdquo; (<em>OM</em> 1, prop. 14, cor.
9). He imagines people progressing into that state:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A]ll would become &hellip; new senses, and perceptive powers, to each
other, so as to increase each other&rsquo;s happiness without limits;
they would all become <em>members of the mystical body of Christ;</em>
all would have an equal care for each other; all increase in love, and
come to their <em>full stature</em>, to perfect manhood, <em>by that
which every joint supplieth:</em> happiness would circulate through
this mystical body without end, so as that each particle would, in due
time, arrive at each individual point, or sentient being, of the great
whole, that each would <em>inheret all things.</em> (<em>OM</em> 2,
prop. 68; cf. Ephesians 4.16).</p>

<h2 id="Bib">Bibliography</h2>

<h3 id="PrimLite">Primary Literature</h3>

<p>
Listed are the two most commonly available editions of the
<em>Observations on Man</em>, both of which have been reprinted in
paperback and are available online. Because the text of all editions
is the same, citations are to volume and proposition, rather than to
page. Users of the one-volume 1791 edition should note that the
propositions are numbered consecutively throughout. The 1749 edition
has 99 propositions in volume 1; proposition 1 in volume 2 of that
edition is proposition 100 in the 1791 edition. Readers referring to
the 1775 abridgment should note that the propositions included in that
volume are numbered consecutively in that volume, and hence do not
correspond to the other editions.</p>
