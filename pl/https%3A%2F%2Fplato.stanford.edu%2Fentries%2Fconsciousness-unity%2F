<h1>The Unity of Consciousness</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Mar 27, 2001; substantive revision Mon Apr 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Mary is patiently waiting behind the red light in her car. The light
has been extended to allow for the long line of protesters that are
crossing to clear the intersection. She runs her fingers around the
steering wheel, finding its warmth pleasing. Goodnight Irene is
playing on the radio. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good day&rdquo;, she thinks.
Mary is experiencing a wide range of conscious states, including
visual experiences, auditory experiences, tactile experiences,
thoughts, and emotions. Despite their differences, however, there is
an intuitive and multi-faceted sense in which Mary is enjoying a
unified consciousness. Mary&rsquo;s experiences seem to be parts of a
unified whole. They are not separate and isolated from each other.
Their contents can be accessed together, integrated together, and
self-ascribed by the same subject. Moreover, their relation is such
that it allows conscious presentations of unified objects and a single
space in which Mary and these objects are located. Unity of
consciousness has been taken to signify one or several of these ways
in which conscious experiences are typically related to each other at
each moment or during uninterrupted streams of consciousness. The
topic has been a persistent subject of philosophical enquiry for an
extended period that extends at least to the early modern era. After
briefly reviewing its history in Western philosophy and distinguishing
between various concepts of unity of consciousness, this entry focuses
on contemporary analytic discussions of the phenomenal unity of
consciousness.</p>

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="BriHis">1.1 A Brief History</h3>

<p>
The unity of consciousness was a main concern of Western philosophers
in what is often called the &lsquo;classical modern era&rsquo;
(roughly, 1600 to 1900), including Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Hume,
Reid, Brentano, and
 James.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Descartes employs the idea in one of his arguments for mind-body
dualism, beginning with the assertion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuch as I am only
a thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts, but
apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire. [Descartes 1641:
196]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To this, Descartes adds that if the mind is not made of parts, it
cannot be made of matter because anything material has parts.
Descartes thus infers the immateriality of the mind from one sense of
its unity: the idea that the mind is indivisible and has no parts.</p>

<p>
Unity of consciousness also figures prominently in the work of
Leibniz, Hume, and Reid. The idea and the indivisibility that
Descartes took to be required for it, seem to have served as
Leibniz&rsquo;s model of a monad, the building block of all reality
(see the entry on
 <a href="../leibniz-mind/">Leibniz&rsquo;s philosophy of mind</a>).
 With Hume, things are more complicated. It should have followed from
his atomism that there is no unified consciousness, just &ldquo;a
bundle of different perceptions&rdquo; (Hume 1739 [1962, 252]). Yet,
in a famous appendix, he says that there is something he cannot render
consistent with his atomism (Hume 1739 [1962, 636]). He never tells us
what it is, but it may have been that consciousness strongly appears
to be more than a bundle of independent &lsquo;perceptions&rsquo;.
Reid also made extensive use of the unity of consciousness, among
other things to run Descartes&rsquo; argument from unity to
indivisibility the other way around (Reid 1785).</p>

<p>
Kant rejects Descartes&rsquo;s argument, but the notion of the unity
of consciousness is central to his &lsquo;transcendental deduction of
the categories&rsquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../kant-mind/">Kant&rsquo;s view of the mind and consciousness of self</a>
 for a fuller treatment). There, Kant seems to claim that to tie
various experiences together into a single unified consciousness of
the world, we must be able to apply the concepts of fundamental
categories to them and this proves the legitimacy of the categories.
Kant&rsquo;s attempt to link the unity of consciousness to the
structure of knowledge continues to capture the imaginations of
contemporary
 philosophers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Brentano (1874 [1973]) argues that all the conscious states of a
person at a time will and perhaps must be unified with one another.
Arguably, this thesis is the predecessor of the contemporary Unity
Thesis, according to which, necessarily all the phenomenally conscious
states of a subject at a time are unified with one another. Brentano
combined this thesis with another strong thesis that all mental states
are conscious.</p>

<p>
Finally, late in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, James developed a
detailed treatment of synchronic (or &lsquo;at a time&rsquo;) unity of
consciousness. We will discuss his view later (see also entries on
 <a href="../hume/">David Hume</a>,
 <a href="../reid/">Thomas Reid</a>,
 <a href="../brentano/">Franz Brentano</a>,
 and
 <a href="../james/">William James</a>).</p>
 
<p>
With the prominence of logical atomism in philosophy and behaviorism
in psychology, the unity of consciousness almost disappeared from
research agendas early in the 20<sup>th</sup>
 century.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Logical atomists focused on the atomic elements of cognition (sense
data, simple propositional judgments, protocol sentences, etc.),
rather than on how these elements are tied together to form a mind.
Behaviorists urged that the mind is either a myth or at least
something that we cannot and do not need to study in a science of the
human person.</p>

<p>
After decades of neglect, the last third of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century saw a resurgence of interest in unified consciousness among
analytic philosophers. It began with influential commentaries on Kant
in the 1960s (Strawson 1966; Bennett 1966, 1974), as well as
discussions by Nagel and Parfit on its relation to personal identity
(Nagel 1971; Parfit 1971, 1984). Towards the end of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, a number of philosophers and a few
psychologists wrote on the subject, including Marks (1981), Trevarthen
(1984), Lockwood 1989, 1994), Hill (1991), Brook (1994), Marcel
(1994), Hurley (1994, 1998), and Shoemaker (1996). Unity of
consciousness remains a very active area of research. The first two
decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century have seen many articles,
volumes, and several monographs on the
 topic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 A good portion of this contemporary revival focuses on the proper
metaphysical analysis of unity, the correct way to understand
disorders of unity, and the relationship between unity and personal
identity. But there is also a recent revival of interest in the
Cartesian argument for dualism that draws on the unity of
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Unity of consciousness has thus been one of the central notions in
philosophy of mind for a rather long period. However, the study of
historical texts on the topic and their relationship to contemporary
debates is somewhat complicated by the fact that &ldquo;unity of
consciousness&rdquo; signifies several different concepts. In what
follows, we start by explaining some of these concepts and commenting
on their relationship. After that, this entry focuses on the
phenomenal unity of consciousness, a concept that has been at the
center-stage of recent work on unity of consciousness.</p>

<h3 id="ConUniCon">1.2 Concepts of Unity of Consciousness</h3>

<p>
Several concepts of unity of consciousness have figured in
contemporary analytic discussion. The list is long and the exact way
to characterize the concepts is itself a substantive topic. Here is a
rough characterization of some of
 them:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="jfy">

<li>Phenomenal unity: Two conscious states are phenomenally unified
when there is something it is like for the subject to be in both
conscious states simultaneously. For example, there is something that
it is like for Mary to see the line of protesters as she hears
Goodnight Irene.</li>

<li>Access unity: Conscious states are access unified when their
contents are accessible to the same consuming systems. For example,
Mary can verbally report both what she sees and what she hears or use
both in reasoning.</li>

<li>Representational unity: Conscious states are representationally
unified when their contents are integrated together. Mary can report
what she sees and what she hears. But it does not seem that when she
does so, she does it by first reporting what she sees, then what she
hears and then inferring what she hears and sees. What she sees and
what she hears are integrated in a manner that gives their conjunction
the same form of non-inferential access that she has to what she sees
(or what she hears).</li>

<li>Unity as Singularity: A consciousness state is unified in this
sense when it lacks other conscious states as parts. Perhaps, and this
is controversial, Mary&rsquo;s conscious experiences form a unified
whole, but this unified whole does not have these conscious
experiences (or any other experiences, for that matter) as parts.</li>

<li>Mereological unity: Conscious states are mereologically unified
when they are parts of a single conscious state. Perhaps, and this is
controversial, Mary&rsquo;s conscious experiences are parts of a
single unified whole.</li>

<li>Subject unity: Conscious states are subject-unified when they
belong to the same subject.</li>

<li>Unity of self-consciousness: Consciousness of oneself as the
single subject of a multiplicity of conscious states.</li>

<li>Objectual unity: Conscious states are objectually unified when
they present qualities or parts as qualities or parts of the same
 object.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 For example, Mary&rsquo;s visual experience presents, the shape,
color and motion of the car in front of her as the shape, color and
the motion of the same object. Or she hears the succession of musical
notes that form Goodnight Irene as belonging to the same object (a
single song in this case).</li>

<li>Spatial unity: Conscious states are spatially unified when they
present their objects as located within the same space. For example,
Mary experiences the steering wheel that she touches as located in the
same single space as the people who she sees crossing the street. In
general, in so far as her experiences have spatial content, they
present objects as located in the same
 space.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>Attentional unity: Conscious states are attentionally unified when
they compete for attentional resources. For example, there is an
intuitive sense in which Mary&rsquo;s attending to what she sees will
take her attention away from what she hears.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list is not exhaustive. For example, there are several other
subject-related senses of unity, including introspective unity (the
relation among conscious states in virtue of which they can be the
objects of a single act of introspection), self-ascriptive unity (the
relation among conscious states in virtue of which they can be
self-ascribed by the same subject), and narrative unity (the relation
among conscious states that are integrated around goals that a subject
attributes to herself).</p>

<p>
On the face of it, these senses of the unity of consciousness are
distinct from each other, but there could be substantive relations
between them. A proper treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of
this entry. So we will only mention a few examples.
Representationalists often reduce phenomenal unity to representational
unity, while mereological accounts offer to analyze phenomenal unity
in mereological terms. Also, it has been argued that some specific
forms of unity such as spatial unity, and attentional unity are
determinate forms of phenomenal unity. (See Hill 2018.) There could
also be explanatory or evidential relations between these forms of
unity. Access unity, for example, is sometimes offered as grounded in,
and therefore explained by, phenomenal unity and its absence is taken
as evidence for the absence of phenomenal unity. We will discuss some
of these relations in the following sections.</p>

<p>
The distinction between the above concepts of unity is important for
interpreting historical texts and assessing their continuity with
contemporary discussions of unity of consciousness. Unity as
singularity seems to be the notion of unity that Descartes relies on
in his argument against materialism, while subject-related notions of
unity, as well as objectual unity, spatial unity, and temporal unity
figure prominently in Kant and philosophical work in the Kantian
tradition. For example, the notions of objectual unity and
representational unity correspond closely to two kinds of synthesis
distinguished by Kant. Spatial and temporal unity are in the
background of Kant&rsquo;s discussion of the forms of sensibility in
the Aesthetics, and arguably unity of self-consciousness and
self-ascriptive unity figure in Kant&rsquo;s Transcendental Deduction
of the
 categories.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Attributing views about phenomenal unity, one of the senses of unity
that has been central in contemporary discussion, to these historical
figures is not a straightforward exegetical matter.</p>

<h3 id="PheUni">1.3 Phenomenal Unity</h3>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s revisit the vignette that we started this entry with. Mary
is waiting behind the red light in her car. She runs her fingers
around the steering wheel, finding its warmth pleasing. Goodnight
Irene is playing on the radio. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good day&rdquo;,
she thinks. Mary is having a multiplicity of different conscious
states. Many of these states, perhaps even all of them, are
phenomenally conscious. There is something that it is like for Mary to
have each of them. But there is also something it is like for her to
have all of these experiences at once&mdash;an extra element that goes
beyond the sum of what it is like to have each experience
individually. There is a phenomenal sense in which her experiences
form a unified whole. To put this succinctly, Mary&rsquo;s experiences
are <em>phenomenally unified.</em></p>

<p>
As a working characterization, synchronic phenomenal unity is the type
of relation between synchronous experiences that is illustrated in our
vignette and has two characteristics. First, it is a relation that is
<em>phenomenally manifest</em> in that it figures in the
characterization of what it is like to be a subject at a moment, and
second, it is <em>singularizing</em> in that when this relation
obtains between a set of experiences the experiences together form a
single phenomenal whole.</p>

<p>
We call this a working characterization partly because it already
borders on philosophical controversy. Some theorists reject the idea
that phenomenal unity is a relation among experiences. On such views,
a phenomenally unified consciousness contains only one experience and
therefore phenomenal unity is not a relation among experiences. It can
be, however, a relation among other items that have an intimate
connection to experiences.</p>

<p>
As noted earlier, our focus will be on recent analytic work on
phenomenal unity of consciousness, which we will simply refer to as
unity, unless otherwise indicated. There are multiple reasons for
focusing on phenomenal unity. First, the phenomenal notion of
consciousness has taken the center stage in consciousness studies.
Relatedly, of the various senses of unity, phenomenal unity has
received the lion&rsquo;s share of attention in recent
 work.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Our focus on phenomenal unity partly reflects this trend. Second,
although phenomenal unity is one concept among several other concepts
of unity of consciousness, some of these concepts get their
significance partly due to their connection to phenomenal unity. To
see this, consider a zombie duplicate of Mary. There is a coherent
sense in which notions such as subjective unity, access unity, and
representational unity, can be applied to a Mary&rsquo;s zombie
duplicate. And admittedly, there are important explanatory projects
that such notions can figure in. But there is an intuitive sense in
which, in the absence of their connection to phenomenal consciousness
and phenomenal unity, such notions lose some of their philosophical
thickness. We thus think that phenomenal unity plays a central role in
the diverse group of concepts of unity of consciousness. Admittedly,
this is a substantive philosophical thesis that requires careful
defense, a defense that we do not have room to provide here.</p>

<p>
The bulk of the entry is devoted to synchronic phenomenal unity, the
phenomenal unity of experiences had during the same interval of time.
We will discuss two broad topics: the metaphysics of synchronic unity
and disorders of unity. In the section on the metaphysics of unity we
will focus on some interrelated questions about the nature of unity.
The section on disorders of unity focuses on the contemporary debate
over unity in split-brain subjects and a few other disorders. We will
review several positions about the structure of consciousness in these
conditions.</p>

<p>
Synchronic phenomenal unity is not the only form of phenomenal unity.
There is also diachronic phenomenal unity: a phenomenally manifest and
singularizing relation among experiences that extends across time. The
entry concludes with a brief discussion of diachronic unity and its
relation to personal identity.</p>

<h2 id="MetUni">2. The Metaphysics of Unity</h2>

<p>
Is unity a primitive relation or can it be analyzed in more
fundamental terms? If unity can be analyzed in more fundamental terms,
what is the proper analysis of unity? Does a unified complex
experience have experiences as parts? Is unity part of the nature of
consciousness? These questions have been at the center of the
contemporary discussion over the metaphysics of unity. This section
briefly reviews some of this discussion.</p>

<h3 id="NatUni">2.1 The Nature of Unity</h3>

<p>
How should we analyze unity? Different answers to this question have
been offered in recent literature. But before reviewing these answers,
we should note some divergence in formulations. Some pose the question
in terms of an analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions for
the unity relation. Generically, such formulations offer to fill out
the right-hand side of the biconditional &ldquo;E1 and E2 are
phenomenally unified iff &hellip;&rdquo; in more fundamental terms.
But there are alternative ways to understand and articulate the
question. One option is to pose the question in terms of grounding:
when experiences are unified what are the fundamental personal-level
facts, if any, in virtue of which they are unified? It is also
possible to put the question in terms of the constitution of the unity
relation.</p>

<p>
There are significant differences between these articulations.
Grounding and constitution are asymmetric metaphysical relations. When
something grounds something else it is in some sense metaphysically
more fundamental than what it grounds. But biconditional dependence is
symmetric. On the other hand, analyses of nature in terms of grounding
or constitution may not come with strict commitments about necessary
and sufficient conditions. So, strictly speaking, the various
participants in the debate focus on different questions in their
analysis of the nature of unity. But in what follows, we will ignore
these differences and assume that these accounts aim to answer the
same basic question.</p>

<p>
As we are using the term, the question about the metaphysical nature
of unity is a question about its analysis in subjective terms. A
primitivist, for example, holds that unity cannot be analyzed in other
subjective terms and a representationalist, in contrast, offers to
analyze unity in terms of facts about the contents of experiences.
Thus, contemporary debates about the metaphysical nature of unity
differentiate this topic from questions about the physical correlates
of unity. Construed in this way, a primitivist account of the unity
relation is compatible with the position that the unity relation is
identical with or supervenes on a functional or psycho-neural
type.</p>

<p>
Analyses of the nature of unity can be divided into those that appeal
to a primitive form of oneness or singularity as the ground for unity
and those that appeal to a
 relation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 The following example illustrates the distinction. John and Mary are
members of the Jacksons family. We can ask what is it in virtue of
which John and Mary are family members of each other. One answer could
be that they stand in this relation in virtue of the fact that they
are both members of the Jackson family. This answer appeals to a form
of oneness or singularity, namely, the Jackson family. A second answer
is that John and Mary are family-members because they are connected
via an unbroken form of parent-child relations. This answer appeal to
a relation. We can call the former type of answer a oneness-first
answer and the latter a relation-first answer. The same generic
distinction applies to the topic at hand. Analyses of the nature of
unity relation can be roughly divided into oneness-first and
relation-first camps. Some accounts appeal to a primitive form of
oneness. Some, on the other hand, offer to analyze unity in terms of
relations.</p>

<h4 id="OneFirVie">2.1.1 Oneness-first Views</h4>

<p>
Oneness-first accounts appeal to a primitive form of oneness in their
analyzes of the nature of unity. Such views come in several versions.
Bayne and Chalmers (2003) offer the view that experiences are unified
when they are subsumed under a single encompassing experience. Bayne
later develops this into a mereological account on which experiences
are unified when they are parts of an encompassing experience.</p>

<p>
Other notable oneness-first views include Tye (2003) and Peacocke
(2014). Tye analyzes unity in terms of the unity of phenomenal
content, where phenomenal contents are unified in virtue of being
parts of a single encompassing
 content.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Peacocke (2014) defends a oneness-first account on which experiences
are unified in virtue of belonging to the same single subject. Many
historical figures have also been interpreted in oneness-first
 fashions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A good representative of recent oneness-first views is Bayne&rsquo;s
mereological account. On Bayne&rsquo;s view, the unity of a set of
experience is a matter of them being parts of a total experience.
Bayne&rsquo;s view has been criticized on several grounds, some of
which are, arguably, generalizable to other oneness-first
accounts.</p>

<p>
A key target of this criticism is Bayne&rsquo;s commitment to the
thesis that experiences are unified only if they jointly constitute a
single encompassing experience. We can call this thesis
 experientialism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Some have criticized experientialism on introspective grounds. Hill
2014, for example, argues that no matter how much he tries, he cannot
find an experience that encompasses all the experiences that he has at
any moment. Bayne responds to this argument by denying that we cannot
find such an experience under introspection. Another criticism is that
experientialism is in tension with the principle that experiences must
be partly individuated in terms of their objects. If we accept this
principle, experientialism would be true only if there is a single
object that somehow encompasses all the experiences that exist in a
unified stream of consciousness at each moment. And it is unlikely
that we can find such an object.</p>

<p>
A second concern about Bayne&rsquo;s view is its substantiality,
especially given the fact that proponents of this view do not offer an
analysis of mereology. If we accept unrestricted mereology, there will
always be another entity of which two experiences are parts. For
example, there is an entity that has my smell experience and your
auditory experiences as parts. Since these two experiences are not
phenomenally unified with each other, this would obviously be the
wrong analysis. But rather than providing a mereological account,
Bayne appeals to our intuitive grasp of a phenomenal field. But this
threatens the substantiality of the account. For, our intuitive grasp
of a phenomenal field is too close to our intuitive grasp of
phenomenal unity.</p>

<p>
One concern here is whether the same generic problem threatens most
other oneness-first accounts of the nature of unity or not. These
accounts appeal to some form of primitive oneness. But if the oneness
that they appeal to is too close to the unity relation that they aim
to analyze, they might fail to positively contribute to our
understanding of the phenomenon that they aim to explain. The concern
thus is, as is sometimes put, whether oneness-first accounts are
sufficiently ampliative.</p>

<h4 id="RelFirVie">2.1.2 Relation-first Views</h4>

<p>
Perhaps the first contemporary relation-first account of unity is
Dainton 2005, who argues that co-consciousness (Dainton&rsquo;s label
for phenomenal unity), is a primitive unanalyzable relation.
Dainton&rsquo;s account has been criticized as violating Occam&rsquo;s
razor. According to this criticism, Occam&rsquo;s razor demands that
we accept primitivist accounts only in those circumstances where they
provide better explanations than their rivals and it is not clear that
Dainton&rsquo;s primitivist view satisfies this demand (Hill
2018).</p>

<p>
But not all relation-first views are primitivist. Masrour&rsquo;s
(2014a,b, 2020) connectivity view, Watzl&rsquo;s (2014) analysis in
terms of foreground-background relations in attentional structure, and
Roelofs&rsquo; (2014) proposal to analyze unity it in terms of
attentional and/or causal proximity are all examples of views that
attempt to offer a non-primitivist analysis of unity in relational
terms.</p>

<h4 id="DoeUniHavUniNat">2.1.3 Does Unity Have a Uniform Nature?</h4>

<p>
The views that we have discussed so far aim to offer a uniform
analysis of phenomenal unity. But Hill (2018) has recently argued that
this is wrong-headed. On Hill&rsquo;s view, our intuitions about unity
track several distinct relations such as introspective unity,
representational unity, binding unity, access unity, and attentional
unity. These relations are bound together by resemblance, not by
sameness of nature. Hill thus embraces a disjunctive account on which
whenever two conscious experiences are unified, they stand in either
one of these relations. He calls the resulting view the multiple
relations theory.</p>

<p>
To defend the multiple relations theory, Hill needs to show that there
is no general relation of unity. But he does not directly argue for
this claim. Instead, his arguments are directed against specific
analyses of unity such as Bayne&rsquo;s mereological thesis and
Tye&rsquo;s phenomenal content view. But it is unclear how these
arguments entitle Hill to the sweeping conclusion that no general
account of unity can be given.</p>

<h4 id="UniExpPar">2.1.4 Unity and Experiential Parts</h4>

<p>
The views that we have offered so far presuppose that unity is a
relation among experiences. But this assumption is controversial. Some
theorists, as early as James, have defended the view that a unified
consciousness consist only of a single experience and does not include
experiences as parts (James 1890). James thus adopts a
no-experiential-parts (NEP) account of unity. On this view, it is
wrong to say that Mary has an auditory experience of the music and a
distinct visual experience of the protesters. Rather, Mary has a
single experience that has auditory and visual contents. Several
contemporary theorists disagree with James. They hold that unified
consciousness can have experiences as parts (EP). We will discuss the
debate between the proponents of EP and NEP in the next section. But
before doing so, a brief discussion of the potential relationship
between this debate and the debate over the nature of unity is in
order.</p>

<p>
Tye 2003 has argued that many contemporary analyzes of unity are
problematic because they are committed to EP. Obviously, the
plausibility of Tye&rsquo;s argument depends partly on whether EP
should be rejected. But is the debate over the nature of the unity
deeply dependent on the debate between EP and NEP? Arguably, the
answer is negative. Let us assume that NEP is correct. If so, what we
ordinarily call Mary&rsquo;s auditory and visual experiences are not
distinct experiences. Let us call them experience-slices instead. We
can then get NEP-compatible versions of the many of the aforementioned
accounts of the nature of unity by re-articulating them in terms of
experience-slices. For example, the NEP-compatible version of
Bayne&rsquo;s mereological view would tell us that experience-slices
are unified in virtue of the fact that they are parts of a single
encompassing experience, while the NEP-compatible version of
Dainton&rsquo;s view would be the view that experience-slices are
unified in virtue of the fact that they stand in a primitive
co-consciousness relation with each other. Thus, it seems that even if
Tye is right and NEP is correct, the debate over the nature of unity
does not disappear, it gets rearticulated in terms of a debate over
whether and how unity can be understood in terms of relations between
experience-slices. If this is correct, then the debate about the
nature of unity is immune to Tye&rsquo;s objection.</p>

<h3 id="ExpParNoExpPar">2.2 Experiential Parts or No Experiential Parts</h3>

<p>
The vignette that we used earlier to introduce phenomenal unity
sketched the complex content of Mary&rsquo;s consciousness at a
moment: seeing the protesters, hearing the music, feeling the warmth
of the steering wheel, etc. How many experiences was Mary enjoying at
that moment? In general, how is a unified but complex conscious
experience structured at each moment? As noted in the previous
section, two incompatible answers to this question have some currency,
namely the experiential-parts view (EP) and the no-experiential-parts
view (NEP).</p>

<p>
On EP, a unified stream of consciousness includes simpler experiences
as parts or something like parts. On this view, Mary&rsquo;s unified
consciousness had several experiences as parts, including visual,
auditory, tactile, and mood experiences. These simpler experiences
were phenomenally unified parts of Mary&rsquo;s consciousness. In
general, EP holds that a unified consciousness can include several
experiences as phenomenally unified
 parts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 On NEP, in contrast, Mary&rsquo;s experience did not have distinct
experiences as parts. Rather, she had a single experience with a
complex content. In general, NEP holds that a unified conscious
experience necessarily consists of a single conscious experience that
typically has a complex
 content.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Part of what is at stake in this dispute is how to individuate
experiences. There are several individuating schemes that would
support EP. For example, both tripartite individuation and
object-centered schemes support EP. The former scheme individuates
experiences in terms of phenomenal properties, times, and subjects of
experience, while the latter individuates experiences in terms of
their objects, times and
 subjects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="ArgAgaEP">2.2.1 Arguments Against EP</h4>

<p>
If NEP is true, we should reject the individuation schemes that yield
EP. But why should we accept NEP? One of the arguments in favor of NEP
is due to James who describes it in his oft-cited example of the
twelve-word sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Take a sentence of a dozen words, take twelve men, and to each one
word. Then stand the men in a row or jam them in a bunch and let each
think of his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be a
consciousness of the whole sentence. (James 1890: 160)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two ways to understand James&rsquo; worry. On the first way,
what proponents of EP need is a way of combining experiences that (a)
does not simply conjoin them into an experiential aggregate, and (b)
preserves their identity as distinct experiences, and this, James
thinks, is impossible. As James sees it, when experiences <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em> are fused to form another experience <em>c</em>,
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are superseded by <em>c</em>, not included
in it. The experiences have therefore been replaced by <em>c</em>,
which somehow connects their contents. As James puts it, contrasting
the unified consciousness of the whole alphabet with the several
states involved in consciousness of each letter taken singly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is safer &hellip; to treat the consciousness of the alphabet as a
twenty-seventh fact, <em>the substitute and not the sum</em> of the
twenty-six simpler consciousnesses. (1909: 189)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A second way to understand James&rsquo; worry puts the emphasis on the
fact that his example involves distinct subjects of experience. On
this reading, we cannot combine different conscious experiences
because such a combination would require combining different subjects
to get a new subject and it is impossible to combine subjects.</p>

<p>
On reflection, there are multiple ways for the proponents of EP to
resist James&rsquo; argument. One way to see this is to contrast EP
with another view that James&rsquo; argument has been taken to
threaten. That view is constitutive panpsychism. On this view,
consciousness is part and parcel of the fabric of the world. Even some
fundamental physical particles have conscious experiences. Moreover,
macro-experiences, that is, the experiences of middle-sized subjects
like human beings and animals, are constituted by micro-experiences,
that is, experiences of fundamental particles from which the
macro-subjects emerge. It has been argued that James&rsquo; argument
poses a threat to constitutive panpsychism because it shows that the
idea that micro-experiences can combine to form macro-experience is
problematic. This issue is often discussed under the label
&ldquo;combination
 problem&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Arguably, James&rsquo; argument threatens constitutive panpsychism
more than it threatens EP. This is because there are substantive
differences between constitutive panpsychism and EP. For one thing,
although EP is committed to the thesis that complex experiences have
parts, it is not committed to the further thesis that complex
experiences are composed from their parts, that is, they somehow
emerge from, or are grounded in relations among, their experiential
parts. Proponents of EP may thus reply to James by pointing out that
they never intended to give a compositional <em>account</em> of
unified conscious states in terms of their parts. EP might be true
even if there is no way for experiential parts to combine to form
complex experiences.</p>

<p>
But even those who accept the compositional version of EP can resist
James&rsquo; argument. This is clearer under the second reading of the
argument. On this reading, the argument has two premises: (a)
combining experiences in a manner that gives rise to complex
experiences involves getting new subjects by combining distinct
subjects, and (b) it is impossible to combine distinct subjects to get
a new subject. But it is not clear why the proponents of constitutive
EP should be committed to (a). For, they can simply hold that a
complex experiential state and all the component experiences that
constitute it have the same single subject. So, the type of
combination that EP presupposes, does not require new subjects.</p>

<p>
EP&rsquo;s response to the first reading of James&rsquo; argument is
not as obvious. But this reading seems to turn James&rsquo; point into
an acute question than an argument. For, it is unclear why it is
impossible to combine distinct experiences in a manner that preserves
their distinctness. In fact, some have argued that the type of
relation that can do this job might be phenomenal unity. So, an
argument against EP should tell us that phenomenal unity among
distinct experiences is impossible. But under the first reading,
James&rsquo; argument does not give us an independent reason for this
claim.</p>

<p>
It is this independent reason that a second objection to EP, sometimes
called the phenomenal bloat objection, aims to provide. There are
several versions of this argument. Here, we will rehearse the version
in Tye 2003. Tye&rsquo;s argument, put roughly, is as follows. Let us
assume, with EP, that experiences, \(E_1, \ldots, E_n\) are parts of a
complex unified consciousness. Let us call the phenomenal unity
relation between these experiences \(R_1\). \(R_1\) should itself be
an experience, otherwise it would not make a difference to the
phenomenal character of the complex conscious state, as phenomenal
unity should. But then this experience must itself stand in a
phenomenal unity relation with \(E_1, \ldots, E_n\). Call this
relation \(R_2\). We can apply the same line of reasoning about
\(R_1\) to \(R_2\), generating the need for \(R_3\), and so on ad
infinitum. Therefore, EP results in an infinity of experiences. So, we
have a reductio against
 EP.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
There are multiple ways to resist this argument. Perhaps the most
promising line of response is to reject the premise that if phenomenal
unity relations make a difference to the phenomenal character of a
complex experience, then they are themselves experiences. This is
because the proper way of thinking about phenomenal unity might be
that unity is a matter of the manner of having experiences. Manners of
having experiences are not strictly speaking experiences, but they
make a difference to the phenomenal character of
 experience.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="UniThe">2.3 The Unity Thesis</h3>

<p>
It is not uncommon to hold that, in some sense, unity belongs to the
nature or essence of consciousness. Kant is sometimes interpreted in
this way (Brook 1994), but some contemporary theorists also allude to
the idea (Searle 2000, 562; Bayne 2010, 15; Masrour 2020, 215). Here,
we review two ways in which this idea has been articulated.</p>

<p>
Bayne 2010 articulates the relationship between unity and the nature
of consciousness in terms of the Unity Thesis (see also Bayne and
Chalmers 2003). According to this thesis, necessarily, all of the
synchronous conscious experiences of a subject at a time are unified
with each other. For Bayne, the relevant notion of a subject is a
biological notion according to which a subject is an animal of some
sort. But if we think of the Unity Thesis as one way to articulate the
intuition that unity belongs to the nature or essence of consciousness
then whether the thesis has to be formulated in terms of a biological
notion of a subject becomes a substantive question. Bayne understands
the sense of necessity here in parallel lines; the Unity Thesis is
true as a &ldquo;biological necessity&rdquo;, where a biological
necessity is to be understood in terms of an organism&rsquo;s design
specifications. Thus, it is part of the biological design
specification of human beings that their synchronous conscious
experiences are unified with each other.</p>

<p>
Bayne motivates the Unity Thesis on introspective grounds.
Introspection tells us that our conscious experiences at each moment
are unified with each other. This, Bayne argues, provides strong
support for the thesis, though admittedly does not entail it.</p>

<p>
The Unity Thesis has been criticized in several respects. One common
criticism is that the thesis has many counterexamples. For example,
subjects who undergo callosotomy operations (split-brain subjects) do
not have a unified stream of conscious experience (Tye 2003; Hill
2014, 2018; Masrour 2014b). Bayne has given a two-pronged response. He
argues against the idea that split-brain patients have disunified
consciousness (Bayne 2008, 2010). But he also adds to this that even
if we assume that split-brain subjects have disunified consciousness,
they will not pose a counterexample for the unity thesis because the
thesis is necessary only in the biological sense. We will review the
debate over the structure of consciousness in split-brains in section
3.1.</p>

<p>
Additionally, it has been argued that the Unity Thesis does not
properly articulate the essential relationship between consciousness
and unity. Masrour (2020), for example, argues that a proper
specification of this relation should not include a reference to the
subjects of experience. He offers to articulate the relation in terms
of a thesis that he dubs pure extrinsic unity. According to this
thesis, necessarily any experience is unified with a numerically
distinct experience with which it does not stand in part&ndash;whole
relations.</p>

<p>
The introspective support for the Unity Thesis has also been
questioned. Firstly, introspection might be constrained by
informational bottlenecks that may not apply to phenomenal
consciousness. Secondly, introspection might lack sensitivity to
disunity, that is, in those cases that our conscious experience is
disunified, we may not be able to introspectively tell that it is so.
Lastly, introspection could itself be a mechanism for unifying
otherwise disunified experiences. Whether these observations undermine
the epistemic significance of introspection is not a straightforward
 matter.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="DisUni">3. Disorders of Unity</h2>

<p>
Several disorders have been historically discussed as potential cases
in which unity of consciousness breaks within a subject. These cases
can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category
contains cases where consciousness seems to split within one brain and
body. The much-discussed split-brain cases resulting from
callosotomies (surgical operations in which the corpus callosum that
connects the two hemispheres is cut) are the best-known examples of
this category. Dissociative identity disorder also falls into this
category. The second category includes potential cases in which unity
of consciousness, to dramatize a bit, appears shattered or fragmented.
Schizophrenia is a prominent member of this group. Finally, there are
cases in which the array of phenomena encompassed by unified
consciousness becomes unusually restricted; hemi-neglect and
anosognosia are two notable examples. In what follows, we review some
of the cases in the first two categories, devoting the bulk of the
discussion to split-brain cases. As we shall see, whether split-brains
count as failures of phenomenal unity is a complex and controversial
issue. We will not review the third category as, arguably, although
they are disorders of consciousness, the case that the members of this
category count as disorders of unity of consciousness is very
weak.</p>

<h3 id="SplBra">3.1 Split-Brains</h3>

<p>
No medical procedure to do with consciousness has received as much
philosophical attention in recent times as callosotomies, more
commonly known as split-brain operations. The peculiar outcomes
observed in controlled conditions following these operations played an
important role in renewing interest in the unity of consciousness
within cognitive science and
 philosophy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
During callosotomies, the corpus callosum, a large bundle of
approximately 200 million neurons that facilitates communication
between the hemispheres, is partially or fully severed. These
operations, predominantly conducted in the 1960s but still performed
in modified forms, serve as a final resort to control severe forms of
epilepsy by preventing seizures from spreading across different lobes
of the cerebral
 cortex.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 Individuals who have undergone partial or complete callosotomy are
commonly referred to as split-brain subjects. But for the most part,
the evidence pertaining to divided consciousness comes only from full
callosal sections.</p>

<p>
In their everyday lives, split-brain subjects exhibit little
noticeable effect from the operation. Surprisingly, their conscious
life remains seemingly
 unified.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 This persistence of unity is intriguing, but what makes it even more
fascinating is that, under specific laboratory conditions, these
patients demonstrate behavior that is suggestive of two independent
centers of consciousness, each associated with one of the cerebral
hemispheres.</p>

<p>
To understand this, we should note that the human brain normally
lateralizes the task of processing sensory and motor information
between its two hemispheres. For example, the visual pathways are
structured in such a manner that stimuli from each side of the visual
field are sent to the contralateral hemisphere: visual stimuli from
the right visual field (RVF) are primarily processed by the left
hemisphere, while stimuli from the left visual field (LVF) are
processed by the right hemisphere. In an intact brain, the corpus
callosum enables communication between the two hemispheres, so the
lateralization of the connections does not disrupt the bilateral
integration of information. But in split-brain subjects, callosotomy
disrupts the transfer of information between the two hemispheres, and
this disruption can be behaviorally manifested in special experimental
settings<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>
To illustrate, imagine presenting the word &ldquo;TAXABLE&rdquo; on a
screen in front of a split-brain patient in a manner that
&ldquo;TAX&rdquo; only appears in the subject&rsquo;s LVF and
&ldquo;ABLE&rdquo; only appears in their RVF. When asked to verbalize
what word is being shown, the verbal response, typically controlled by
the left hemisphere, will be &ldquo;ABLE.&rdquo; However, if the
patient is instructed to write down what they see using their left
hand, which is predominantly controlled by the right hemisphere, they
typically write &ldquo;TAX.&rdquo; Thus, LVF stimuli are available
only to the right hemisphere for report and control of action, while
RVF stimuli are available only to the left hemisphere. Visual
information, therefore, does not seem to be fully access unified in
split-brain subjects. The same observation applies to other sensory
modalities that exhibit significant lateralization, such as
 touch.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The failure of access unity has led some researchers to the conclusion
that split-brain subjects enjoy two separate streams of conscious
experience at each moment. But whether this two-streams model
accurately represents the structure of consciousness in split-brain
subjects remains a highly debated question.</p>

<p>
One reason for this is that the empirical profile of split-brain
subjects encompasses more than just the failure of access unity.
Firstly, anecdotal evidence suggests that split-brain subjects rarely
show behavioral signs of access unity failure in everyday contexts,
and when present, such signs are minor. Secondly, even in experimental
settings, split-brain subjects can display signs of partial
integration between the two hemispheres. The simplest form of this
integration is the integration of emotional experience. But there is
even evidence of some sensory
 integration.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 Thirdly, although in experimental conditions the split hemispheres
typically guide disconnected behaviors that conflict with each other,
split-brain subjects are not usually conscious of this conflict. The
behavioral profile of split-brain subjects is therefore intricate, and
this has led some to adopt alternative models of the split-brain
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
We review these models and the status of the debate below. Before
discussing the models however, it is worth distinguishing between two
questions about split-brains. The first question concerns the
structure of conscious experience in split-brain patients, roughly,
whether split-brain subjects possess two separate streams of
consciousness or enjoy a single unified stream. The second question is
whether split-brains pose a counterexample to the Unity Thesis. These
questions are interconnected: if split-brain subjects preserve their
identity as single subjects while exhibiting disunified streams of
consciousness then the Unity Thesis might have a
 counterexample.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 However, the issue of whether split-brain patients preserve their
identity as single subjects is not resolved solely by answering the
structural
 question.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 In the following discussion, we will start with the structural
question and end with its implications for the Unity Thesis.</p>

<h4 id="ModConSplBraSub">3.1.1 Models of Consciousness in Split-Brain Subjects</h4>

<p>
Views about the structure of consciousness in split-brain subjects can
be divided into three categories: two-stream views, single-stream
views, and partial-stream views. As we saw, on two-stream models,
split-brain subjects have two synchronous and separate streams of
conscious experience each hosted by one of the hemispheres. This view
was common among early researchers in the field and remains one of the
main models of the structure of consciousness in split-brains.
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
According to single-stream views, split-brain subjects experience a
single unified stream of consciousness at any given moment. This view
comes in three flavors. On one version of the view, only one of the
hemispheres, typically the hemisphere associated with language, hosts
this single stream. This view has been attributed to some early
researchers and goes along with the cognitivist thesis that
consciousness requires linguistic capacities. But the view does not
seem to have many contemporary
 advocates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 On a second version of the single-stream view, split-brain subjects
possess one unified stream of consciousness hosted by a single
hemisphere at any given moment. But the hosting hemisphere can switch.
This view is often called the
 switch-model.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 On the third version of the single-stream view, split-brain subjects
enjoy a single phenomenally unified stream of consciousness, hosted by
both hemispheres. Proponents of this view argue that the empirical
data from split-brain studies only supports the failure of access
unity, and access disunity is compatible with phenomenal
 unity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On partial-stream views, split-brain subjects have a partially unified
stream of consciousness that spans both hemispheres. A partially
unified stream of consciousness contains experiences that are not
unified with each other but are linked by being unified with a third
experience.</p>

<p>
As we shall soon see, partial-stream views provide an attractive
explanation of the complex empirical profile of split-brain subjects.
However, such views entail that phenomenal unity is not a transitive
relation, and this has led to some degree of
 skepticism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The above views can be combined to create hybrid versions. A common
hybrid option is that split-brain subjects have two-streams of
consciousness in experimental contexts, but they enjoy either a fully
unified or a partially unified in everyday
 contexts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Although there are at least five core and several hybrid options that
have been adopted for modeling split-brain consciousness, two of the
core one-stream options, namely the &ldquo;one conscious
hemisphere&rdquo; and &ldquo;access disunity without phenomenal
disunity&rdquo; ones, do not seem to have advocates among contemporary
theorists. The &ldquo;one conscious hemisphere&rdquo; view lost
support not only because of the unpopularity of the idea that
linguistic capacities are necessary for conscious experience, but also
due to evidence suggesting that both hemispheres are conscious as
well.
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In earlier work, Bayne and Chalmers defended the &ldquo;phenomenal
unity without access unity&rdquo; account. Drawing on Sperling&rsquo;s
influential experiments, they argued that access unity is susceptible
to informational bottlenecks that do not affect phenomenal unity.
Therefore, rather than appealing to failures of phenomenal unity, we
can explain failures of access unity in terms of informational
limitations that restrict access
 unity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 However, Bayne later abandoned this model in favor of the
&ldquo;switch model&rdquo;. One reason for this was that, despite the
complex relationship between access unity and phenomenal unity, access
disunity remains the strongest behavioral evidence for phenomenal
disunity. Thus, disregarding access disunity as evidence for
phenomenal disunity threatens to jeopardize the empirical basis of the
ongoing debate.</p>

<p>
Contemporary discussion has thus mostly revolved around the
two-streams, the partial-stream, the switch model, and a few hybrid
versions that combine these core options. In what follows, we present
a closer review of the status of the debate regarding these
 models.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="TwoStrModVar">3.1.2 The Two-streams Model and its Variants</h4>

<p>
Under the orthodox version of the two-stream model, split-brain
consciousness consists of two fully disunified streams hosted by the
two hemispheres, both inside and outside experimental
 conditions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 We call this model the pure two-stream model to contrast it with
hybrid models that apply the two-stream model to a limited set of
conditions. Proponents of the pure model defend it on multiple
grounds: (a) the observed behavioral pattern among split-brain
subjects that is indicative of access disunity, (b) the lack of
sufficient neural connectivity between the two hemispheres, and (c)
the implausibility of the alternative models or the lack of evidential
support for them. We can think of these as together constituting an
abductive argument for the pure two-stream model. Given diminished
inter-hemispheric neural connectivity and the implausibility of
alternative models, the two-stream model is the best explanation for
the behavior of split-brain subjects.</p>

<p>
This said, both the pure two-stream model and the arguments in its
support have also received serious criticism. Opponents argue that the
two-stream model has difficulty explaining three aspects of the
intricate profile of split-brain subjects. First, there is evidence of
partial inter-hemispheric integration among split-brains. Second, the
behavior exhibited by split-brain subjects in everyday life is, more
or less, unified. And third, there are no signs of awareness of
inter-hemispheric conflict among split-brain subjects. We review the
first two of these challenges
 below.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As an example of partial integration and why it might be troubling for
the two-stream model, consider an extended version of our earlier
example in which a split-brain subject has a visual experience, E1, of
&ldquo;Tax&rdquo;, hosted by the right hemisphere, and another visual
experience, E2, of &ldquo;able&rdquo;, hosted by the left hemisphere.
Let&rsquo;s add to this that the subject also has a fear experience
that is access unified with both E1 and E2. This would constitute a
case of partial integration because, although E1 and E2 are not
integrated with each other, both are integrated with the fear
experience. Partial integration is not rare among split-brain
subjects. In fact, partial integration is to be expected because
callosotomy does not sever the sub-cortical connections between the
two hemispheres, and it is commonly held that the neural correlates of
affective experience are sub-cortical.</p>

<p>
But partial integration is not in itself sufficient for ruling out the
two-stream model. To rule out the two-stream model, one needs to see
partial integration as evidence for partial unity and this is what the
opponents of the two-stream model try to establish. They argue that
many cases of partial integration are in fact cases of partial unity
and this is a reason to reject the two-stream model. In our toy
example, E1 and E2 are not unified, but there is a single fear
experience, E3, that is unified with E1 and E2. Since this is
incompatible with the two-stream model, we should reject this
model.</p>

<p>
Proponents of the two-stream model have responded in a variety of
ways. Schechter (2018), for example, questions the partial integration
of affective experience by arguing that the neural correlates of
emotional experience are not confined to sub-cortical areas. However,
given the difficulty in settling disputes about the neural correlates
of conscious experience, this remains an open issue. Moreover, it is
questionable whether all the evidence indicative of partial
integration can be explained away in a similar
 fashion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A second response to the partial integration argument appeals to what
is sometimes dubbed the duplication gambit. On this strategy, we
should understand our example as a case where there are two fear
experiences, E3* and E3** with the same fear content, where E3* is
unified with E1 and E3** is unified with E2. On this interpretation,
there is no single fear experience that is shared between the
two-streams. Generally, partial integration does not entail partial
unity, as it can be explained by
 duplication.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 Those who adopt this strategy argue that the behavioral data for
partial integration can be accommodated by the two-streams model.</p>

<p>
But it has been argued that the duplication gambit is incompatible
with the most plausible ways to individuate experience. Bayne (2008,
2010), for example, rejects this option on the grounds that it is
incompatible with the tripartite conception of experience. On this
conception, experiences should be individuated by their subjects,
contents, and times of occurrence. This conception implies that a
single subject cannot have numerically distinct synchronous
experiences with the same content. It will not do, Bayne argues, to
individuate experiences partly by appealing to their neural
correlates. For, accepting such a view would sever the connection
between introspection, and the phenomenal character of
 experience.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A second challenge for the two-stream model is the seemingly unified
behavior of split-brain subjects outside experimental conditions
(Bayne 2008, 2010; Godfrey Smith 2022; Lycan 2022). If, as the pure
two-streams model contends, split-brain subjects enjoy two independent
streams of consciousness at all times, then we should expect to see
behavioral signs of disunity in everyday contexts, but we do not see
such signs, at least not as frequently as we might
 expect.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 How can the two-stream model accommodate this fact?</p>

<p>
On the face of it, there are several options for the two-stream model
here. One option is to argue that in everyday contexts the two
hemispheres can gain access to the same information (for example, by
movement) and, as a result, the two hemispheres often host experiences
with the same contents. In other words, the two streams duplicate some
of each other&rsquo;s experiences. This option, therefore, gives rise
to the same questions and issues that the duplication response to
partial integration gives rise to.</p>

<p>
A second option would be to abandon the pure two-streams view in favor
of a hybrid version. A somewhat popular version of this move is to
hold that split-brain subjects are disunified in cognitively demanding
conditions, whether they are experimental conditions or everyday
contexts, yet enjoy a single unified stream of consciousness hosted by
both hemispheres in non-demanding everyday conditions (Hurley 1998,
Tye 2003, Downey 2018, Godfrey Smith 2022). Another option would be to
combine the two-streams view with a partial unity account
(Godfrey-Smith 2020, ch. 6).</p>

<p>
The hybrid views give rise to interesting questions about the vehicles
of consciousness and their relationship to phenomenal structure. Given
that split-brain subjects remain partially neurally split in all
conditions, how could their consciousness switch from a two-stream
structure in experimental conditions to a unified or partially unified
single stream that expands over both hemispheres in non-experimental
conditions?</p>

<p>
One response has been to appeal to a form of vehicle externalism on
which reafferent sensorimotor feedback can extend beyond the brain and
unify the two hemispheres. A view like this was originally proposed in
Hurley (1998) and recently developed and defended in Downey (2018),
and Godfrey-Smith (2020). Godfrey-Smith links this issue with animal
consciousness. As he notes, lateralization of cognitive abilities is
very common in animals. Moreover, in many animal brains, direct
inter-hemispheric connections are sparse. Extensive and direct
connections between the two hemispheres are confined to placental
mammals. Inter-hemispheric connectivity diminishes when we move to
non-placental mammals, shrinks further more among birds, and reaches
minimal levels in reptiles and fish. Despite this, most animals
exhibit unified agency and unified mindedness. This, Godfrey-Smith
argues, lends support to an externalist account of mental and
experiential unity.</p>

<p>
This form of vehicle externalism invites counter-responses that are
familiar from the debate over the extended mind (see the entry on
 <a href="../content-externalism/">externalism about the mind</a>).
 Opponents typically argue that sensory and action systems form a
boundary around the mind and interaction across this boundary do not
count as a form of integration that can unify a mind (Schechter 2018,
Bayne 2010).</p>

<h4 id="SwiMod">3.1.3 The Switch Model</h4>

<p>
On the switch model, split-brain subjects have a single unified stream
of consciousness that alternates between the hemispheres, depending on
which hemisphere wins the competition for focal attention. Proponents
of this model have cited multiple sources of evidence in its support.
There is, for example, some empirical data indicating extinction: one
hemisphere can become unconscious when the other takes control or is
primed for action. Additionally, evidence for the view that focal
attention is necessary for
 consciousness<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>,
 combined with the observation that the two hemispheres can compete
for focal attentional in a winner-takes-all
 manner<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 indirectly supports the switch model. Bayne, the key contemporary
proponent of the switch model, further argues for its validity based
on the Unity Thesis. If the synchronous conscious experiences of a
subject are necessarily unified, and split-brain patients maintain
their identity as single subjects, then split-brain subjects must have
a single unified stream of conscious experience at each moment and the
switch model is arguably the best way to explain this result.</p>

<p>
However, the switch model faces several challenges, some of which are
similar to those encountered by the two-stream model. One challenge is
explaining the unified behavior of split-brain subjects in everyday
contexts. Bayne suggests three possible explanations: (a) a single
conscious hemisphere predominantly controls behavior in everyday life,
(b) rapid inter-hemispheric switches might create the illusion of
unified behavior guided by rich experience, or (c) split-brain
subjects may rely on non-focal attention in everyday contexts,
allowing for a unified conscious stream across both hemispheres.</p>

<p>
A second challenge for the switch model is the evidence of
inter-hemispheric integration. Note that like the two-streams model,
the switch model accepts that the two hemispheres are, for the most
part, informationally isolated. Thus, evidence of partial integration
would be challenging for this view too. In response, it has been
argued that the available empirical evidence for partial integration
is inconclusive and subject to alternative interpretations, including
unconscious integration, priming effects, and non-synchronous
conscious integration.</p>

<p>
A third challenge is that split-brain subjects rarely exhibit signs of
interhemispheric conflict. If consciousness switches from one
hemisphere to another and the two hemispheres can host representations
with conflicting contents, we expect to observe signs that one or both
of the hemispheres are conscious of this conflict. But we do not
observe such signs. In response, Bayne suggests exploring parallels
with cases of cognitive deficits where subjects are unaware of their
impairments, but he admits that this remains the most serious
challenge for the switch
 model.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The switch model&rsquo;s appeal to the idea that the two hemispheres
compete for focal attention has also come under pressure. Hill (2018)
cites evidence that competition for focal attention often has a
center-surround structure, but such competition patterns are often
intra-hemispheric. For example, focal attention to a spatial region in
LVF reduces focal attention to surrounding areas in LVF; it does not
have much impact on the distribution of attention to RVF. The switch
model&rsquo;s appeal to interhemispheric competition for attention,
Hill concludes, is empirically implausible.</p>

<p>
On reflection, the switch model is structurally similar to the
two-stream model. On both models, the two hemispheres host
informationally disunified representations. The main difference
between the two models comes down to whether both hemispheres are
conscious at any point in time or only one of them is. This
observation has several implications. First, as we have seen before,
the two views share some of their main challenges. Second,
structurally similar options are available for the two models in
response to these challenges. Consider, for example, the idea that the
unified behavior of split-brains in everyday contexts can be explained
in terms of a single hemisphere taking control of the subject&rsquo;s
behavior. On the switch model, this is the only conscious hemisphere
in those occasions. However, the two-streamers can adopt a
structurally similar strategy: they can say that one of the
split-brain patient&rsquo;s conscious streams takes over control of
action because it wins the competition for focal attention, but since
attention is not necessary for consciousness, the losing hemisphere is
still conscious. Setting aside the issue of whether focal attention is
necessary for consciousness, this two-stream response is structurally
similar to the switch model&rsquo;s. It thus seems that settling the
dispute between the two views is a matter of determining the
relationship between attention and consciousness on the one hand and
the empirical plausibility of the idea that the two hemispheres
compete for attention on the
 other.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="ParUniMod">3.1.4 The Partial Unity Model</h4>

<p>
As we saw in the preceding discussion, evidence for partial
integration and the seemingly unified behavior of split-brain subjects
in everyday conditions put some pressure on both the two-stream and
the switch models. As we also saw, proponents of these models propose
to dissolve these challenges in a variety of ways. But another way to
accommodate these challenges is to appeal to the partial-stream model.
On this model, split-brain subjects enjoy a single but partially
unified stream of consciousness. A partially unified stream of
consciousness contains experiences that are not unified with each
other but are nevertheless connected by being unified with a third
 experience.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On the pure version of the partial-stream model, split-brain subjects
are partially unified in both experimental and everyday conditions.
This model can provide a straightforward explanation of partial
integration in split-brain subjects. Furthermore, the gradeability of
partial unity enables the model to explain the differences in
split-brain behavior between experimental and non-experimental
settings in terms of fluctuations in degrees of partial unity across
different contexts. While a comprehensive account would require
understanding the mechanisms underlying partial integration and its
variations in different contexts, the partial unity model seems to
provide a more promising explanation of the empirical profile of
split-brain patients.</p>

<p>
Despite its explanatory advantages, however, partial unity has not
been a popular choice among theorists. One reason for this has been a
degree of a priori skepticism about the view, grounded in the alleged
inconceivability of partial
 unity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 There are several versions of this objection in the literature. A
simple version is based on the premise that we cannot imagine what it
is like to have a partially unified consciousness. But as opponents of
the partial unity model themselves admit, this sort of
inconceivability is hardly a guide to impossibility.</p>

<p>
A more promising version of the argument is that partial unity is
inconceivable in that &ldquo;there is nothing that would even count as
successfully imagining what it is like to have a partially unified
consciousness&rdquo; (Schechter 2014). But even this version of the
argument can be resisted. As Schechter (2014) points out, it is not
easy to see why this argument would not equally target the dual-stream
account. Suppose that the fact that there is nothing that would count
as successfully imagining what it is like to have a partially unified
consciousness is grounded in the fact there is no single subjective
point of view from which we can imagine what it is like to have a
partially unified consciousness. If so, the dual-stream model is
equally threatened by the argument. For, there is no single subjective
point of view from which we can imagine what it is like to have two
separate streams of consciousness. But it is unacceptable, Schechter
argues, to reject all contenders but the single stream view on purely
a priori grounds. So, the argument is problematic.</p>

<p>
There is a second reason to be skeptical about the inconceivability
argument against partial unity. Arguably, a subject with a partially
unified consciousness does not enjoy a full perspective that
encompasses all of their experiences at a moment. This may explain why
it is impossible to fully project oneself into the perspective of a
partially unified subject. For, any perspective that would reflect the
subjective point of view of such a subject would be either partial in
that it would not encompass the totality of the experiences that the
subject has, or it would represent it incorrectly in that it would
occupy a perspective that a subject with partial unity cannot have.
Thus, it seems that we can explain the inconceivability of partial
unity in a manner that undercuts the force of the inconceivability
argument against it.</p>

<p>
Although Schechter thinks that partial unity cannot be rejected on a
priori grounds, she has argued that there are empirical reason against
partial unity. Schechter&rsquo;s argument, put roughly, is as follows.
Take two split-brain experiences, E1 and E2, that are not unified with
each other but are unified with the phenomenal content C3. In a
situation like this, we would have two subjective perspectives, P1 and
P2, where P1 encompasses E1 and C3 while P2 encompasses E2 and C3. A
partial unity characterization of such a situation would be that there
is a single experience, E3, with the content C3, that is shared
between P1 and P2. Now suppose we have independent reasons to hold
that P1 and P2 are perspectives of distinct subjects, S1 and S2. If
so, Schechter argues, we should reject the partial unity
characterization of the situation. For on such a characterization, E3
would belong to two numerically distinct subjects, which conflicts
with the maxim that we should partially individuate experiences in
terms of their subjects. So, our empirical grounds for positing the
existence of two subjects in the split-brain case are grounds to
reject the partial unity model.</p>

<p>
Schechter&rsquo;s rejection of partial unity raises interesting
questions about the relationship between the individuation of
experience and that of subjects of experience. Suppose that subjects
of experience are grounded in physical facts/events. Then it seems
conceivable that two otherwise distinct subjects might share some of
their physical correlates and it does not seem incoherent that the
shared physical correlates might be sufficient grounds for the
emergence of an experience. This gives us a way to imagine how two
distinct subjects might share one experience. Thus, Schechter&rsquo;s
argument against partial unity is not as straightforward as it might
seem. Ultimately, the question of whether partial unity provides a
satisfactory account of split-brain patients depends on deep and
difficult issues concerning the individuation of experiences and their
subjects, which are too close to the deep questions about unity that
the debate revolves around.</p>

<h4 id="SplBraUniThe">3.1.5 Split-Brains and the Unity Thesis</h4>

<p>
Earlier we distinguished between questions about the structure of
consciousness in split-brain subjects and whether split-brain poses a
counterexample to the Unity Thesis. We have covered the former issue.
Here we will turn to the latter.</p>

<p>
As we saw, whether the two-streams model is the correct structural
model of split-brain subjects is still an open question. If the
two-streams model does not correctly depict the structure of
split-brain consciousness in any contexts, then the question about the
unity thesis does not even get off the ground. But even if it turns
out that split-brain subjects enjoy two streams in some contexts,
whether we have a counterexample to the Unity Thesis remains a
substantive issue. This is because it is not obvious how many subjects
are contained within a split-brain. Therefore, some theorists who
disagree about the structural question might agree about whether the
split-brain phenomenon poses a counterexample to the Unity Thesis.</p>

<p>
On Bayne&rsquo;s view, for example, split-brain subjects preserve
their identity as single subjects. However, Bayne maintains that the
switch model offers the best account of split-brain consciousness. He
therefore does not consider split-brains to be potential
counterexamples to the Unity
 Thesis.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 Schechter, on the other hand, defends the two-stream model. But on
her view, split-brains typically host two minds or
 subjects,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup>
 although she combines this with the thesis that split-brains are a
single person. So, if we accept Schechter&rsquo;s account of the
split-brain consciousness, whether split-brains pose a counterexample
to the Unity Thesis depends on whether the notion of the subject that
is used in the Unity Thesis corresponds to Schechter&rsquo;s notion of
subject or her notion of a
 person.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="OthDisUni">3.2 Other Disorders of Unity</h3>

<p>
As noted earlier, one way to categorize potential disorders of unity
is to divide them into three groups. In the first group, the clinical
profile is largely similar to split-brain cases, that is, empirical
evidence indicates a splitting of consciousness into several separate
centers, although whether this is indicative of a break in phenomenal
unity is controversial. The second group consists in cases where the
clinical profile is so severe that it indicates a radical
fragmentation or shattering of the unity of consciousness, rather than
a split into several centers. Finally, there are cases where the scope
of unified consciousness seems to have dramatically reduced. Here, we
review dissociative identity disorder as a representative of the first
category and schizophrenia as a representative of the second.</p>

<h4 id="DisIdeDis">3.2.1 Dissociative Identity Disorder</h4>

<p>
A candidate phenomenon in the first group of disorders is what used to
be called multiple personality disorder, now, more neutrally,
dissociative identity disorder (DID). Those who suffer from DID show
two or more distinct identities or personalities, usually referred to
as the patients&rsquo; alters. Different alters typically differ in
their desires, intentions, goals, and character traits.</p>

<p>
DID&rsquo;s behavioral manifestations can come in two forms. In one
form, the alters seem to &lsquo;take turns&rsquo; in being active and
each alter only recalls the periods in which it was active. In the
other both alters are present at the same time. Here, for example, the
alter in control of speech reports the thoughts and orders of another
&lsquo;person&rsquo; inside her, with whom she does not identify. This
form of DID is called the co-conscious form in the literature.</p>

<p>
Since late 19<sup>th</sup> century, DID has been regarded as a
disorder of the unity of consciousness, where consciousness breaks
into fragments corresponding to the different alters (See Binet 1890
[1977a,b] and Wilkes 1989). But it is not always clear whether the
early theorists saw the condition as a fragmentation of phenomenal
unity. Among recent theorists, Braude (1995) endorses the phenomenal
disunity interpretation of DID. (See also Brook 2015.)</p>

<p>
Why should we regard DID as a case of phenomenal disunity? One
argument for the view is that multiple alters correspond to different
subjects/agents/centers of consciousness and thus, there must be
multiple disunified streams of consciousness in a DID
 patient.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This argument can be resisted in several ways. Firstly, it is not
completely clear that the alters should be regarded as different
subjects/agents/centers of consciousness as opposed to different
states of a single subject/agent/center of
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup>
 So the first premise of the argument can be denied.</p>

<p>
But even if we accept this premise, it is not clear why it follows
that DID patients have multiple streams of consciousness. Take the
diachronic version of DID and let us accept that a DID patient
diachronically switches from one subject of experience to another.
Still, it might be that these different subjects are partially
overlapping in the sense that they share some of their experiences.
This is not an unreasonable position given that the multiple
personalities of a DID patients share their sensory motor capacities.
For example, a DID patient who switches from being an adult to a child
usually preserves her perceptual experience during the switch. But if
so, it is more reasonable to hold that DID patients have a
diachronically unified stream of consciousness that switches from one
subject to another.</p>

<p>
A second argument, implicit in the discussion, is that if DID patients
had a unified stream of consciousness, they would not exhibit the
symptoms that they typically do. For example, a diachronically
switching DID patient would not exhibit their typical pattern of
amnesia if they had a continuous stream of consciousness. Similarly,
the dominant alter in a co-conscious DID patient would not report that
there is a person with different thoughts and desires inside them if
the DID patient had a single stream of consciousness at every
moment.</p>

<p>
But it is unclear why we should accept that phenomenal disunity is a
necessary component of any explanation of these DID symptoms. Take the
co-conscious DID patient. One might hold that such patients are, in
relevant respects, similar to subjects suffering from hallucinations.
We do not usually conclude that a subject who hallucinates hearing
another subject talking about them suffers from phenomenal disunity.
Why should we then assume that phenomenal disunity should be assumed
in an explanation of the symptoms of a co-conscious DID
 patient?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 This is a somewhat under-explored issue.</p>

<p>
Suppose we reject the phenomenal disunity account of DID based on the
above observations. There is still a strong intuitive sense in which
DID involves a split in the unity of consciousness. If so, in what
sense is consciousness disunified in this disorder? Some have argued
that DID patients suffer from disruptions in the unity of
self-consciousness. If this is correct, then DID would be a case in
which phenomenal unity and unity of self-consciousness come apart.</p>

<h4 id="Sch">3.2.2 Schizophrenia</h4>

<p>
Schizophrenia is a disorder in which the general capacity for
regulating thought is seriously disrupted. Schizophrenic symptoms are
usually divided into positive and negative ones. Positive signs
include formal thought disorders, and disorders of thought content.
Formal thought disorders are disruptions in the structure and form of
thinking exemplified by illogical thinking, loose associations,
incoherence, derailment and tangentiality. Disorders of thought
content, broadly construed, include conditions such as delusional
thinking, sensory hallucinations, and thought insertion. Negative
signs involve deficits in affect and thought, such as anhedonia
(loosing the ability to experience pleasure) and avolition (lack of
 motivation).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-57" id="ref-57">57</a>]</sup>In
 some particularly severe forms of schizophrenia, the patient is
unable to put together perceptions, thoughts and motives into simple
plans of action or act on such plans if formed, even plans to obtain
sustenance, to tend to bodily needs, to escape painful irritants, and
so on.</p>

<p>
Theorists as early as Kraepelin (1896) have held that a breakdown in
unity of consciousness is one of the chief aspects of schizophrenia,
although what such theorists mean by unity of consciousness is not
always clear. Among contemporary theorists, Brook (2015) explicitly
describes schizophrenia as a condition of fragmentation of experience,
which is naturally interpreted as a case of fragmentation of
phenomenal consciousness.</p>

<p>
But why should we take schizophrenia as a phenomenon in which the
phenomenal unity of consciousness is fragmented? It is not easy to
find explicit arguments for this claim in the literature. But one
could identify two implicit arguments in the discussions of the topic.
These arguments are analogous in form to the arguments that we
discussed in the case of dissociative identity disorder (DID).</p>

<p>
The first argument is explanatory. What explains, or is at least a
part of what explains, a schizophrenic patient&rsquo;s thought
disorder, especially formal thought disorder, is a fragmentation of
her phenomenal experience. The second argument builds on the intuitive
sense in which the unity of a schizophrenic subject seems to be
shattered. How could schizophrenic patients have a phenomenally
unified consciousness when they are not a unified subject? We can call
this the argument from subjective disunity.</p>

<p>
Despite their intuitive pull, it is not hard to resist these
arguments. To start with the first, it makes sense to assume that
phenomenal unity might be a necessary condition for certain forms of
integration of intentional states. But it is far from clear that
phenomenal unity is sufficient for this form of integration. There is
a host of other cognitive capacities that might be required for such
integration: memory, selective attention, certain forms of emotion
regulation, and certain forms of reasoning. And although, on some
views, some of these integrative capacities are necessary for unity of
consciousness, it would be a stretch to hold that all of them are. If
so, a schizophrenic patient&rsquo;s thought disorders can be explained
in terms of such cognitive deficits and without any assumptions about
phenomenal
 disunity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-58" id="ref-58">58</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This response to the explanatory argument also sheds light on how the
argument from subjective disunity can be resisted. Let us suppose, as
the response to the explanatory argument does, that some integrative
cognitive capacities can break down despite phenomenal unity. Let us
also suppose that break down in these integrative capacities is
sufficient for subjective-disunity. It then logically follows that
subjective disunity is not sufficient for phenomenal disunity. But
this logical implication, also provides an explanation for why
subjective disunity is compatible with phenomenal unity. So, the
argument from subject-disunity to phenomenal disunity also fails.</p>

<p>
It is thus unclear that schizophrenia is an example of a shattering of
the phenomenal unity of
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-59" id="ref-59">59</a>]</sup>
 But this brings up a similar question as the one that we asked about
DID. For, there is still a strong intuitive sense in which
schizophrenic patients exhibit a fragmentation in the unity of
consciousness. If this is not phenomenal disunity, in what sense is
consciousness disunified in this disorder? This is an interesting
question that requires extensive discussion. But one answer can be
similar to the one that we gave for DID: schizophrenia can be regarded
as a disruption in the unity of some form of self-consciousness,
perhaps a form of self-consciousness that requires integrating
one&rsquo;s beliefs, emotions, intentions, and actions into a coherent
and meaningful
 narrative.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-60" id="ref-60">60</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Other disorders that some have interpreted as disorders of unity of
consciousness include simultagnosia, anasognosia, dyexecutive
disorder, and Balint&rsquo;s syndrome. Like DID and schizophrenia,
whether there is phenomenal disunity in these conditions is a
substantive and controversial issue. (For discussion see Bayne 2010
(ch. 7), and Brooke 2015.)</p>

<h2 id="UniAcrTim">4. Unity Across Time</h2>

<p>
Unified consciousness at a given time (synchronic unity) has been our
main topic so far. We now turn, more briefly, to unified consciousness
over time (diachronic unity). As was noted as long ago as Kant, unity
across time was deemed to be required even for such rudimentary mental
operations as counting (1781: A103); indeed, some form of unity across
time is crucial for virtually all cognition of any complexity. Now,
unification <em>in consciousness</em> might not be the only way to
unite earlier cognitive states (earlier thoughts, earlier experiences)
with current ones, but it is certainly a central way and the one best
known to us.</p>

<h3 id="RetMem">4.1 Retention and Memory</h3>

<p>
It is common to think that diachronically unified consciousness
requires retention of earlier experienced contents as one experienced
them. What the retention crucial to diachronic unity consists in is a
matter of some interest. It is tempting to assume that it is a kind of
memory. However, as Husserl already told us, there is reason to be
skeptical of this approach. There is a difference between
<em>experiencing</em> a succession from time 1 to time 2 and merely
<em>remembering</em> experiencing what happened at time 1 while
experiencing something at time 2. Dainton captures Husserl&rsquo;s
point by noting the difference between &ldquo;immediate and
represented experience&mdash;remembering or imagining hearing a tone
is not the same as directly experiencing the tone&rdquo; (Dainton
2005: 155; Dainton cites Husserl 1928).</p>

<p>
Kelly (2005) raises a similar question. Suppose that one is listening
to a melody. It has five notes and the final note is just being
played. If one simply recollected the earlier notes, one should
experience a chord, not five notes spread out and related to one
another in time. Somehow, the earlier notes come
&lsquo;date-stamped&rsquo; but still available to be integrated with
the current experience in a single, temporally-extended, unified
experience. Whatever this process is like, it is clearly vital to our
kind of unified consciousness. Without it, one could not hear any
sequence as a sequence or so much as read a simple sentence. Though
some theorists call this across-time process unity of consciousness, a
more distinctive name for it would be the <em>continuity of
consciousness</em>.</p>

<p>
This sort of continuity of consciousness can span very short durations
(such as the &lsquo;specious present&rsquo;). Even a seemingly simple,
current experience is in fact a continuous experience of more than one
instant, and must be if one is to hear a sound or <em>perceive</em>
(as opposed to remember) any temporally stretched phenomenon. How can
one have a unified conscious experience (not just a memory) of
duration?</p>

<p>
Here again, the debate that we mentioned earlier over whether a
unified conscious experience is one experience or an assembly of many
experiences rears its head. Dainton (2005: chs. 5&ndash;7) takes a
continuous, unified experience to include co-conscious experiences as
parts. Tye (2003: ch. 4) urges instead that a diachronically unified
experience has multiple contents but no experiences as parts.</p>

<h3 id="UniPerIde">4.2 Unity and Personal Identity</h3>

<p>
In the history of European philosophy at least since Locke, diachronic
unified consciousness has been closely linked to personal identity in
the philosopher&rsquo;s sense, i.e., continuing to be a single person,
one and the same person, across time. (The point of the restriction to
philosophy is that clinical psychologists use the term quite
differently, as the name for certain aspects of personality and
&lsquo;self-conception&rsquo;.) Whatever may be true of the kind of
diachronic unity we just discussed, the kind of diachronic unity
associated with personal identity might be a kind of memory,
specifically, a kind of autobiographical memory. At least since Locke,
philosophers have argued that as far back as unified consciousness
<em>via the right kind of autobiographical memory</em> extends, there
extends the person, one and the same person over all this time. The
right kind of autobiographical memory is memory of the having,
feeling, or doing of earlier experiences, emotions, actions, and so
on. As Locke has it, being the same person just is having the
&lsquo;<em>same consciousness</em>&rsquo;. We must be careful here.
There is lots of autobiographical memory that is not memory from the
point of view of experiencing. A person can remember that so-and-so
happened to her without remembering the event, the experience of it,
or anything else &lsquo;from the inside&rsquo;, to use
Shoemaker&rsquo;s useful metaphor again. Memory theorists&rsquo;
standard categories are not fine-grained enough for our purposes
here.</p>

<p>
Some have urged that memory-carried diachronic unity is not sufficient
for being one person over time. Kant, for example, argued for a
dissociation here, in his famous critique of the third paralogism. In
Kant&rsquo;s view, continuity sufficient to &ldquo;retain the thought
of the previous subject and so hand it over to the subsequent
subject&rdquo; (1781: A363), continuity sufficient therefore for
diachronic unity of consciousness, is quite compatible with the
&lsquo;retained thoughts&rsquo; being passed from one subject to
another, compatible therefore with an utter absence of personal
identity. If so, diachronic unity is not sufficient for personal
identity (Brook 1994: ch. 8). (Note: Locke and Kant may be less far
apart than this brief discussion would suggest. We are merely using
them to illustrate the two positions, not discussing either of them
fully.)</p>

<p>
Phenomena relevant to identity in things other than persons can be a
matter of degree. This is well illustrated by the famous ship of
Theseus. Suppose that over the years, a certain ship was rebuilt,
board by board, until every bit of it has been replaced. Is the ship
at the end of the process the ship that started the process? Now
suppose that we take all those rotten, replaced boards and reassemble
them into a ship. Is <em>this</em> ship the original ship? It seems
that there is no determinate answer to these questions. Say what you
like, and what you like may vary depending on whether you are an
insurance adjuster or a history buff. Many philosophers have insisted
that such indeterminacy can never be the case for persons. Identity in
persons is always completely unambiguous, not something that could
ever be a matter of degree (Bishop Joseph Butler [1736] is a
well-known example).</p>

<p>
Brain bisection cases in which, some urge, unified consciousness
splits in two may be relevant here (Parfit 1971, 1984). As Parfit
argues, the possibility of persons (or at any rate minds) splitting
and re-fusing puts real pressure on intuitions about our specialness.
Perhaps the continuity of persons can be just as tangled and just as
much a matter of degree as the continuity of any other middle-sized
object.</p>
