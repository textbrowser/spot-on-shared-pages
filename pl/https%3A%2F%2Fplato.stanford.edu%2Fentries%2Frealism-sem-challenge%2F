<h1>Challenges to Metaphysical Realism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jan 11, 2001; substantive revision Wed Jul 16, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">


<p>
According to metaphysical realism, the world is as it is independent
of how humans or other inquiring agents take it to be. The objects the
world contains, together with their properties and the relations they
enter into, fix the world&rsquo;s nature and these objects [together
with the properties they have and the relations they enter into] exist
independently of our ability to discover they do. Unless this is so,
metaphysical realists argue, none of our beliefs about our world could
be objectively true since true beliefs tell us how things are and
beliefs are objective when true or false independently of what anyone
might think.</p>

<p>
Many philosophers believe metaphysical realism is just plain common
sense. Others believe it to be a direct implication of modern science,
which paints humans as fallible creatures adrift in an inhospitable
world not of their making. Nonetheless, metaphysical realism is
controversial. Besides the analytic question of what it means to
assert that objects exist independently of the mind, metaphysical
realism also raises epistemological problems: how can we obtain
knowledge of a mind-independent world? There are also prior semantic
problems, such as how links are set up between our beliefs and the
mind-independent states of affairs they allegedly represent. This is
the Representation Problem.</p>

<p>
Anti-realists deny the world is mind-independent. Believing the
epistemological and semantic problems to be insoluble, they conclude
realism must be false. The first anti-realist arguments based on
explicitly semantic considerations were advanced by Michael Dummett
and Hilary Putnam. These are:</p>

<ol type="I">

<li>Dummett&rsquo;s Manifestation Argument: the cognitive and
linguistic behaviour of an agent provides no evidence that realist
mind/world links exist;</li>

<li>Dummett&rsquo;s Language Acquisition Argument: if such links were
to exist language learning would be impossible;</li>

<li>Putnam&rsquo;s Brain-in-a-Vat Argument: realism entails both that
we could be massively deluded (&lsquo;brains in a vat&rsquo;) and that
if we were we could not even form the belief that we were;</li>

<li>Putnam&rsquo;s Conceptual Relativity Argument: it is senseless to
ask what the world contains independently of how we conceive of it,
since the objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to
classify them;</li>

<li>Putnam&rsquo;s Model-Theoretic Argument: realists must either hold
that an ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or
that perfectly determinate terms like &lsquo;cat&rsquo; are massively
indeterminate, and both alternatives are absurd.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll proceed by first defining metaphysical realism,
illustrating its distinctive mind-independence claim with some
examples and distinguishing it from other doctrines with which it is
often confused, in particular factualism. We&rsquo;ll then outline the
Representation Problem in the course of presenting the anti-realist
challenges to metaphysical realism that are based on it. We discuss
metaphysical realist responses to these challenges, indicating how the
debates have proceeded, suggesting various alternatives and
countenancing anti-realist replies. We finish with a brief review of
recent realist/anti-realist debates in meta-ontology.</p>

<h2 id="WhaMetRea">1. What is Metaphysical Realism?</h2>

<p>
Metaphysical realism is the thesis that the objects, properties and
relations the world contains, collectively: the structure of the world
[Sider 2011], exists independently of our thoughts about it or our
perceptions of it. Anti-realists either doubt or deny the existence of
the structure the metaphysical realist believes in or else doubt or
deny its independence from our conceptions of it. Realists about
numbers, for example, hold that numbers exist mind-independently. This
view is opposed by Nominalists who deny the existence of abstract
objects and Intuitionists who agree numbers exist, but as mental
constructions, denying their mind-independence. Some realists about
laws of nature, to take an empirical example, hold that laws are
relations between universals [Armstrong 1983], others that laws are
ontologically primitive entities [Maudlin 2007]. Anti-realists about
laws of nature, on the other hand, either deny there are any laws at
all [Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989] or else discern a dependence
on human concepts in the nature of these laws, interpreting them as
expressing certain expectations we have about regularities that we
unconsciously project onto the world [Blackburn 1986].</p>

<p>
Metaphysical realism is not the same as scientific realism. That the
world&rsquo;s constituents exist mind-independently does not entail
that its constituents are as science portrays them. One could adopt an
instrumentalist attitude toward the theoretical entities posited by
science, continuing to believe that whatever entities the world
actually does contain exist independently of our conceptions and
perceptions of them. For the same reason, metaphysical realists need
not accept that the entities and structures ontologists posit exist
mind-independently.</p>

<p>
Henceforth, we shall often just use the term &lsquo;realism&rsquo; to
mean metaphysical realism. Opposition to realism can take many forms
so there is no single theoretical view denoted by the term
&lsquo;anti-realism&rsquo;. In particular, anti-realism is not
Idealism, even though Idealism is its most recognised form. One
approach, popular in Continental Philosophy, rejects realism on the
grounds that words can only acquire their meaning
<em>intra-linguistically</em>, through their semantic relations with
other words, where these relations are grounded in our linguistic and
cultural practices, rather than through referential relations to the
world outside of language. This view, Anti-Representationalism as it
is sometimes called, has gained traction in analytic philosophy also
[See Price 2009].</p>

<p>
Within the ranks of Analytic Philosophy, Verificationists and
Pragmatists also reject realism, though for different reasons. We
shall mainly focus in this entry on the types of criticism voiced by
these two groups of Analytic philosophers with Michael Dummett
advocating a certain kind of Verificationism and Hilary Putnam a
certain kind of Pragmatism. While accepting Representationalism, both
Dummett and Putnam rejected realism by deploying semantic
considerations in arguments designed to show that realism is
untenable. The main goal of this entry is to outline these
&lsquo;semantic&rsquo; challenges to realism and to critically
appraise them.</p>

<p>
The characterization of realism in terms of mind-independence above is
not universally accepted. Some object that mind-independence is
obscure [e.g. Chalmers 2009; for relevant discussion, see the entry
 <a href="../dependence-ontological/">ontological dependence</a>].
 Others maintain that realism is committed, in addition, to a
distinctive (and tendentious) conception of truth [Putnam 1981, 1985,
1992; Wright 1993; Button 2013; Taylor 2006] or, more radically, that
realism just is a thesis about the nature of truth&mdash;that truth
can transcend the possibility of verification, ruling statements for
which we can gather no evidence one way or the other to be
determinately either true or false. An example would be &ldquo;Julius
Caesar&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as he crossed the Rubicon.&rdquo;
Thus the realist on this view is one who believes the law of bivalence
(every statement is either true or false) holds for all meaningful
(non-vague) statements [Dummett 1978, 1991, 1993].</p>

<p>
In the same vein, Crispin Wright [1992a, 2003] presents a nuanced
alethic analysis according to which discourses may be more or less
realist depending on which distinctive &lsquo;marks of truth&rsquo;
they satisfy.</p>

<p>
These semantic formulations of metaphysical realism are unacceptable
to realists who are deflationists about truth, denying that truth is a
substantive notion that can be used to characterise alternative
metaphysical views [see the entry on the
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/">deflationary theory of truth</a>].
 Realists collectively complain, with some justice, that the
anti-realist arguments are really arguments against the correspondence
(or other substantive) theory of truth rather than realism [Devitt
1983, 1991; Millikan 1986]. This is an important reason for preferring
an ontological construal of realism rather than a semantic one.</p>

<p>
There is, in fact, an obvious worry about using the notion of
mind-independence to characterise realism: it appears to consign
mental states and events to irreality. Surely your savouring the taste
of espresso, say, is dependent on your mind if anything is? Moreover,
just as certainly the nature and content of the experience of tasting
espresso depends upon one&rsquo;s beliefs and expectations. Indeed,
but this is not what the &lsquo;mind-independence&rsquo;
characterisation of realism means to exclude. Rather, it is the
<em>existence</em> of conscious events that is deemed to be
independent of the particular opinions or theories we might hold about
their existence &mdash;given conscious events do exist, were our
descendants to uniformly dismiss them as illusory, they would be
mistaken. The &lsquo;mind-independence&rsquo; at issue is epistemic
rather than ontological.</p>

<p>
On this understanding of realism, it is an error to identify realism
with factualism, the view that sentences in some discourse or theory
are to be construed literally as fact-stating ones. The anti-realist
views discussed below are factualist about discourse describing
certain contentious domains. Adopting a non-factualist or
error-theoretic interpretation of some domain of discourse commits one
to anti-realism about its entities. Factualism is thus a necessary
condition for realism. But it is not sufficient. Verificationists such
as Dummett reject the idea that something might exist without our
being able to recognize its existence. They can be factualists about
entities such as numbers and quarks while anti-realists about their
nature since they deny any entities can exist mind-independently.</p>

<p>
To elaborate the notion of mind-independent existence, consider Peter
van Inwagen&rsquo;s argument for the existence of numbers [van Inwagen
2016], which he describes as &ldquo;a typical neo-Quinean
argument&rdquo;. The argument rests on two Quinean theses, van Inwagen
tells us. Firstly, that there is only one kind of variable, a variable
that occupies nominal position, the range of which is unrestricted.
Secondly, that the meanings of the quantifiers are
 univocal.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Given these two background assumptions, the argument he gives is
this:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>There are objects that have both mass and volume.</li>

<li>The average density of an object that has both mass and volume is
the ratio of its mass to its volume.</li>

<li>So, there is at least one thing that is a ratio.</li>

<li>Anything that is a ratio is a number.</li>

<li>Hence, there are numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>
(3) follows from (1) and (2), with the conclusion (5) deducible from
(1), (2) and (4). Moreover, both (2) and (4) are, if not analytically
true, simple mathematical truths. (1), on the other hand, is an
empirical fact, van Inwagen notes. The argument is clearly valid and
the three premises that support the conclusion are all highly
plausible. Should we not just accept that numbers exist? Many
philosophers think so but some philosophers demur. Amongst the latter
are those who think that the meaning of &lsquo;there exists&rsquo;
varies from context to context [Hilary Putnam and Eli Hirsch are two
prominent advocates whose ideas we review]. There are others who think
that the existential quantifier carries no ontological import
[Azzouni, J. 1997]. If one accepts Quine&rsquo;s two assumptions about
the existential quantifier, however, and regards the argument as
sound, hasn&rsquo;t one thereby accepted realism about numbers?</p>

<p>
No. For, while the argument establishes the existence of numbers, if
it is indeed sound, it leaves their nature unspecified. Hence, it does
not prove that numbers exist independently of human (or other) minds.
Moreover, since the inferences are intuitionistically valid,
anti-realists can accept it. The argument gives Intuitionists who
believe numbers are mental constructs just as much as Platonists who
believe they are eternal abstract objects a reason to believe numbers
exist.</p>

<h2 id="MinIndExi">2. Mind-Independent Existence</h2>

<p>
Why do some find the notion of mind-independent existence inadequate
for the task of formulating metaphysical realism? The most common
complaint is that the notion is either obscure, or, more strongly,
incoherent or cognitively meaningless. An eloquent spokesman for this
strong view was Rudolf Carnap: &ldquo;My friends and I have maintained
the following theses,&rdquo; Carnap announces [Carnap 1963,
p.868]:</p>

<ol>

<li>The statement asserting the reality of the external world
(realism) as well as its negation in various forms, e.g., solipsism
and several forms of idealism, in the traditional controversy are
<em>pseudo-statements</em>, i.e., devoid of cognitive content.</li>

<li>The same holds for the statements about the reality or irreality
of <em>other minds</em>.</li>

<li>For the statements of the reality or irreality of <em>abstract
entities</em> (realism of universals or Platonism, vs.
nominalism).</li>
</ol>

<p>
In spite of his finding these disputes meaningless, Carnap indicates
how he thinks we could reconstruct them (sic.) so as to make some
sense of them: if we were to &ldquo;replace the ontological theses
about the reality or irreality of certain entities, theses which we
regard as pseudo-theses, by proposals or decisions concerning the use
of certain languages. Thus realism is replaced by the practical
decision to use the reistic language&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Carnap does not have in mind a factualist reformulation of
metaphysical realism here&mdash;his &ldquo;reistic&rdquo; language is
strictly limited to the description of &ldquo;intersubjectively
observable, spatio-temporally localized things or events&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
What matters here is not Carnap&rsquo;s sense of a commensurability
between a metaphysical thesis about reality and a practical decision
to speak only about observable things, but rather that he thinks he
can explain how the illusion of meaningfulness arises for the
metaphysical theses he declares &ldquo;devoid of cognitive
content&rdquo;. His explanation has to do with a distinction between
two types of questions &mdash; <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em>
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
An existential statement which asserts that there are entities of a
specified kind can be formulated as a simple existential statement in
a language containing variables for these entities. I have called
existential statements of this kind, formulated <em>within</em> a
given language, <em>internal</em> existential statements. [Carnap
1963, p. 871]
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas internal questions about the existence of physical objects are
to be answered by observations that confirm or disconfirm sentences
asserting their existence, existential statements about abstract
objects are analytic, Carnap contends:</p>

<blockquote>
Just because internal statements are usually analytic and trivial, we
may presume that the theses involved in the traditional philosophical
controversies are not meant as internal statements, but rather as
<em>external</em> existential statements; they purport to assert the
existence of entities of the kind in question not merely within a
given language, but, so to speak, before a language has been
constructed. [1963, p. 871]
</blockquote>

<p>
Having dismissed all external existential questions as devoid of
cognitive content, Carnap decides that both realism which asserts the
ontological reality of abstract entities and nominalism which asserts
their irreality are &ldquo;pseudo-statements if they claim to be
theoretical statements&rdquo; (<em>ibid</em>).</p>

<p>
Where Carnap could make no sense of the notion of mind-independent
reality, Albert Einstein had no such difficulty. For, together with
Podolsky and Rosen, Einstein famously proposed a test for elements of
reality in their EPR paper [Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen 1935:
777&ndash;8]:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with
certainty (i.e. with probability equal to unity) the value of a
physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality
corresponding to this physical quantity</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Tim Maudlin [2014, p.7] explains the significance of the EPR criterion
thus:</p>

<blockquote>
Suppose &hellip; I can <em>without in any way disturbing a system</em>
predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity &hellip; then
the relevant element of reality obtained &hellip; <em>independently of
the determination being made</em>. Because, as we have said, the means
of determination did not (by hypothesis) disturb the system.
</blockquote>

<p>
Realists might wish to endorse the EPR criterion as an idealized test
for the mind-independent reality of (macro-)physical quantities
&mdash; even if we rarely (if at all) are able to &ldquo;predict with
certainty&rdquo; the outcome of an experiment, we can, some would
argue, approach near-certainty in a significant class of cases without
disturbing the system.</p>

<h2 id="AntReaChaMetRea">3. The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism</h2>

<h3 id="LanUseUnd">3.1 Language Use and Understanding</h3>

<p>
The first anti-realist challenge to consider focuses on the use we
make of our words and sentences. The challenge is simply this: what
aspect of our linguistic use could provide the necessary evidence for
the realist&rsquo;s correlation between sentences and mind-independent
states of affairs? Which aspects of our semantic behaviour manifest
our grasp of these correlations, assuming they do hold?</p>

<p>
For your representations of the world to be reliable, there must be a
correlation between these representations and the states of affairs
they portray. So the cosmologist who utters the statement &ldquo;the
entropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low&rdquo; has uttered a truth
if and only if the entropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low.</p>

<p>
A natural question to ask is how the correlation between the statement
and the mind-independent state of affairs which makes it true is
supposed to be set up. One suggestive answer is that the link is
effected by the use speakers make of their words, the statements they
endorse and the statements they dissent from, the rationalizations
they provide for their beliefs and actions and so forth; cognitively,
it will be the functional role of mental symbols in thought,
perception and language learning etc. that effects these links.</p>

<p>
However, when we look at how speakers actually do use their sentences,
anti-realists argue, we see them responding not to states of affairs
that they cannot in general detect but rather to agreed upon
conditions for asserting these sentences. Scientists assert &ldquo;the
entropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low&rdquo; because they all
concur that the conditions justifying this assertion have been
met.</p>

<p>
What prompts us to use our sentences in the way that we do are the
public justification conditions associated with those sentences,
justification conditions forged in linguistic practices which imbue
these sentences with meaning, anti-realists aver.</p>

<p>
The realist believes we are able to mentally represent
mind-independent states of affairs. But consider those cases where
everything that we know about the world leaves it unsettled whether a
relevant state of affairs obtains. Did Socrates sneeze in his sleep
the night before he took the hemlock or did he not? How could we
possibly find out? Yet realists hold that the sentence &ldquo;Socrates
sneezed in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock&rdquo; will
be true if Socrates did sneeze then and false if he did not.</p>

<p>
The Manifestation challenge to realism is to isolate some feature of
the use agents make of their words, or their mental symbols, which
forges the link between mind-independent states of affairs and the
thoughts and sentences that represent them. Nothing in the
thinker&rsquo;s linguistic behaviour, according to the anti-realist,
provides evidence that this link has been forged&mdash;linguistic use
is keyed to public assertibility conditions, not undetectable
truth-conditions. In those cases, such as the Socrates one, where we
cannot find out whether the truth-condition is satisfied or not, it is
simply gratuitous to believe that there is anything we can think or
say or do which could provide evidence that the link has been set up
in the first place. So the anti-realist claims [Dummett 1978, 1991,
1993; Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993].</p>

<p>
Why should we expect the evidence to be behavioural rather than, say,
neurophysiological? The reason anti-realists give is that the meanings
of our words and (derivatively for them) the contents of our thoughts
are essentially communicable and thus must be open for all speakers
and thinkers to see [Dummett 1978, 1993].</p>

<p>
Anti-realists contend there is nothing in cognitive or linguistic
behaviour that could provide evidence that people grasp what it is for
a sentence to be true in the realist&rsquo;s sense of
&lsquo;true&rsquo;. How can you manifest a grasp of a notion which can
apply or fail to apply without you being able to tell which? How could
you ever learn to use such a concept?</p>

<p>
One possible realist response is that the concept of truth is actually
very simple, and it is spurious to demand that one always be able to
determine whether a concept applies. As to the first part, it is often
argued that all there is to the notion of truth is what is given by
the formula &ldquo;&lsquo;<em>p</em>&rsquo; is true if and only if
<em>p</em>&rdquo;. The function of the truth-predicate is to disquote
sentences in the sense of undoing the effects of quotation&mdash;thus
all that one is saying in calling the sentence &ldquo;Yeti are
vicious&rdquo; <em>true</em> is that Yeti are vicious.</p>

<p>
It is not clear that this response really addresses the
anti-realist&rsquo;s worry, however. It may well be that there is a
simple algorithm for learning the meaning of &lsquo;true&rsquo; and
that, consequently, there is no special difficulty in learning to
apply the concept. But that by itself does not tell us whether the
predicate &lsquo;true&rsquo; applies to cases where we cannot
ascertain that it does. All the algorithm tells us, in effect, is that
if it is legitimate to assert <em>p</em> it is legitimate to assert
that &lsquo;<em>p</em>&rsquo; is true. So are we entitled to assert
&lsquo;either Socrates did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night
before he took the hemlock&rsquo; or are we not? Presumably that will
depend on what we mean by the sentence, whether we mean to be
adverting to two states of affairs neither of which we have any
prospect of ever confirming.</p>

<p>
Anti-realists follow verificationists in rejecting the intelligibility
of states of affairs that we cannot detect and tend to base their
rules for assertion on intuitionistic logic, which rejects the
universal applicability of the Law of Bivalence (the principle that
every statement is either true or false). This law is thought to be a
foundational semantic principle for classical logic. However, some
question whether classical logic requires bivalence [e.g. Sandqvist
2009]. Others dispute the idea that acceptance or rejection of
bivalence has any <em>metaphysical</em> (rather than
meaning-theoretic) consequences [Edgington, 1981; McDowell 1976; Pagin
1998; Gaiffman 1996]. There is, in addition, a question as to whether
the anti-realist&rsquo;s preferred substitute for realist
truth-conditions in verification-conditions (or proof-conditions)
satisfies the requirement of exhaustive manifestability [Pagin
2009].</p>

<p>
Perhaps anti-realists are right. But if so, they need to explain how a
practice based on a pervasive illusion can be as successful as modern
science. Anti-realists perturbed by the manifestability of realist
truth are revisionists not just about parts of our linguistic
practice, they are revisionists about our understanding of the world.
The consequence of this revisionist stance is that mathematics and
science require extensive and non-trivial revision. The debate about
whether classical logic should (or can) be rejected on
meaning-theoretic grounds is ongoing: Burgess 1984, Hellman 1989,
Michael 1999 and Read 2000 are critical of Dummett&rsquo;s case for
rejecting classical logic, whereas Cogburn 2005, Cozzo 1994, Prawitz
1977, 1987, 1994 and Tennant 1997 are, in varying degrees,
supportive.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most persuasive realist reply to Dummett&rsquo;s
manifestation challenge questions the need for epistemic access to
&lsquo;verification-transcendent&rsquo; states of affairs to
understand a sentence.  How do we understand a sentence like
&ldquo;Socrates sneezed in his sleep the night before he took the
hemlock&rdquo;? By understanding the sentence&rsquo;s component words
and their mode of composition. No epistemic confrontation with an
inaccessible past state of affairs is required given that we have
epistemic access to the semantic values of the sentence&rsquo;s
components and their mode of composition. That we do indeed understand
the truth-conditions associated with the Socrates sentence in the
realist way, as verification-transcendent ones, is manifest in our
acceptance of statements such as &ldquo;Socrates either sneezed in his
sleep the night before he took the hemlock or he did not,
independently of what anyone believes&rdquo;. Call this the
Compositionality Reply.</p>

<p>
Anti-realists respond to the Compositionality Reply by arguing that
all we make manifest by asserting things like &ldquo;Socrates either
sneezed in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock or he did
not, independently of what anyone believes&rdquo; is our pervasive
misunderstanding of the notion of truth. They apply the same diagnosis
to the realist&rsquo;s belief in the mind-independence of entities in
the world and to counterfactuals which express this belief. We
overgeneralize the notion of truth, believing that it applies in cases
where it does not, they contend [Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993].</p>

<p>
An apparent consequence of their view is that reality is indeterminate
in surprising ways&mdash;we have no grounds for asserting that
Socrates did sneeze in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock
and no grounds for asserting that he did not and no prospect of ever
finding out which. Does this mean that for anti-realists the world
contains no such fact as the fact that Socrates did one or the other
of these two things? No. For anti-realists who subscribe to
intuitionistic principles of reasoning, the most that can be said is
that there is no present warrant to assert \(S \lor \neg S\): that
Socrates either did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night before he
took the hemlock. Realists who endorse the Compositionality Reply may
counter that classical disjunction is the simplest projection from
concrete cases: we understand the disjunction by projecting from our
own case, for example: &ldquo;I am sneezing now or I am not sneezing now&rdquo;
[thanks, again, to the reviewer]. We return to this issue below in
&sect;3.2.</p>

<p>
Dummett contends that a speaker&rsquo;s understanding of meaning is
exhaustively manifested by certain recognitional abilities &mdash;
those that are exercised when determining whether the truth-conditions
of sentences are satisfied. Recent research, however, has cast doubt
on his claim, unearthing crucial semantic recognitional abilities that
are <em>not</em> manifest in use. Psychologists have tested
people&rsquo;s understanding of logical rules using university
students as their subjects for the last sixty years or so. Recently,
they have compared subjects&rsquo; responses to &lsquo;Control&rsquo;
syllogisms such as <em>All vehicles have wheels; Bikes are vehicles.
So, bikes have wheels</em> [De Neys 2014] with responses to
&lsquo;Conflict&rsquo; syllogisms like <em>All vehicles have wheels;
Boats are vehicles. So, boats have wheels</em>. The consistent finding
across hundreds of such studies has been that while most
university-educated subjects accept the Control syllogisms they
<em>reject</em> the Conflict ones, judging that the conclusion
&lsquo;boats have wheels&rsquo; does <em>not</em> follow from the
premises that <em>all vehicles have wheels</em> and <em>boats are
vehicles</em>. The studies seem to show that even highly educated
people are unaware of basic logical rules, particularly so when
subjects make no reference to these rules when quizzed about their
responses. Yet, Wim de Neys (2012) persuasively argued that a range of
more sophisticated measures suggest this may not be so. The measures
included ones for skin conductance showing increased autonomic arousal
when solving Conflict syllogisms; eye-tracking, showing increased
saccades to Conflict syllogism premises and conclusions compared to
those for Control syllogisms; higher activation of the anterior
cingulate cortex (an area known to be active in conflict detection)
for Conflict syllogisms; longer response latencies and decreased
response confidence when solving Conflict syllogisms as compared to
Control ones. De Neys concludes from these findings that while
subjects do indeed recognise logical rules, in most cases this
recognition is not sufficient to counter a strong bias to reject any
reasoning that leads to an obviously false conclusion: &ldquo;Hence,
although solving conflict problems might require abundant executive
resources, detecting the conflict is successful even for the most
biased reasoners.&rdquo; [ibid, p.31]</p>

<h3 id="LanAcq">3.2 Language Acquisition</h3>

<p>
The second anti-realist challenge to realism concerns our acquisition
of language. The challenge is for realists to explain how a child
could come to know the meanings of certain sentences within his/her
language: the ones which the realist contends have undetectable
truth-makers associated with them. How could the child learn the
meanings of such sentences if these meanings are determined by states
of affairs not even competent speakers can detect? In short,
competence in one&rsquo;s language would be impossible to acquire if
realism were true [Dummett 1978, 1993; Wright 1993]. This is the
Language Acquisition challenge.</p>

<p>
Consider the sentence (S) once more:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(S)</span> <span class="sen"> Socrates sneezed
in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Realists say (S) is either true or false even though we may (and
almost certainly will) never know which it is. The state of affairs
which satisfies (S)&rsquo;s truth-condition when it is true, its
&lsquo;truthmaker&rsquo;, and the state of affairs which satisfies the
truth-condition of the negation of (S) when (S) is false are supposed
to be able to hold even though competent speakers cannot detect
whether they do. How could the child ever learn about this
undetectable relation?</p>

<p>
A straightforward realist reply is, again, the Compositionality Reply
encountered in &sect;3.1&mdash; that knowledge of the meanings of
sentences with undetectable truth-conditions like (S) is acquired in
the same way as knowledge of the meanings of sentences with
recognisable truth-conditions: namely, compositionally by acquiring
knowledge of the lexicon and the relevant compositional principles
[Pagin
 2009].<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 While anti-realists contest the interpretation of the compositional
principles that generate sentences with undetectable truth-conditions
[where realists assert \(S \lor \neg S\) is true (<em>S</em> being the
Socrates sentence), anti-realists maintain there is no ground for
asserting this disjunction [e.g. Tennant 1987]], this does nothing to
show that the realist&rsquo;s classical disjunction is unlearnable
[thanks to a referee for emphasizing this point], and, as we saw in
&sect;3.1, there is a simple way in which it could be learned.</p>

<p>
The Acquisition challenge is exacerbated by the anti-realist&rsquo;s
assumption that since the linguistic meaning of an expression
<em>E</em> is determined solely by competent speakers&rsquo; use of
<em>E</em> the child&rsquo;s task in all cases is to infer or observe
the meaning of <em>E</em> from its use. Thus Dummett [1978 pp.
216&ndash;217], in discussing the meaning of mathematical statements,
proposes a thesis he argues holds for the meanings of every kind of
statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The meaning of a mathematical statement determines and is exhaustively
determined by its use. The meaning of a mathematical statement cannot
be, or contain as an ingredient, anything which is not manifest in the
use made of it, lying solely in the mind of the individual who
apprehends that meaning: if two individual agree completely about the
use to be made of the statement, then they agree about its meaning.
The reason is that the meaning of a statement consists solely in its
role as an instrument of communication between individuals, just as
the powers of a chess-piece consist solely in its role in the game
according to the rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
W.V.O. Quine is even more insistent on the public nature of linguistic
meaning. Displaying his unshakable faith in Skinnerian models of
language-learning he writes [1992, pp. 37&ndash;38]:</p>

<blockquote>
In psychology one may or may not be a behaviourist, but in linguistics
one has no choice &hellip; There is nothing in linguistic meaning
beyond what is to be gleaned from overt behaviour in observable
circumstances.
</blockquote>

<p>
Some realists reject the publicity of meaning principle as it applies
to language learning. While many accept that the meaning of a word is
determined by its use in a given language, not all do [e.g. Chomsky
1986; Fodor and Lepore 2002]. Realists who think of semantic
understanding as a mental state reject the idea that a speaker&rsquo;s
understanding of meaning is exhaustively manifest in its use <em>as an
instrument of communication</em>. They argue meaning is fixed by its
internal role in expressing thought. If Dummett&rsquo;s manifestation
requirement is a demand for a behaviouristic reduction of semantic
knowledge, they argue, it should be rejected [Burgess 1984; Chomsky
1986]. However, some sympathetic to the demand for full
manifestability of semantic knowledge reject the behaviouristic
construal and instead justify it on conceptual grounds [e.g. Shieh
1998, McGee
 2015].<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The Acquisition Challenge is a vexed one for realists to respond to
because Dummett shares little common ground with the many (realist)
philosophers, linguists and cognitive scientists who believe language
acquisition is effected by a dedicated language module [Fodor 1975,
1983, 2008; Chomsky 1986, 2006; Crain 2012; Pinker 1994] or even with
those who disavow modularity but agree that semantic knowledge is
partly unconscious. Thus, Dummett rejected Chomsky&rsquo;s thesis that
speakers have unconscious knowledge of the rules of Universal Grammar
on the Wittgensteinian grounds that it was, at best &ldquo;an
explanatory hypothesis, not a systematisation of facts open to
view.&rdquo; [Dummett 1981]. Dummett apparently took this
&ldquo;systemisation of facts&rdquo; to be satisfied by an account
that pairs knowledge of meaning with recognitional
 abilities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Evidence from developmental psychology indicates some meaning is
pre-linguistic and that some pre-linguistic meaning or conceptual
content relate to situations that are not detectable by the child. For
example, psychologists have discovered systems of core knowledge
activated in infancy that govern the representation of, <em>inter
alia</em> concrete objects and human agents [see Spelke 2003; Spelke
and Kinzler 2007]. An interesting finding from preferential gaze
experiments suggests 4 month old infants represent occluded objects as
continuing behind their
 barriers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
While these findings do not by themselves show that the meanings of
mental symbols is not determined by public use, they do provide
evidence that &lsquo;verification-transcendent&rsquo; conceptual
content is laid down in the earliest stages of cognitive
development.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that the anti-realist&rsquo;s model of disjunction
seems at odds with how we actually use disjunction. For it rules many
quite innocuous-looking disjunctions as unacceptable:</p>

<p>
We say of a coin to be tossed that (C) <em>The coin will either land
Heads or Tails</em> without having any idea which face it will land on
or of a lottery with one ticket to be drawn from a million tickets
that (L) <em>One of these tickets will be the winning ticket</em>
without wishing to say of any one ticket that it will win. In fact, it
is arguably the point of disjunction to allow speakers to convey
useful information about the number of live possibilities when they do
not know which of those possibilities does (or did or will) obtain.
Indeed, even when we can never find out which alternative holds or
held or will hold. Consider (D) <em>The number of dinosaurs on Earth
was either odd or even</em>. Most people hear (D) as a trivial truth.
Why? Presumably because if there were dinosaurs on earth, there must
have been a definite number of them, N say, where N is a positive
integer. But as all positive integers are either odd or even, N is
either odd or even. Yet, it is utterly unlikely that we could ever
know what positive integer N is. Hence, we&rsquo;ll (almost certainly)
never know whether the number N of dinosaurs that roamed our world was
an odd positive integer or an even one.</p>

<p>
Whence, disjunction provides a plausible method for a language learner
to acquire the notion of verification-transcendent truth. Just because
the disjunctions in (C) and (L) are assertible even though their
individual disjuncts are not (at the time of utterance or of
entertaining the disjunction in thought) and the disjunction (D) is
assertible even though we will never find out which disjunct holds, we
can come to grasp how a statement such as (O) <em>There were an odd
number of dinosaurs on earth</em> could be true without our ever being
able to verify it is. For, as (D) is true, it must either be that (O)
is true or else that (E) <em>There were an even number of dinosaurs on
earth</em> is true instead. Thus, either (O) or (E) is true, though
undetectably so.</p>

<h3 id="RadSke">3.3 Radical Skepticism</h3>

<p>
According to Hilary Putnam, the metaphysical realist subscribes not
just to the belief in a mind-independent world but also to the thesis
that truth consists in a correspondence relation between words (or
mental symbols) and things in that mind-independent world. Call this
thesis <em>correspondence truth</em> (after Devitt 1991). More
importantly, metaphysical realists aver that an ideal theory of the
world could be <em>radically</em> false, Putnam contends:
&lsquo;radical&rsquo; in the sense that <em>all</em> (or almost all)
of the theory&rsquo;s theses could fail to hold. Such a global failure
would result if we were to be &lsquo;brains-in-a-vat&rsquo;, our
brains manipulated by mad scientists (or machines, as in the movie
<em>The Matrix</em>) so as to dream of an external world that we
mistake for reality. Call this thesis <em>radical skepticism</em>.</p>

<p>
It is widely believed that states of affairs that are truly
mind-independent do engender radical skepticism. The skeptic contends
that for all we could tell we could be brains in a vat&mdash;brains
kept alive in a bath of nutrients by mad alien scientists, or, in
Putnam&rsquo;s preferred version, by super-computers so that there are
and never were any flesh and blood creatures as we imagine there to
be. All our thoughts, all our experience, all that passed for science
would be systematically mistaken if we were. We&rsquo;d have no bodies
although we thought we did, the world would contain no physical
objects, yet it would seem to us that it did, there&rsquo;d be no
Earth, no Sun, no vast universe, only the brain&rsquo;s deluded
representations of such. At least this could be the case if our
representations derived even part of their content from links with
mind-independent objects and states of affairs. Since realism implies
that such an absurd possibility could hold without our being able to
detect it, it has to be rejected, according to anti-realists.</p>

<p>
Putnam assays to prove that realism is not just false but internally
inconsistent. It is the goal of his Brain-In-A-Vat Argument to prove
not only that we are <em>not</em> brains in a vat but that we
<em>could not</em> be. When I talk of Putnam&rsquo;s Brain-In-A-Vat
Argument, <strong>BIVA</strong>, I shall mean his argument for the
modal thesis that we <em>could not be</em> brains-in-a-vat. Most
discussions of Putnam&rsquo;s Brain-In-A-Vat Argument focus instead on
the question of whether Putnam has shown that we are not BIVs. [I am
indebted to a SEP reviewer for emphasizing the need to focus on the
modal conclusion that <em>we could not be</em> brains-in-a-vat and for
helpful suggestions about arguments for this conclusion]. The
difficulty we face is that the only clear argument Putnam gives for
the modal conclusion is very brief and, as we shall see, a little
perplexing.</p>

<p>
A crucial assumption of the <strong>BIVA</strong> is semantic
externalism, the thesis that the reference of our words and mental
symbols is partially determined by contingent relations between
thinkers and the world. This is a semantic assumption many realists
endorse. To understand semantic externalism, it is useful to recall
the &lsquo;Twin-Earth&rsquo; considerations used to support it: on
Twin-Earth things are exactly as they are here on Earth except for one
difference&mdash;whereas for Earthly humans water has the chemical
composition H<sub>2</sub>O, for our d&ouml;ppelgangers on Twin-Earth,
twumans, water is instead composed of some substance unknown to us on
Earth, XYZ. Now when you and your twuman counterpart say (or think)
&ldquo;&lsquo;Water&rsquo; refers to water&rdquo; both of you utter
(or think) truths. But which truth you both think or utter differs.
For humans &ldquo;&lsquo;Water&rsquo; refers to water&rdquo; expresses
the truth that the term &lsquo;water&rsquo; in English refers to that
substance whose chemical composition is H<sub>2</sub>O. For our twuman
Twin-Earth counterparts, however, their sentence
&ldquo;&lsquo;Water&rsquo; refers to water&rdquo; expresses the truth
that their term &lsquo;water&rsquo; in Twenglish refers to that
substance whose chemical composition is XYZ.</p>

<p>
Now, according to Putnam, while the realist&rsquo;s mind-independence
thesis entails that we could indeed be brains in a vat, Externalism
entails that were we to be BIVs we could not even entertain this as a
possibility (since a BIV&rsquo;s thoughts are about virtual BIVs, not
BIVs). Putnam concludes that (externalist) realism is incoherent
[Putnam 1981]. For this argument to work, however, Putnam must be
assuming a rather restrictive form of modal rationalism: we could be
brains in a vat only if in the circumstance that we were envatted, we
could conceive that we were envatted. </p>

<p id="world-diagram">
There is, in fact, no <em>logical</em> incoherence in believing both
that (I) It is possible that one is a BIV and that (II) If one is a
BIV one could never conceive that one was &mdash;as the figure below
illustrates.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Four worlds: w* with not-v, Ev; and w', w'', w''' all with v and not-Ev. Each world is accessible from itself and w' is accessible from w* but only w'' and w''' are accessible from w'." src="figure.png" style="height:142px; width:312px" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure.</span> Consider a universe of 4 worlds.
If we are <em>not</em> in fact brains-in-a-vat (so that the hypothesis
<em>v</em> that we are brains in a vat is false, \(\neg v\) is true at
\(w^*\), the actual world) we can nonetheless entertain \((E)\), the
hypothesis that we are (so that \(Ev\) is true at \(w^*\)),
recognizing as we do so that were we to inhabit a world such as \(w'\)
in which we are brains-in-a-vat (<em>v</em> holds at \(w'\)), we would
lack the semantic resources to articulate thoughts reflecting our own
envatted state so that we <em>could not</em> so much as entertain the
thought that we were brains-in-a-vat (\(\neg Ev\) holds not only at
\(w'\) but at all those worlds ( \(w''\), \(w'''\)) accessible from
\(w'\)).</p>
</div>

<p>
Putnam&rsquo;s argument for realism being inconsistent does not seem
compelling. However, he offers another argument based upon Externalism
that seeks to prove we could not be brains-in-a-vat. This is his
<strong>BIVA</strong>. It rests upon the following reasoning: &ldquo;So, if
we are brains in a vat, then the sentence &lsquo;We are brains in a
vat&rsquo; says something false (if it says anything). In short, if we
are brains in a vat, then &lsquo;We are brains in a vat&rsquo; is
false. So, it is necessarily false.&rdquo; [1981, p.15]. Putnam apparently
thought he had proved by means of Externalism that we could not be
brains-in-a-vat. Has he? Suppose I worry that I might be a
brain-in-a-vat. Seeking reassurance that I could not be, I read
Putnam&rsquo;s words. I ponder the sentence &ldquo;If I am a brain-in-a-vat,
then the sentence &lsquo;I am a brain-in-a-vat&rsquo; is false&rdquo;. If
Externalism is true, I reason, then if I indeed am a brain-in-a-vat,
the pronoun &lsquo;I&rsquo; in my language (vat-English or v-English)
refers not to me but to <em>virtual</em> me, <em>v-me</em>, and the
term &lsquo;brain-in-a vat&rsquo; or &lsquo;BIV&rsquo; refers not to
real BIVs but to <em>v-BIVs</em>. That being so, the sentence &lsquo;I
am a brain-in-a-vat&rsquo; in v-English will mean that <em>v-me is a
v-BIV.</em> But that proposition is true, not false. I then
reconsider: perhaps the singular pronoun &lsquo;I&rsquo; refers to me
in every possible situation, whatever my nature? If so, then in the
circumstance that I am a BIV my utterance (or mental tokening) of
&lsquo;I am a BIV&rsquo; will mean that <em>I am a v-BIV</em>. That
proposition is false. But it is not the proposition Putnam is
discussing. The proposition Putnam thinks is necessarily false is the
proposition that <em>I am a BIV</em>. </p>

<p>
Is there then no valid argument in the spirit of Putnam&rsquo;s
<strong>BIVA</strong> which could be used to show that we could not be
brains-in-a-vat?</p>

<p>
Michael McKinsey has cleverly reworked Putnam&rsquo;s argument to show
against the sceptic that we are not (and we can know that we are not)
brains-in-a-vat. [His anti-skeptical argument, AS, in section 9 of his
Winter 2024 archived entry
 <a href="../skepticism-content-externalism/#SimpArgu">skepticism and content externalism</a>].
 Here, I adapt McKinsey&rsquo;s AS argument to formulate a revised
brain-in-a-vat argument, <strong>BIVA*</strong>. Consider the set of
worlds U wherein I am a denizen with much the same cognitive abilities
as I have now in the actual world @ such that in every world w of U, I
possess at least a modicum of logical acumen. The BIV hypothesis is
that I could be a brain-in-a-vat (a lab-grown computer-controlled
brain dreaming it is a human denizen of an external world experiencing
and thinking about that world in just the way that I experience and
think about it). Alternatively, I could be a computer simulation of a
human imagining that it is a human. Then: </p>

<ol>

<li>In any world w &isin; U, I understand that the proposition that I
have a body entails I am not a BIV.</li>

<li>Thus, in any world w &isin; U, I have the concept of a BIV.</li>

<li>Suppose that there is a world w&prime; &isin; U in which I am a
BIV.</li>

<li>Then, by (2), in w&prime; I have the concept of a BIV.</li>

<li>But, by Externalism, if I&rsquo;m a BIV in w&prime;, then in
w&prime; I do not have the concept of a BIV.</li>

<li>Hence, in w&prime; I both have and do not have the concept of a
BIV.</li>

<li>Therefore, there is no world w&prime; &isin; U in which I am a
BIV.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>BIVA*</strong> rests on the two assumptions of Minimal Logical
Acumen, and (Semantic) Externalism. Premise (2) seems correct: one
cannot grasp the proposition that one is not a BIV unless one has the
concept of a BIV. The MLA assumption guarantees I can recognize basic
entailments such as from the proposition that I have a body to the
proposition that I am not a BIV. Premise (5) rests on Externalism:
since BIVs are lab-grown computer-controlled brains or computer
simulations of humans who inhabit a virtual world in thought, BIVs
cannot refer in thought or word to real world brains or computer
simulations.Of course, the argument is only as good as its Externalist
assumptions and prominent realists such as Frank Jackson and David
Lewis follow Robert Stalnaker in rejecting Externalism for an
&lsquo;Internalist&rsquo; view of semantic content according to which
the content of a sentence is the set of possible worlds in which it is
true. Those realists who do accept Externalism and are swayed by the
McKinsey-styled argument <strong>BIVA*</strong>, on the other hand,
still owe us an explanation of how we can so much as grasp the
proposition that we are brains in a vat or virtual humans (if only to
reject it). Their answer will be that while all our evidence cannot
rule out this possibility, if Externalism is true there is no way the
world could have been wherein this possibility obtained. That is to
say, these realists believe that while it is <em>epistemically</em>
possible that we are brains-in-vats or virtual humans, it is not
<em>metaphysically</em> possible (if Externalism is true).</p>

<h3 id="ModRea">3.4 Models and Reality</h3>

<p>
Putnam&rsquo;s Model-Theoretic Argument is the most technical of the
arguments we have so far considered. We shall not reproduce all the
technicalities here. The central ideas can be conveyed informally,
although some technical concepts will be mentioned where necessary.
The argument purports to show that the Representation Problem&mdash;to
explain how our mental symbols and words get hooked up to
mind-independent objects and how our sentences and thoughts target
mind-independent states of affairs&mdash;is insoluble.</p>

<p>
According to the Model-Theoretic Argument, there are simply too many
ways in which our mental symbols can be mapped onto items in the
world. The consequence of this is a dilemma for the realist. The first
horn of the dilemma is that s/he must accept that what our symbols
refer to is massively indeterminate. The second horn is that s/he must
insist that even an ideal theory, whose terms and predicates can
demonstrably be mapped veridically onto objects and properties in the
world might still be false, i.e., that such a mapping might not be the
right one, the one &lsquo;intended&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Neither alternative can be defended, according to anti-realists.
Concerning the first alternative, massive indeterminacy for perfectly
determinate terms is absurd. As for the second, what can it mean for a
mapping to be the intended mapping if not that it satisfies every
conceivable operational and theoretical constraint? Yet Putnam&rsquo;s
Model-Theoretic Argument proves that there will invariably be
interpretations of an ideal theory on which all the theory&rsquo;s
sentences come out true which do satisfy any constraint we might
choose to impose on them, anti-realists maintain.</p>

<p>
Now, in logic theories are treated as sets of sentences and the
objects (if any) that sentences talk about appear as elements of the
domain of set-theoretic entities called <em>structures</em>.
Associated with these structures are <em>interpretation functions</em>
that map individual constants onto individual objects of the domain
and n-place predicates onto n-tuples of elements in the domain. When a
structure makes all the sentences of a given theory true it is called
a <em>model</em> of the theory. By demonstrating that there is a model
of T we show theory T is consistent. If T turns out to be true in its
<em>intended model</em>, then T is true <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For an informal illustration of the basic ideas of model theory, see
the supplementary document,
 <a href="model-theory.html">Model Theory: Core Ideas</a>.</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Let us call structures whose domains consist of numbers
&lsquo;numeric&rsquo; structures. The nub of Putnam&rsquo;s
Model-Theoretic Argument against realism is that the realist cannot
distinguish the intended model for his/her total theory of the world
from non-standard interlopers such as permuted models or ones derived
from numeric models, even when total theory is a rationally optimal
one that consists, as it must do, of an <em>infinite</em> set of
sentences and the realist is permitted to impose the most exacting
constraints to distinguish between models. This is a very surprising
result if true! How does Putnam arrive at it?</p>

<p>
Putnam uses several different arguments to establish the conclusion
above. The argument of prime concern to realists, as Taylor (2006)
emphasises, is the argument based on G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Completeness
Theorem, GCT. For, following Lewis [Lewis, 1984], realists might
concede to Putnam that they cannot single out the intended model or
distinguish it from various ersatz models, but argue that this is not
necessary since it suffices that an intended model <em>exists</em>,
even if we cannot specify it. This response does not answer the GCT
argument, however. For this argument purports to prove directly that
an ideal theory of the world could not be false, a conclusion flatly
inconsistent with realism. See the supplementary document
 <a href="model-theory-completeness.html">The Model-Theoretic Argument and the Completeness Theorem</a>
 for an outline of this argument.</p>

<p>
Putnam has another model-theoretic argument against realism, the
Permutation Argument, also designed to guarantee we can find a true
interpretation of an ideal theory:</p>

<p>
Suppose that the realist is able to somehow specify the intended
model. Call this intended model \(W''\). Then nothing the realist can
do can possibly distinguish \(W''\) from a permuted variant \(W^*\)
which can be specified following Putnam 1994b, 356&ndash;357:</p>

<blockquote>
We define properties of being a cat* and being a mat* such that:

<ol type="i">

<li>In the actual world cherries are cats* and trees are mats*.</li>

<li>In every possible world the two sentences &ldquo;A cat is on a
mat&rdquo; and &ldquo;A cat* is on a mat*&rdquo; have precisely the
same truth value.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead of considering two sentences &ldquo;A cat is on a mat&rdquo;
and &ldquo;A cat* is on a mat*&rdquo; now consider only the one
&ldquo;A cat is on a mat&rdquo;, allowing its interpretation to change
by first adopting the standard interpretation for it and then adopting
the non-standard interpretation in which the set of cats* are assigned
to &lsquo;cat&rsquo; in every possible world and the set of mats* are
assigned to &lsquo;mat&rsquo; in every possible world. The result will
be the truth-value of &ldquo;A cat is on a mat&rdquo; will not change
and will be exactly the same as before in every possible world.
Similar non-standard reference assignments could be constructed for
all the predicates of a language. [See Putnam 1985, 1994b.]</p>

<p>
Bas van Fraassen [1997] provides a concise informal sketch of
Putnam&rsquo;s Model-Theoretic Argument:</p>

<blockquote>
Let <em>T</em> be a theory that contains all the sentences we insist
are true, and that has all other qualities we desire in an ideal
theory. Suppose moreover that there are infinitely many things, and
that <em>T</em> says so. Then there exist functions (interpretations)
which assign to each term in <em>T</em>&rsquo;s vocabulary an
extension, and which satisfy <em>T</em>. So we conclude, to quote
Putnam, &ldquo;<em>T</em> comes out true, true of the world, provided
we just interpret &lsquo;true&rsquo; as TRUE(SAT)&rdquo;.
</blockquote>

<p>
Here &lsquo;TRUE(SAT)&rsquo; means &ldquo;true relative to a mapping
of the terms of the language of <em>T</em> onto (sets of) items in the
world&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Why should we interpret &lsquo;true&rsquo; as TRUE(SAT)? Because truth
is truth in an intended model and, Putnam argues, amongst all the
models of <em>T</em> that make all its theses come out true there is
guaranteed to be at least one that passes all conceivable constraints
we can reasonably impose on a model in order for it to be an intended
model of <em>T</em>.</p>

<p>
Realists have responded to the argument by rejecting the claim that a
model <em>M</em> of the hypothetical ideal theory <em>T</em> passes
every theoretical constraint simply because all of the theory&rsquo;s
theses come out true in it. For there is no guarantee, they claim,
that terms stand in the right relation of reference to the objects to
which <em>M</em> links them. To be sure, if we impose another
theoretical constraint, say:</p>

<blockquote>
Right Reference Constraint (RRC): Term <em>t</em> refers to object
<em>x</em> if and only if \(Rtx\) where <em>R</em> is the right
relation of reference,
</blockquote>

<p>
then <em>M</em> (or some model based on it) can interpret this RRC
constraint in such a way as to make it come out true. But there is a
difference between a model&rsquo;s making some description of a
constraint come out true and its actually conforming to that
constraint, metaphysical realists insist [Devitt 1983, 1991; Lewis
1983, 1984].</p>

<p>
Thus Devitt and Lewis claim that Putnam&rsquo;s alternative model
<em>M</em> has not been shown to satisfy <em>every</em> theoretical
constraint <em>merely</em> by making some description of each
theoretical constraint true.</p>

<p>
Skolem&rsquo;s Paradox in set theory seems to present a striking
illustration of Lewis&rsquo;s distinction between (re)interpreting a
constraint to make it come out true and genuinely satisfying that
constraint. The L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem Theorem states that every
consistent, countable set of first-order formulae has a denumerable
model, in fact a model in the set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Now in
ZF one can prove the existence of sets with a non-denumerable number
of elements such as the set \(\mathbb{R}\) of real numbers. Yet the ZF
axioms comprise a consistent, countable set of first-order formulae
and thus by the L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem Theorem has a model in
\(\mathbb{Z}\). So ZF&rsquo;s theorem \(\phi\) stating that
\(\mathbb{R}\) is non-denumerable will come out true in a denumerable
model \(\mu\) of ZF.</p>

<p>
How can this be? One explanation is that \(\mu\) makes \(\phi\) true
only at the cost of re-interpreting the term
&lsquo;non-denumerable&rsquo; so that it no longer means
<em>non-denumerable</em>. Thus \(\mu\) is not the intended model
\(M^*\) of ZF. It looks as if the metaphysical realist has a clear
illustration of Lewis&rsquo;s distinction at hand in set theory.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for the realist, this is not the only explanation. In
fact, Putnam used this very example in an early formulation of the
MTA. Just because there are different models that satisfy \(\phi\) in
some of which \(\mathbb{R}\) is non-denumerable but in others of which
(such as \(\mu\)) \(\mathbb{R}\) is denumerable, Putnam argued, it is
impossible to pin down the intended interpretation of
&lsquo;set&rsquo; via first-order axioms. Moreover, well before
Putnam, Skolem and his followers had taken the moral of Skolem&rsquo;s
Paradox to be that set-theoretic notions are indeterminate [For
further discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../paradox-skolem/">Skolem&rsquo;s paradox</a>].</p>
 
<p>
The question of how to interpret Skolem&rsquo;s Paradox merely raises
anew the question of what it is for a theory such as the hypothesized
ideal theory <em>T</em> to satisfy a right reference constraint,
(RRC). Putnam [1985] regards it as simply question-begging for a
realist to assume her notion of an intended model is determinate: i.e.
that terms such as &lsquo;satisfaction&rsquo; or
&lsquo;correspondence&rsquo; refer to those relations to which she
wishes them to refer. That her term &lsquo;refers&rsquo; refers to her
desired reference relation is &lsquo;just more theory&rsquo;. Realists
have responded that Putnam is wilfully re-interpreting their semantic
terms as he sees
 fit.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Is there some independent way to validate Lewis&rsquo;s distinction?
Michael Resnick thinks so [Resnick 1987]. Putnam maintained that
<em>M</em>, the model he constructs of the ideal theory <em>T</em>, is
an intended model because it passes every operational and theoretical
constraint we could reasonably impose. It passes every theoretical
constraint, he argues, simply because it makes every thesis of
<em>T</em> true. But unless the Reflection Principle
<strong>(RP)</strong> below holds, Resnick argues, this inference is
just a <em>non-sequitur</em>:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(<strong>RP</strong>)</span> <span class="sen">
To any condition <em>f</em> that a model of a theory satisfies, there
corresponds a condition <em>C</em> expressible in the theory that that
theory satisfies. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
However, this principle is false. The simplest counterexample to it,
Resnick points out, is Tarskian truth. Suppose we impose on
<em>T</em>&rsquo;s model <em>M</em> a condition \(f^*\) that
<em>M</em> makes all of <em>T</em>&rsquo;s theses come out true. Then,
unless <em>T</em> is either inconsistent or too weak to express
elementary arithmetic no truth predicate will be definable in
<em>T</em>. Whence there will be no condition <em>C</em> expressible
in <em>T</em> corresponding to this condition \(f^*\) on
<em>T</em>&rsquo;s model(s) <em>M</em>. Resnick concludes
(<em>ibid</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
Any true interpretation of <em>T</em> whatsoever&mdash;even one which
does not satisfy <em>C</em>&mdash;will make true every thesis of
<em>T</em>, including T&rsquo;s assertion that <em>C</em> is
satisfied. Which suffices to block the &lsquo;just more theory&rsquo;
gambit.
</blockquote>

<p>
The philosophical consensus appears to be that Lewis and Resnick are
right. Note that their argument, if sound, works against the
Permutation Argument also. Apart from the authors already discussed,
important criticisms of the MTA were advanced in Hale and Wright 1997,
van Cleve 1992 and Bays 2008. However, some very sophisticated
anti-realist attempts to buttress the Model-Theoretic Argument against
Lewis-styled criticisms have appeared. Igor Douven reconstructs
Putnam&rsquo;s argument, defending it against standard objections
[Douven 1999]. Barry Taylor presents a detailed explication and
defence of Putnam&rsquo;s Just More Theory reply [Taylor 2006], as
does Tim Button [Button 2013]. Whether these newer formulations of the
MTA succeed in answering the Lewis/Resnick objection is an open
 question.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ConSchPlu">3.5 Conceptual Schemes and Pluralism</h3>

<p>
According to conceptual pluralists, there can no more be an answer to
the question &ldquo;What is the structure of the world?&rdquo; outside
of some scheme for classifying entities than there can be an answer to
the question of whether two events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
simultaneous outside of some inertial frame for dating those events.
The objects that exist are the objects some conceptual scheme says
exists&mdash;&lsquo;mesons exist&rsquo; is true just because mesons
exist relative to the conceptual scheme of current physics.</p>

<p>
Realists think there is a unitary sense of &lsquo;object&rsquo;,
&lsquo;property&rsquo; etc., for which the question &ldquo;what
objects and properties does the world contain?&rdquo; makes sense. Any
answer which succeeded in listing all the objects, properties, events
etc. which the world contains would comprise a privileged description
of that totality [Putnam 1981]. Anti-realists reject this. For them
&lsquo;object&rsquo;, &lsquo;property&rsquo; etc., shift their senses
as we move from one conceptual scheme to another. Some anti-realists
argue that there cannot be a totality of all the objects the world
contains since the notion of &lsquo;object&rsquo; is <em>indefinitely
extensible</em> and so, trivially, there cannot be a privileged
description of any such totality. [For discussions of indefinite
extensibility see Dummett 1978, 1991; Linnebo 2018; Warren 2017].</p>

<p>
How does Putnam defend conceptual relativity? One way is by arguing
that there can be two complete theories of the world which are
descriptively equivalent yet logically incompatible from the
realist&rsquo;s point of view. For example, theories of space-time can
be formulated in one of two mathematically equivalent ways: as an
ontology of points, with spatiotemporal regions being defined as sets
of points; or as an ontology of regions, with points being defined as
convergent sets of regions. Such theories are descriptively equivalent
since mathematically equivalent and yet are logically incompatible
from the realist&rsquo;s point of view, Putnam contends [Putnam 1985,
1990]. Call the point based theory \(T_1\)and the region-based theory
\(T_2\).</p>

<p>
Anti-realists regard two theories as descriptively equivalent if each
theory can be interpreted in the other and both theories explain the
same phenomena. This judges \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) as descriptively
equivalent. Realists can accept the two theories are descriptively
equivalent. What the realist cannot accept is that \(T_1\) and \(T_2\)
are logically incompatible. Thomas William Barrett and Hans Halvorson
argue that the two theories &ldquo; &hellip; are simply convenient
ways of expressing the geometric facts that are more fully expressed
by a comprehensive theory&rdquo; that quantifies over both points and
lines. \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) cannot be incompatible according to Barrett
and Halvorson because they are in essence the <em>same</em> theory
[Barrett and Halvorson 2017]. This seems right: points exist in
\(T_2\) just as they do in \(T_1\). The two theories differ only in
their choice of theoretical primitives, not in their ontology. The
geometric case thus does not provide an instance of two theories that
are descriptively equivalent but logically incompatible (from the
realist&rsquo;s point of view). Realists deny the existence of such
theories.</p>

<p>
So, consider another Putnam-styled case [Putnam 2004]. Ernie looks
into his bag and sees there are 3 coins and nothing else and announces
&ldquo;There are exactly 3 objects in my bag.&rdquo; Maxi looks into
Ernie&rsquo;s bag and shakes her head &ldquo;No Ernie, there are 7
objects in your bag!&rdquo; she corrects him. The Carnapian pluralist
feels she can defuse the conflict and accommodate both points of view
by maintaining that whilst 3 objects exist-in-<em>E</em> (where
<em>E</em> is Ernie&rsquo;s everyday framework), 7 objects
exist-in-<em>M</em> (with <em>M</em> Maxi&rsquo;s mereological
framework). But even if Maxi can endorse both of these claims (since
the mereological objects include Ernie&rsquo;s 3 coins), it is not at
all certain Ernie can do so. If Ernie is unpersuaded that mereological
fusions of objects are themselves objects, then he may reject
Maxi&rsquo;s putative truthmaker for her framework-relative existence
claim &ldquo;7 objects exist-in-<em>M</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In this case, Maxi and Ernie do disagree about what exists. However,
the pluralist&rsquo;s suggestion that 3 objects exist-in-<em>E</em>
but 7 objects exist-in-<em>M</em> is not clearly warranted. There are
simpler explanations: one is that by &lsquo;object&rsquo; Ernie means
ordinary object, by &lsquo;object&rsquo; Maxi means mereological
object. Nothing deeper than that is required to explain their
disagreement. Rather than existence or truth that is relativized, the
meanings of their terms differ. On this account, pluralists have
mistaken a plurality of meanings for a plurality of modes of being.
However, other explanations are also possible: for instance, it may be
that Ernie and Maxi do mean the same thing by &lsquo;object&rsquo; but
hold incompatible theories about what counts as an object. More
importantly, as a reviewer noted, the debate <em>need not</em> turn on
the notion of an object: it can proceed with quantifiers, for example.
The disagreement then would arise from divergent interpretations of
those quantifiers.</p>

<p>
Putnam&rsquo;s pluralism has provoked very different reactions from
realists. Some argue that conceptual pluralism is consistent with
realism [Lynch 1998; Horgan and Timmons 2002; Sosa 2003], others take
Putnam&rsquo;s pluralism to amount to the claim that ontological
expressions are either indeterminate or that alternative ontologies
are equally good, both alternatives being problematic [Eklund 2008].
Realists cannot make sense of the Carnapian idea that existence and
truth are relative to a conceptual scheme [Brueckner 1998]. Peter van
Inwagen provides a trenchant criticism of Putnam&rsquo;s claims (remarks in 
square brackets added for clarification):</p>

<blockquote>
I cannot grant that &lsquo;Carnap&rsquo;s&rsquo; [Ernie&rsquo;s]
and &lsquo;The Polish logician&rsquo;s&rsquo; [Maxi&rsquo;s]
descriptions are equally good or equivalent descriptions of the
population of a world [e.g., the contents of Ernie&rsquo;s
bag]&mdash;not at least if Carnap&rsquo;s description is &lsquo;a
world that contains three mereological simples and nothing
else&rsquo;. I cannot grant that they <em>could</em> be &lsquo;equally
good or equivalent descriptions of the population of a world&rsquo;
since they are straightforwardly incompatible. (van
Inwagen 2002)
</blockquote>

<p>
Recently, however, some impressive neo-Carnapian defences of
conceptual pluralism have been proposed that bring new considerations
to bear on these debates. We briefly review some of these in section
4.</p>

<h2 id="ReaAntReaMetOnt">4. Realism and Anti-Realism in Meta-Ontology</h2>

<p>
Debates in meta-ontology (analytic ontology) over the last twenty
years have sparked renewed interest in realism. They have also seen a
marked shift in how realism, i.e. ontological realism, is understood.
&ldquo;The central question of metaontology&rdquo;, Theodore Sider, a
prominent ontological realist, contends, &ldquo;is that of whether
there are many equally good quantifier meanings, or whether there is a
single best quantifier meaning.&rdquo; [Sider 2009, p.397]. Where
Sider argues for a single best quantifier meaning, Eli Hirsch believes
there are a multiplicity of possible quantifier meanings that are
equally good, a thesis he calls <em>Quantifier Variance</em>. This
meaning-theoretic focus is something
 new.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It is no surprise, then, to find that the positions marked out as
&lsquo;realist&rsquo; and &lsquo;anti-realist&rsquo; by those engaged
in ontological disputes do not always coincide with realism and
anti-realism as we have explained these metaphysical
 views.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A more significant division is between metaontologists who accept a
<em>robust</em> conception of ontology, and <em>deflationists</em>
about ontology who don&rsquo;t. Sider defends robust ontology [Sider
2009, 385&ndash;386]:</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;ontological deflationists&rdquo;&hellip; have said &hellip;
when some particles are arranged tablewise, there is no
&ldquo;substantive&rdquo; question of whether there also exists a
table composed of those particles. There are simply different &mdash;
and equally good &mdash; ways to talk. I, on the other hand, accept a
very strong realism about ontology. I think that questions about the
existence of composite objects are substantive, just as substantive as
the question of whether there are extra-terrestrials.
</blockquote>

<p>
Neo-Carnapians such as Putnam, Eli Hirsch, David Chalmers, Amie
Thomasson, and Huw Price are ontological deflationists who embrace
conceptual pluralism about ontological matters. Hirsch, however,
thinks conceptual pluralism is perfectly consistent with realism
[Hirsch, E. 2002]. Matti Eklund understands Hirsch to mean that he
considers the world to be an amorphous lump [Eklund, M., 2008] (citing
Michael Dummett), a &lsquo;lump&rsquo; that alternative and equally
feasible conceptual schemes serve to make intelligible. For Sider, in
contrast, rejecting an intrinsic structure to the world is to reject
 realism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Competing views about temporal persistence do not seem to be semantic
in nature. While Perdurantists believe that things persist through
time by virtue of having temporal parts that <em>perdure</em>,
Endurantists reject the notion of temporal parts as incoherent
&mdash;things persist by <em>enduring</em>: they are wholly present
whenever they exist. As observed in the entry on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>:</p>
 
<blockquote>
This looks like a straightforward ontological disagreement, a dispute
about what exists.
</blockquote>

<p>
Eli Hirsch is not convinced, however:</p>

<blockquote>
I claim that the dispute between Endurantists and Perdurantists is
verbal &hellip; each party ought to agree the other party speaks a
truth in his own language. [Hirsch 2011, 229]
</blockquote>

<p>
How can this be? Endurantists think perdurantists are guilty of
spatializing time when they talk about temporal parts; perdurantists
think enduring objects cannot explain change. How can there be a
rapprochement of the sort Hirsch has in mind?</p>

<p>
Hirsch&rsquo;s novel and intriguing idea is that what makes the
endurantist/perdurantist temporal parts debate and the
nihilist/universalist mereological debate merely verbal ones is the
fact that the protagonists in these debates mean different things by
their quantifiers, in particular their existential quantifiers, in
their ontological assertions. While both protagonists speak a common
language, here English, in which certain ontological claims such as
&lsquo;there are tables&rsquo; happen to come out true, this is a
superficial socio-linguistic fact about English that might not have
been so: we and they could just as easily have spoken English* (an
ontological nihilist language) in which the sentence &lsquo;there are
tables&rsquo; came out false. Protagonists in these ontological
disputes are, unwittingly, engaged in a &lsquo;merely verbal&rsquo;
debate and are thus talking past each
 other.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
How does the deflationist tell that an ontological dispute is a
&lsquo;merely verbal&rsquo; one? Hirsch thinks that when we interpret
the words of another, we assign truth-conditions to their sentences by
matching those sentences with sets of possible worlds, guided by the
metasemantic maxim that the speaker&rsquo;s assertion of those
sentences should come out true. The maxim applies to ontological
disputes such as the Ernie/Maxi dispute about mereology &mdash; there
are possible languages in which both speakers&rsquo; assertions come
out true. Where a &lsquo;character&rsquo; of a sentence is a function
from contexts of utterance to truth-conditions, Hirsch contends:
&ldquo;speakers of either language should allow that speakers of the
other language assert sentences that have the same characters and the
same truth-values as they themselves assert&rdquo; [Hirsch 2009,
p. 242].</p>

<p>
In this way Ernie should attribute the same set of possible worlds
(intensions) to Maxi&rsquo;s sentence &lsquo;There are seven objects
in your bag&rsquo; as he associates with his own sentence &lsquo;There
are three objects in my bag&rsquo; and Ernie should interpret Maxi as
uttering a truth in so doing. Ernie and Maxi are asserting the very
same proposition but are using different words to express it. They
are, as a result, simply talking past each other.</p>

<p>
Hirsch&rsquo;s doctrine of quantifier variance QV dominates current
metaontological debate. Some have questioned whether interpreters on
one side of an ontological dispute can admit that the language of
those on the other side is possible. For to do so each interpreter
must be able to provide a Tarskian semantics for the other&rsquo;s
language. But an Endurantist won&rsquo;t be able to do this for the
Perdurantist&rsquo;s sentence such as &lsquo;Alice<sub>t</sub> is a
temporal part of Alice&rsquo; since the predicate &lsquo;is a temporal
part of&rsquo; has an empty extension in the Endurantist&rsquo;s
language [Hawthorne 2006; Eklund 2009]. Others suspect QV is an
internally unstable position: how can an Endurantist speaking her
language E allow that a sentence like &lsquo;Alice<sub>t</sub> is a
temporal part of Alice&rsquo; is a <em>true</em> sentence of the
Perdurantist&rsquo;s language P without admitting that there are
temporal parts [e.g. Hale and Wright 2009; Dorr 2014]? Warren 2015
provides a convincing QV response to this &lsquo;Collapse&rsquo;
argument. An important resource, containing papers by some of the
authors cited, is the collection of essays anthologised in Chalmers et
al 2009 [For background on mereology see the entry
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>
 and for discussion of whether there are composite objects, see the
entry
 <a href="../material-constitution/">material constitution</a>
 and the entry
 <a href="../ordinary-objects/">ordinary objects</a>].</p>
 
<p>
The meaning-theoretic focus on Quantifier Variance in metaontology
represents a fascinating development. The implications for ontological
realism are as yet undecided.</p>

<h2 id="Sum">5. Summary</h2>

<p>
We have considered a number of challenges to realism, the thesis that
the objects and properties that the world contains, its nature and
structure, exist independently of our conception or perception of
them. Historically, these challenges came from two camps: (1)
neo-verificationists led by Dummett who assimilate belief in
mind-independent world to a belief in a verification-transcendent
conception of truth which they profess to find unintelligible, and (2)
pragmatists and pluralists led by Putnam who also question the
intelligibility of the realist&rsquo;s mind-independent world but for
reasons independent of any commitment to verificationism. While
neo-verificationism today claims few adherents, within the ranks of
analytic ontologists, pluralism and Carnap&rsquo;s version of it in
particular, has enjoyed something of a revival. Today, perhaps the
most active and engaging debates about realism are meta-ontological
ones that involve neo-Carnapian pluralists and their ontological
realist opponents.</p>

<p>
Both the historical debate between realists and their anti-realist
opponents and the meta-ontological debate are still very much open. If
realists could provide a plausible theory about how correspondences
between mental symbols and the items in the world to which they refer
might be set up, many of these challenges could be met. Alternatively,
if they could explain how, consistently with our knowledge of a
mind-independent world, no such correspondences are required to begin
with, many of the anti-realist objections would fall away as
irrelevant. In the absence of such explanations it is still entirely
reasonable for realists to believe that the correspondences are in
place, however, and there can, indeed, be very good evidence for
believing this. Ignorance of Nature&rsquo;s reference-fixing mechanism
is no reason for denying it exists.</p>
