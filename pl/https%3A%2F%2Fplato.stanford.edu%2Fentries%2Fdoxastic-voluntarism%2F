<h1>Doxastic Voluntarism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 1, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Doxastic voluntarism is the thesis that our beliefs are subject to
voluntary control. While there&rsquo;s some controversy as to what
&ldquo;voluntary control&rdquo; amounts to (see
 <a href="#WhiKinCon">&sect;1.2</a>),
 it&rsquo;s often understood as direct control: the ability to bring
about a state of affairs &ldquo;just like that&rdquo;, without having
to do anything else. Most of us have direct control over, for
instance, bringing to mind an image of a pine tree. Can one, in like
fashion, voluntarily bring it about that one believes a specific
proposition? Doxastic voluntarists hold that, at least in some
circumstances&mdash;such as when the evidence is ambiguous&mdash;we
can. Doxastic <em>in</em>voluntarists, in contrast, maintain that we
cannot. Some involuntarists hold that the concept of belief itself
precludes the possibility of believing voluntarily. Others hold that
the impossibility of voluntary belief is a contingent psychological
fact. Historically, the issue of doxastic voluntarism has been
connected to how many think about religious commitment: a prominent
view of faith is that it is a voluntary decision to believe.
Furthermore, the issue of voluntarism has also been viewed as having
bearing on fundamental questions in epistemology. For example, are
epistemic norms duties to believe in certain ways? Are there practical
or moral reasons to believe? If the answer to either question is
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it seems some measure of voluntary doxastic control
is required.</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#WhaDoxVol">section 1</a>,
 we expand on the definition of doxastic voluntarism, and survey
various kinds of control (e.g., direct, indirect, long-range) and the
doxastic attitudes we might control (e.g., outright belief,
withholding, credences). In
 <a href="#His">section 2</a>,
 we discuss a number of historical views on doxastic voluntarism. In
 <a href="#ArgForInv">section 3</a>,
 we survey motivations for rejecting doxastic voluntarism. There are
two general strategies: arguments that appeal to psychological
considerations, and conceptual arguments regarding the nature of
belief. In
 <a href="#DefVol">section 4</a>,
 we survey five approaches to defending voluntarism: those that appeal
to epistemic permissivism, doxastic compatibilism, skepticism, one-off
considerations, and non-standard views of belief. In
 <a href="#EmpWorVol">section 5</a>,
 we cover empirical work on doxastic voluntarism. The last two
sections discuss two implications of voluntarism. In
 <a href="#EthBel">section 6</a>,
 we discuss voluntarism&rsquo;s implications for the ethics of belief,
and in
 <a href="#RelFai">section 7</a>,
 we discuss issues at the intersection of voluntarism and religious
faith.</p>

<h2 id="WhaDoxVol">1. What is Doxastic Voluntarism?</h2>

<h3 id="VarCon">1.1 Varieties of Control</h3>

<p>
As we have said, doxastic voluntarism is the thesis that our beliefs
are under our voluntary control, or that we can believe at will
(following current conventions, we will use &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;
belief and belief &ldquo;at will&rdquo; interchangeably). Doxastic
voluntarism is an existential claim: the view that at least
<em>some</em> of our beliefs are voluntary. Involuntarism, then, is
the view that none of our beliefs are voluntary. Thus, it&rsquo;s a
universal claim, and as such, it is quite strong and well-specified.
Voluntarism is then a weaker claim, and allows for a spectrum of
views: one belief is voluntary to all beliefs are voluntary. This
raises what one might call the <em>scope question</em>: which beliefs
can we actually control voluntarily? We return to this question in
 <a href="#OneOffVol">section 4.4</a>.
 (Almost all contemporary authors reject the view that <em>all</em>
beliefs are voluntary, but the view may have historical precedent; see
Frederick 2013 and Boespflug 2023.) In this section, we discuss two
key aspects of this definition: &ldquo;voluntary control&rdquo; and
&ldquo;belief&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Those working on doxastic voluntarism distinguish various kinds of
voluntary control; here, we follow the basic contours of William
Alston&rsquo;s (1988) influential taxonomy. Alston distinguishes four
kinds of control. The first variety of control is what Alston calls
&ldquo;basic voluntary control&rdquo;; this has come to be known in
the literature as <em>direct control</em>. If one has direct control
over &Phi;-ing, one has the ability to &Phi; &ldquo;right away&rdquo;
or &ldquo;just like that&rdquo;, via an uninterrupted voluntary act
(Alston 1988: 263); in our terms, direct control implies <em>temporal
immediacy</em> and <em>causal basicality</em>. Most humans have direct
control over imaging a pink elephant: we can bring such an image to
mind right away, via an act of will, merely by deciding to do so.</p>

<p>
Alston&rsquo;s second kind of control is &ldquo;non-basic immediate
control&rdquo;: the kind of control we have over &ldquo;opening a
door, informing someone that <em>p</em>, or turning on a light&rdquo;
(Alston 1988: 269). While Alston refers to this kind of control as
&ldquo;direct&rdquo; (1988: 278), many writing on doxastic voluntarism
today would categorize it as <em>indirect control</em>, as it requires
more than a volition. Rather, some degree of cooperation from the
world is required to open a door and turn on the lights: the door must
swing properly on its hinges, the electricity must be flowing through
the wire. To give a doxastic example, you have non-basic immediate
control over your belief about the first word on page 3 of a book you
are holding; assuming the world cooperates, you can easily open the
book, read the word, and form the relevant belief. Thus, non-basic
immediate control allows us to bring about something &ldquo;just like
that&rdquo;, assuming the external conditions hold. It is
<em>immediate</em> in the sense that the end can be achieved
&ldquo;just like that&rdquo; in a single voluntary act, rather than
working toward the end over time, interspersed with actions directed
at accompanying goals (Alston 1988: 269).</p>

<p>
A third kind of control, according to Alston, is &ldquo;long range
voluntary control&rdquo;. We have this sort of control over things
like learning to play an instrument, getting in shape to run a
marathon, lowering our blood pressure, and altering certain of our
dispositions. We can set out on an intentional, long-term project to
change these things with some hope of success, by performing actions
over a longer period of time, interrupted by activity directed at
other goals (Alston 1988: 275). In the belief case, it&rsquo;s
plausible that at least sometimes, we can change what we believe over
time by changing the evidence we pay attention to, the sources we
read, the people we spend time with, and the like. The probability
that these long-term intentional projects will be successful varies;
in some cases, the likelihood of success may be quite high; however,
in other cases, even the most sincerely committed are unlikely to
succeed.</p>

<p>
This brings us to Alston&rsquo;s final variety of control,
&ldquo;indirect influence&rdquo; over belief. The clearest way to
distinguish long range control from indirect influence is that the
former requires an intention to form a specific belief, and the latter
does not. Our beliefs can be influenced unintentionally in a variety
of ways: acts that form our character and virtues, sources of evidence
that we expose ourselves to, time spent reflecting (or not). All of
these, in turn, affect what we believe. For example, I may decide to
spend time with relatives that have different political viewpoints;
this may have the indirect (and unintentional) consequence of
increasing the likelihood that my own political views will change.
There are, furthermore, a wide variety of cognitive dispositions one
can cultivate that similarly influence belief; pursuing things like
open mindedness, curiosity, and careful reflection on evidence can
influence one&rsquo;s beliefs over time, even without an intentional
attempt to change one&rsquo;s attitude toward a particular
proposition.</p>

<p>
Alston further seems to suggest that influence may also involve an
intention to form a target belief (1988: 279). This is perhaps
because, in some cases, we may intend to change a belief, but our
chance of successfully doing so is low. The classic example is the
individual persuaded by Pascal&rsquo;s Wager, who, nonetheless, is
unable to simply decide to adopt theistic belief. Consequently, he
follows Pascal&rsquo;s advice to attend mass and take holy water
(1670), but this may nevertheless fail to guarantee the acquisition of
theistic belief. This spotty and unreliable long-range jurisdiction
may be more accurately described as influence, rather than full-blown
control.</p>

<h3 id="WhiKinCon">1.2 Which Kind of Control?</h3>

<p>
Which of these kinds of control is important for doxastic voluntarism?
It&rsquo;s widely accepted that we have some degree of indirect
control over our beliefs: we can influence, and even in some cases
control and change, our beliefs by changing the things we read, the
sources we watch, who we hang out with, and what evidence we pay
attention to. So many authors take doxastic voluntarism to be a thesis
about <em>direct control</em>: the view that beliefs can be brought
about immediately, in an uninterrupted intentional act (Audi 2001: 93;
Nottelmann 2007: 99; McHugh 2012b; Buckareff 2014; Nottelmann et al.
2023). Direct control is a robust and clear species of control (see
Mele 2017), so many authors focus there. The possibility of direct
<em>doxastic</em> control, however, is controversial (and in fact,
widely rejected by contemporary authors). Many of these authors think
even non-basic immediate control isn&rsquo;t sufficient for doxastic
voluntarism.</p>

<p>
However, simply because indirect doxastic control is uncontroversial
doesn&rsquo;t force us to equate voluntary believing with exercising
direct control. We might instead take doxastic voluntarism to be about
the <em>parity of belief and action</em>: that is, we have the same
kind of control over our beliefs that we do over our voluntary actions
(Steup 2008; Roeber 2019). One benefit of this view is that doxastic
voluntarism won&rsquo;t hang on difficult and controversial questions
about the metaphysics of free will (e.g., whether libertarianism or
compatibilism is true; see Steup 2017: 2674; Roeber 2019:
839&ndash;840).</p>

<p>
On a related view, voluntary belief is intentional belief, so doxastic
voluntarism is the view that we can believe <em>intentionally</em>
(Scott-Kakures 1994; Steup 2012; Peels 2017: 58). Other philosophers
think something even more specific is required for voluntary belief:
the ability to believe intentionally <em>for a practical reason</em>
(Hieronymi 2006, 2009; Setiya 2008; Buckareff 2014). One benefit of
this view is that it seems to capture the idea that voluntary beliefs
and voluntary actions should be similar (as the parity thesis does)
while remaining specific about the kind of doxastic control required.
On the other hand, if voluntary belief requires believing
intentionally for a practical reason, this seems like a particularly
(perhaps unnecessarily) strong form of voluntarism. Yet other authors
hold that the ability to believe intentionally for an
<em>epistemic</em> reason would be sufficient for the truth of
doxastic voluntarism (see Steup 2008). Feldman (2001: 85) has raised a
worry about the possibility of intentional belief: if we don&rsquo;t
have voluntary control over our intentions, even the ability to
believe intentionally may not render belief itself voluntary (see also
McHugh 2012a; Flowerree 2017). In response, Steup has pointed out that
if intentional belief isn&rsquo;t sufficient for voluntary belief,
then many of our seemingly voluntary actions actually wouldn&rsquo;t
be voluntary either (2008: 382).</p>

<p>
In sum, while philosophers generally agree that doxastic voluntarism
is about voluntary belief, there isn&rsquo;t a consensus about what
exactly &ldquo;voluntary control&rdquo; amounts to. And it&rsquo;s
possible that beliefs are voluntary in some of the senses noted above,
but not others.</p>

<h3 id="WhiAtt">1.3 Which Attitudes?</h3>

<p>
Now we turn to the question: what kinds of attitudes are relevant to
doxastic voluntarism? First, let&rsquo;s consider what attitudes
doxastic voluntarism is <em>not</em> about. Doxastic voluntarism is
not the view that we have voluntary control over <em>accepting</em>
that <em>p</em> (acting as if <em>p</em> is true) or
<em>committing</em> to <em>p</em>. Acceptance and commitment are both
taken to be a species of action, or at least action-like, and
it&rsquo;s widely recognized that you can act as if <em>p</em> even if
you don&rsquo;t believe <em>p</em> (for example: because of politeness
or high stakes). Some authors have argued that apparent cases of
voluntary belief are actually cases of voluntary acceptance or
commitment (Alston 1988: 267; Audi 2001; Buckareff 2004; Proust 2012;
Tebben 2018). Doxastic voluntarism is also not a thesis about
<em>stances</em> (in Van Fraassen&rsquo;s 2002 sense); stances are
clusters of attitudes and commitments which may involve, but go beyond
beliefs; for example, a commitment to empiricism (see also Fleisher
2018; Elder 2019). Finally, doxastic voluntarism isn&rsquo;t about
<em>alief</em>: an innate or habitual response to a stimulus, such as
our hesitancy to walk on the glass floor at the top of a tall
building, even though we believe (and even know) that it&rsquo;s safe
(Gendler 2008: 634).</p>

<p>
What attitudes are relevant, then? The first and most obvious is
outright belief: if one can bring oneself to believe <em>p</em>
voluntarily, then doxastic voluntarism is true. On some views,
voluntarily believing <em>p</em> is called &ldquo;judging&rdquo; that
<em>p</em> (Williamson 2000: 10; Roeber 2019, although the term
&ldquo;judgment&rdquo; is not univocal; see, e.g., Walker 1996; Shah
&amp; Velleman 2005: 503). A second attitude is withholding belief:
moving from believing <em>p</em> to being undecided on whether
<em>p</em>. We may have more control over giving up a belief (via
doubt, <em>&agrave; la</em> Descartes (Davies 2001: 113;
Sch&uuml;ssler 2013: 155&ndash;7)) than we have over forming a belief.
This is a legitimate, albeit limited, way of understanding doxastic
control (see Frederick 2013). A final species of doxastic voluntarism
worth mentioning is <em>credal voluntarism</em>, or voluntary control
over <em>credence</em>. Credence (or confidence) is the subjective
probability of a proposition, measured on a scale from [0,1]. For
example, while I both believe \(1+1=2\) and that it will rain
tomorrow, my credence in the former is 1, whereas my credence in the
latter is 0.85. While most authors writing on doxastic voluntarism
tend to focus on outright belief, there&rsquo;s a separate (and
underexplored) question of whether we have voluntary control over our
credences (see Wolterstorff 2010; Jackson 2019, forthcoming; Gao 2019;
Staffel 2019).</p>

<h2 id="His">2. History</h2>

<h3 id="Ant">2.1 Antiquity</h3>

<p>
Endorsements of doxastic voluntarism reach back at least to the Roman
Stoics. Epictetus (d. 135 CE) is recorded in the <em>Enchiridion</em>
as claiming that among the phenomena that are &ldquo;in our
power&rdquo; or &ldquo;up to us&rdquo; (&#7952;&phi;&rsquo;
&#7969;&mu;&#8150;&nu;) is &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;
(&#8017;&pi;&#972;&lambda;&eta;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;). His summary of
the types of things that are in our power as &ldquo;whatever are our
own acts&rdquo; suggests his conceiving of opinion as a species of
action. &ldquo;Opinion&rdquo; among the Stoics is a species of
&ldquo;assent&rdquo;
(&sigma;&upsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#940;&theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;)
which may be given (or not) to impressions, or the way things appear
to us (Vogt 2012: 651). In his <em>Discourses</em>, Epictetus treats
assent as subject to voluntary control (3.12.14). Though this aspect
of Epictetus&rsquo; thought is largely undeveloped, it suggests an
expansive conception of direct doxastic control&mdash;wherein one is
consistently at liberty to assent (or not) to the way things
appear.</p>

<p>
Epictetus&rsquo; position stands in stark contrast to that of
Aristotle, who 400 years earlier asserted the opposite in a passing
remark in <em>On the Soul</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[I]magining lies within our own power whenever we wish&hellip;but in
forming opinions we are not free: we cannot escape the alternative of
falsehood or truth. (III.427b20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Though it is difficult to know exactly how to interpret this last
clause, Aristotle does subsequently make clear that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
opinion involves belief (for without belief in what we opine we cannot
have an opinion)&hellip;. [E]very opinion is accompanied by belief.
(III.428a20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The role of the will in belief formation that would later emanate out
of the early Christian tradition gave rise to a rather different form
of voluntarism than that found in stoic authors. In keeping with the
New Testament&rsquo;s emphasis upon faith as apparently involving a
decision to believe or trust
(&pi;&#8144;&#769;&sigma;&tau;&#8144;&sigmaf;), faith would be thought
of as a voluntary action as early as Clement of Alexandria
(150&ndash;215): &ldquo;Faith&hellip;is in fact preconception by the
will, an act of consenting to religion&hellip;&rdquo;
(<em>Stromateis</em> II.2). Within this tradition, voluntary control
over belief would be thought of as exercised in believing in the truth
of things <em>unseen</em>, in keeping with the cardinal
characterization of faith offered in Hebrews 11:1: &ldquo;Now faith is
confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not
see&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In the influential thought of Augustine of Hippo (354&ndash;430), the
role of the voluntary belief operative in faith comes to occupy a
defining place not only for the layperson, but also for the
philosophical theologian. Encapsulated in his memorable aphorisms,
e.g., &ldquo;we must believe before we understand&rdquo; (<em>De
Trinitate</em> VIII.v.8; also, <em>Liberum Arbitrium</em> i.3;
<em>Confessions</em> vi.7)&mdash;later appropriated and adapted by
Anselm of Canterbury (d. 1109): &ldquo;I believe so that I may
understand&rdquo; (<em>Proslogion</em> I)&mdash;we find that faith and
belief are critical prerequisites for understanding and knowledge. In
order to understand profound theological truths, one must first
resolve to believe the testimony of Scripture (Boespflug 2016).</p>

<h3 id="MidAge">2.2 Middle Ages</h3>

<p>
Augustine&rsquo;s conception of faith would shape how many
philosophers and theologians would conceive of doxastic control in the
Latin West throughout the Middle Ages. Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;
(1225&ndash;1274) fullest discussions of doxastic control, for
instance, appear in his treatments of faith (<em>Summa Theologiae</em>
IIaIIae.1&ndash;7; <em>De Veritate</em> 14.1&ndash;2), as do William of
Ockham&rsquo;s (1285&ndash;1347) (e.g., <em>Quaestiones Variae</em>
q.5 p.186 in <em>Opera Theologica</em> vol. 8). For Aquinas, the will,
motivated by the good of eternal beatitude, &ldquo;commands
(<em>coactus</em>) the intellect to assent&rdquo; to the articles of
faith (<em>Summa Theologiae</em> IIaIIae 5.2; IaIIae.1.8). In article
1 of question 14 of <em>De Veritate</em>, entitled &ldquo;What is
Belief?&rdquo; he even appears to maintain that belief <em>in
general</em> is voluntary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Sometimes&hellip;the understanding can be determined to one side of a
contradictory proposition neither immediately through the definitions
of the terms&hellip;nor yet in virtue of principles&hellip;. And in
this situation our understanding is determined by the will, which
chooses to assent to one side definitely and precisely because of
something which is enough to move the will, though not enough to move
the understanding (<em>intellectus</em>)&hellip;. And this is the
state of one who believes (<em>credere</em>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The insinuation, here, that all belief is voluntary is confirmed
elsewhere, but does not imply that all belief-like states are
voluntary for Aquinas. For he claims that since knowledge
(<em>scientia</em>) compels assent&mdash;depriving the will of a
choice in assenting&mdash;it also thereby excludes belief (<em>Summa
Theologiae</em> IIaIIae.1.5; IIaIIae.2.5). (In keeping with
Aquinas&rsquo; insistence that belief [i.e., <em>credere</em>] and
knowledge are mutually exclusive, <em>credere</em> may be better
translated &ldquo;trust&rdquo; or &ldquo;to trust&rdquo; [Boespflug
2021b].)</p>

<p>
In spite of voluntarism remaining the dominant position on doxastic
control throughout the Middle Ages in the Latin West, there were also
expressions of involuntarism, and involuntarist conceptions of faith.
The eminent fourteenth century English Dominican Robert Holcot
(1290&ndash;1349) would give both psychological and conceptual
arguments against the possibility of voluntary belief. Conspicuously
contradicting Aquinas, he would maintain that even in cases of
ambiguous evidence our experience of our own psychology reveals that
we <em>cannot</em>, by virtue of an act of the will, believe
voluntarily:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For to me, it appears that every man, who does not want to obstinately
deny sense, experiences in himself (<em>experitur in seipso</em>) that
he cannot by command of the will determine himself to assent to one
side of a contradiction, when both are open to question for him.
(<em>Sex Articuli</em> ii.91; translated by author)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In such cases, one is compelled to suspend judgment. In fact, Holcot
holds that the very notion of voluntary belief yields a
contradiction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I argue that it is not in the power of man to make something appear to
be in reality completely as a proposition denotes. Therefore, it is
not in the power of man to make a proposition appear to him true; nor,
as a consequence, that he believes that to be true. For man cannot
believe some proposition to be true unless it appears to him true; nor
something appear to him true unless it appears to him, thus, to be
just as that proposition denotes. If, therefore, it would be in the
power of man to believe a proposition proposed to him, for which,
also, he does not have a compelling reason, it would be in man&rsquo;s
power to make a thing appear to him just as he wants. And, thus, there
is a contradiction: I believe that this proposition is true, and that
proposition does not appear to me to be true. (<em>Quaestiones super
Sententiarum</em> I.1 [L 2vb; M 3ra; translated by author])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet Holcot, at the same time presciently maintains that we may
exercise some voluntary control over belief &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo;
(<em>indirecte</em>) (<em>Sex Articuli</em> ii.92; see also Boespflug
2018).</p>

<h3 id="EarModPer">2.3 Early Modern Period</h3>

<p>
History&rsquo;s most famous doxastic voluntarist, Ren&eacute;
Descartes (1596&ndash;1650), would, like the Stoics he admired, treat
assent as a species of action.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he will [possesses the] ability to do (<em lang="la">facere</em>)
or not do something (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue or
avoid)&hellip;. If&hellip;I simply refrain from making a judgment in
cases where I do not perceive the truth with sufficient clarity and
distinctness, then it is clear that I am behaving correctly (<em lang="la">recte
agere</em>) and avoiding error. But if in such cases I
either affirm or deny, then I am not using my free will correctly (<em lang="la">libertate
arbitrii non recte utor</em>) (&ldquo;Fourth
Meditation&rdquo; of <em>Meditations</em>, AT VII:57&ndash;60; CSM
II:40&ndash;1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Conceiving of assent in this way enables Descartes to ascribe full
responsibility to agents&mdash;rather than God&mdash;for their
erroneous beliefs. His doxastic voluntarism, on this account, is the
keystone of the Fourth Meditation&rsquo;s free will response to the
so-called epistemological problem of evil.</p>

<p>
Descartes retains this conception of belief throughout his career. In
his late <em>Comments on a Certain Broadsheet</em>, he claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For I saw that over and above perception, which is a prerequisite of
judgment, we need affirmation and negation to determine the form of
the judgment, and also that we are often free to withhold our assent,
even if we perceive the matter in question. Hence I assigned the act
of judging itself, which consists simply in assenting (i.e., in
affirmation or denial) to the determination of the will rather than to
the perception of the intellect. (AT VIIIa:363; CSM I:307)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In marked contrast to Holcot, Descartes appeals to our introspective
experience of belief formation in <em>support</em> of an expansive
amount of doxastic control in the <em>Principles</em>, maintaining
that we can exert voluntary control over <em>every</em> would-be
belief that is not completely certain (&ldquo;Part 1&rdquo; of
<em>Principles of Philosophy</em> AT VIIIa:6; CSM I:194). And yet,
there is also a sense in which assenting to things that <em>are</em>
certain&mdash;clear and distinct perceptions&mdash;is also free
(&ldquo;Fourth Meditiation&rdquo; of <em>Meditations</em> AT
VII:57&ndash;8; CSM II:40; see below). Consequently, everything we
believe, we believe voluntarily.</p>

<p>
In his objections to the <em>Meditations</em>, Thomas Hobbes
(1588&ndash;1679) would express his discontent with Descartes&rsquo;
voluntarism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[I]t is not only knowing something to be true that is independent of
the will, but also believing it or giving assent to it. If something
is proved by valid arguments, or is reported as credible, we believe
it whether we want to or not. (&ldquo;Third Set of Objections&rdquo;
with <em>Meditations</em> AT VII:192; CSM II:134&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Though scholars have been reluctant to take Descartes&rsquo;
apparently extreme voluntarism at face value (Cottingham 2008; Newman
2015; Vitz 2010; Sch&uuml;ssler 2013; Davies 2001), it appears far
less extreme when viewed against the backdrop of the conception of
free will that Descartes seems to have favored&mdash;i.e.,
compatibilism. This latter commitment implies that, even if all assent
is voluntary, Descartes has a ready explanation for why one cannot
believe whatever one wishes&mdash;which is a primary consequence
Descartes scholars wish to avoid (Boespflug 2023). Our assent may be
determined by clarity and distinctness, but this does not exclude its
being voluntary in virtue of doxastic determination being compatible
with doxastic freedom.</p>

<p>
Mary Astell (1666&ndash;1731)&mdash;an English philosopher with
Cartesian sensibilities&mdash;would likewise assign believing to the
will, and similarly maintain that we are able to suspend assent
concerning any proposition that is not clear or evident.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ignorance&hellip;can&rsquo;t be avoided but error may&hellip;we can
suspend our judgment about those things of which we have [no idea],
till clearness and evidence oblige us to pass it&hellip;[for] judgment
belongs to the will. (<em>Serious Proposal</em>
II.iii.106&ndash;7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond Descartes and Astell, doxastic voluntarism would face
considerable resistance in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Benedict Spinoza (1632&ndash;1677) would offer what appears to be a
conceptual argument against voluntarism in his <em>Ethics</em>
(IIP49). John Locke (1632&ndash;1704) would give an account of how a
variety of doxastic states&mdash;knowledge, faith, probable
assent&mdash;are not under the direct control of the will (<em>Essay
concerning Human Understanding</em> IV.xiii.2, p. 651;
IV.xvi.8&ndash;9, p. 663). The basic idea animating Locke&rsquo;s
involuntarism is that experience shows that doxastic states are caused
by the objects of perception, or the appearance of things, which
excludes the will playing any role in the process.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s involuntarism would even figure prominently in one of
his main arguments for religious toleration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he understanding and assent (whereof God hath reserved the
disposure to himself, and not so much as entrusted man with a liberty
at pleasure to believe or reject) being not to be wrought upon by
force, a magistrate would in vain assault that part of man which owes
no homage to his authority&hellip;. [But] the magistrate may expect to
find those laws obeyed which demand not any performance above the
power of the subject. (&ldquo;First Tract on Government&rdquo;, 1660
[1997: 13]; see also &ldquo;Essay on Toleration&rdquo;, 1667 [1997:
137]; &ldquo;Letter on Toleration&rdquo;, 1686 [1968:
69&ndash;71])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since even religious belief is not under our voluntary
control&mdash;and does not bear the profile of an action&mdash;we
should not threaten citizens with punishment if they do not endorse
the religious position of the state. Yet, in spite of his persistent
emphasis on the lack of direct control we have over belief, Locke
would allow that we possess indirect control over believing insofar as
we are able to control our attention, gather evidence, and decide to
reflect (<em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> IV.xiii). He
would even carve out a narrow space for some measure of direct
voluntary control in situations where the evidence is ambiguous
(<em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> IV.xx.15, p. 716;
Boespflug 2021a).</p>

<p>
Doxastic involuntarism would also play an implicit role in the thought
of David Hume (1711&ndash;1776) and a prominent role in that of Thomas
Reid (1710&ndash;1796). In discussing &ldquo;fiction and
belief&rdquo;, Hume, not unlike Aristotle, maintains that the
difference between them</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;lies not merely in any peculiar idea, which is annexed to such
a conception as commands our assent, and which is wanting to every
known fiction. For as the mind has authority over all its ideas, it
could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any fiction, and
consequently be able to believe whatever it pleases; contrary to what
we find by daily experience. We can, in our conception, join the head
of a man to the body of a horse; but it is not in our power to
believe, that such an animal has ever really existed. (<em>Enquiry
Concerning Human Understanding</em> V.ii [1993: 31])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The involuntarism that Hume claims &ldquo;daily experience&rdquo;
attests to would have uncomfortable consequences regarding his famed
skepticism. For the latter would notoriously demand that we refrain
from many commonsense judgments based on perception, inductive
reasoning, memory, testimony, etc. Yet, Hume would further acknowledge
that one is, nevertheless, often unable to maintain such skepticism
beyond the confines of one&rsquo;s study. This is because human nature
has conferred compelling force to custom and imagination, such that it
is &ldquo;instinctive&rdquo; to assent on the basis of the
aforementioned sources in spite of the skeptical considerations that
call them into question. (<em>Enquiry</em> V.ii [1993: 31])</p>

<p>
Reid would appropriate this latter thought as a basis for a
distinctive form of epistemological naturalism, enshrining natural
belief forming tendencies as epistemic norms (Boespflug 2019). The
most salient example is Reid&rsquo;s famed &ldquo;principle of
credulity&rdquo;. The principle is, in the first place, a principle in
the sense of being a general tendency of human psychology to believe
the reports of others; it is in light of this natural tendency that we
are warranted, according to Reid, in taking others at their word. The
same goes for believing in external objects on the basis of
perception:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I will never attempt to throw off this belief [in external objects];
and, although the sober part of mankind will not be very anxious to
know my reasons&hellip;they are these: First, because it is not in my
power: why, then should I make a vain attempt? It would be agreeable
to fly to the moon, and make a visit to Jupiter and Saturn; but, when
I know that Nature has bound me down by the law of gravitation to this
planet&hellip;I rest contented&hellip;. My belief is carried along by
perception, as irresistibly as my body by the earth. (<em>Inquiry</em>
VI.xx [1983: 85])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since we cannot disbelieve our perceptions&mdash;and since our
perceptual faculties were made by &ldquo;a faithful and beneficent
Monitor&rdquo;&mdash;we are warranted in believing on the basis of
them.</p>

<h3 id="ModPer">2.4 Modern Period</h3>

<p>
Immanuel Kant (1724&ndash;1804) would also reject doxastic voluntarism
(Chignell 2007: 327) in spite of his awareness of the potential threat
such a rejection poses to epistemic responsibility (Cohen 2013). While
allowing that many common expressions suggest that believing is under
the control of the will, he maintains that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The will does not have any influence immediately on holding-to-be-true
(<em lang="de">f&uuml;rwahrhalten</em>); this would be quite
absurd.&hellip; If the will had an immediate influence on our
conviction concerning what we wish, we would constantly form for
ourselves chimeras of a happy condition, and always hold them to be
true, too. But the will cannot struggle <em>against</em> convincing
proofs of truths that are contrary to its wishes and inclinations.
(<em>J&auml;sche Logic</em> Ak 9: 73&ndash;74 [1992: 577])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet, like Holcot and Locke, Kant retains room both for some measure of
responsibility and voluntary control over belief via indirect
means:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A]lthough approval does not depend immediately on men&rsquo;s choice,
it nevertheless often does depend on it <em lang="de">indirecte</em>,
<em>mediately</em> (<em lang="de">mittelbahr</em>), since it is
according to one&rsquo;s free wish that he seeks out those grounds
that could in any way bring about approval for this or that
cognition&hellip; it still requires closer direction of choice, will,
wish, or in general of our free will, toward the grounds of proof.
(<em>Blomberg logic</em> Ak 158 [1992: 124&ndash;5])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alix Cohen has argued that further indirect control over believing may
be exercised, for Kant, via our ability to adopt epistemic maxims
(2013: 41&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Voluntarism would reemerge in the nineteenth century in the thought of
S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard (1813&ndash;1855). The metaphor for which
Kierkegaard is best known (appropriated from Gotthold Lessing) that
faith is a leap suggests that faith&mdash;and the belief which it
involves&mdash;is a type of action. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s description of
the leap in the <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em> suggests
that it is both voluntary and doxastic: the agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;leap
of faith [is] the qualitative transition&hellip;from non-belief to
belief&rdquo; (1846 [1944: 15]). Later in the same work, he maintains
that &ldquo;the leap is [in] the category of decision&rdquo; (1846
[1944: 91]). In his <em>Philosophical Fragments</em>, Kierkegaard
treats belief in general as a product of the will:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
belief is not a knowledge but an act of freedom, an expression of
will&hellip;. The conclusion of belief is no conclusion (<em lang="da">slutning</em>)
but a resolution (<em lang="da">beslutning</em>).
(1844 [1985: 83&ndash;84])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The extent to which such remarks commit him to a radical form of
voluntarism is, however, a matter of dispute (Evans 1989; Pojman 1986;
Wisdo 1987; for a more recent treatment see Quanbeck forthcoming).</p>

<h2 id="ArgForInv">3. Arguments for Involuntarism</h2>

<p>
Contemporary opponents of doxastic voluntarism typically take one of
two general approaches. There are those who think that we cannot
believe at will for contingent psychological reasons, and those who
think that we cannot believe at will for conceptual reasons (normally
regarding the nature of belief). We&rsquo;ll consider each in
turn.</p>

<h3 id="PsyInv">3.1 Psychological Involuntarism</h3>

<p>
Some authors reject doxastic voluntarism on the basis of psychological
considerations. This approach appeals to the experience of our own
purported psychological inability to form beliefs at will. The
best-known defender of this view is William Alston (1988).
Alston&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to argue against the deontological
conception of justification: the idea that epistemic justification
should be understood in terms of obligations, permissions, blame, and
the like. He notes that understanding justification in this way only
makes sense if beliefs are sufficiently controllable, as plausibly,
ought implies can: if I ought to believe <em>p</em>, I can believe
<em>p</em>. He goes on to argue that beliefs are not sufficiently
voluntary to render epistemic justification deontological. He begins
his argument for involuntarism in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
My argument for this, if it can be called that, simply consists in
asking you to consider whether you have any such powers. Can you, at
this moment, start to believe that the U.S. is still a colony of Great
Britain, just by deciding to do so. If you find it too incredible that
you should be sufficiently motivated to try to believe this, suppose
that someone offers you $500,000,000 to believe it, and you are much
more interested in the money than in believing the truth. Could you do
what it takes to get that reward? (1988: 263)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He goes on to say that it seems clear to him that &ldquo;he has no
such power&rdquo; and he &ldquo;very much doubt[s] that any human
beings are endowed with the power of taking on propositional attitudes
at will&rdquo; (1988: 263). Alston continues that, for propositions
that aren&rsquo;t clearly true or false, either you conceive of
yourself as choosing to believe when you don&rsquo;t actually have a
genuine choice (1988: 266), or you aren&rsquo;t forming a belief at
all, but rather are adopting a proposition as a basis for action or
accepting it (1988: 268). Alston concludes that we have neither basic
nor non-basic control over belief (1988: 274), and also argues that we
do not have reliable long-range control over our beliefs (1988: 276).
He&rsquo;s more optimistic about the idea that we can exercise
indirect influence over belief (1988: 278&ndash;9), but doesn&rsquo;t
think this is sufficient to ground the deontological conception of
justification.</p>

<p>
Alston&rsquo;s argument has been influential, and his approach is
endorsed by a number of subsequent authors. Alvin Plantinga (1993: 24)
makes a similar point, motivating doxastic involuntarism with related
examples. Nikolaj Nottelmann (2006) notes that he finds Alston&rsquo;s
simple argument &ldquo;entirely convincing&rdquo; (2006: 560).
Nottelmann defends Alston&rsquo;s argument against various objections
to Alston that rely on analogies between belief and action (including
Steup 1988; Ginet 2001; Ryan 2003). Rik Peels (2017: ch. 2) also
defends Alston&rsquo;s argument against various challenges: arguments
that we have direct doxastic control, indirect doxastic control, and
compatibilist doxastic control. Peels concludes that doxastic
responsibility shouldn&rsquo;t be explained in terms of (direct)
doxastic control. His positive view is that we should understand
doxastic responsibility in terms of influence, or in his words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
one responsibly believes that <em>p</em> if and only if one had
control over belief-influencing factors pertaining to one&rsquo;s
belief that <em>p</em> and either one did not violate any intellectual
obligations in coming to believe that <em>p</em> or one is excused for
doing so. (2017: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another argument that belief is contingently involuntary is given by
Anthony Booth (2017). Booth argues that belief is contingently
involuntary by appealing to the nature of suspension of judgment. He
argues that if we cannot believe at will, we also cannot suspend
judgment at will. However, conceptual arguments for
belief-involuntarism do not apply to suspension-involuntarism. It
would be odd if belief is necessarily involuntary, but suspension is
merely involuntary as a matter of our contingent psychological
limitations. Booth concludes that we should embrace the same
explanation for both belief and suspension: both are contingently
involuntary.</p>

<h3 id="ConInv">3.2 Conceptual Involuntarism</h3>

<p>
The arguably more popular route to establishing doxastic involuntarism
involves conceptual considerations regarding the nature of belief.
Advocates of this approach argue that there is something about the
notion of belief itself that precludes acquisition at will&mdash;most
notably, belief&rsquo;s possessing a constitutive truth-aim or
truth-norm. In the aim of belief literature, it&rsquo;s widely held
that beliefs formed in cases of deliberation have a particular
connection to truth. In particular, beliefs, by definition, aim at the
truth; if an attitude doesn&rsquo;t aim at the truth, it&rsquo;s not a
belief (see Moran 1988; Shah 2003; Shah &amp; Velleman 2005; McHugh
&amp; Whiting 2014; Vermaire forthcoming; and the essays in Chan (ed.)
2013). This view&mdash;that belief aims at truth&mdash;forms the
backbone for many involuntarist arguments.</p>

<p>
Bernard Williams (1973: ch. 9) provides an influential and
widely-cited argument for conceptual involuntarism. Williams argues
that belief at will would require the ability to believe <em>p</em>
regardless of whether <em>p</em> is true. Furthermore, he argues that
if you have this ability, then you&rsquo;d know you had this ability.
This, in turn, leads to the problematic implication that you could
take yourself to have a belief that you also regard to be false. But
this conflicts with the truth-aim of belief: to believe <em>p</em> is
to take <em>p</em> to be true. So, he concludes, belief at will is
impossible.</p>

<p>
While many regard Williams&rsquo; claim that belief involves a
truth-aim as a key insight, his argument is widely held to be
unsuccessful&mdash;at least without modifications. Barbara Winters
(1979), for example, raises several objections to William&rsquo;s
argument. One thing she points out is that you could have the ability
to believe <em>p</em> at will, but not realize you have this ability,
and then believe at will without having a belief you take to be false
(1979: 255). Winters instead argues for a more modest thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is impossible to believe that one believes <em>p</em> and that
one&rsquo;s belief of <em>p</em> originated and is sustained in a way
that has no connection with p&rsquo;s truth. (1979: 243)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Along similar lines, Andrei Buckareff (2014) provides a conceptual
argument for involuntarism in the spirit of Williams, tweaked to avoid
various objections.</p>

<p>
Jonathan Bennett (1990) presents a counterexample to Williams&rsquo;
claim that you cannot form a belief voluntarily without knowing
you&rsquo;d done so: the Credamites. Credamites can occasionally will
themselves to immediately acquire beliefs. However, as soon as they
come to believe in this way, they immediately forget how their belief
was acquired. These beliefs are also ones for which they have some
evidence, although their evidence about the matter is inconclusive
(1990: 93). Bennett goes on to explore some reasons why, for humans,
belief is nonetheless involuntary, but is ultimately unsatisfied with
these explanations (1990: 107).</p>

<p>
Dion Scott-Kakures (1994) argues that belief at will is conceptually
impossible. Call <em>t</em> the time before I formed a belief at will,
and \(t+1\) the time after I formed the belief. He asks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Can I have a good reason for believing that I have succeeded in
willing myself, as a basic action, from the cognitive perspective I
inhabited at <em>t</em> to the cognitive perspective I inhabit at
\(t+1\)?&hellip;It is a relatively easy matter to see why the answer
is no. (1994: 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If I intend to believe <em>p</em>, but don&rsquo;t believe it, not
believing <em>p</em> isn&rsquo;t sanctioned by my current perspective,
but then it becomes a part of my new perspective. This requires a
&ldquo;cognitive blind spot&rdquo; which means that the belief
formation is unguided or unmonitored&mdash;a necessary condition for
basic actions, according to Scott-Kakures (1994: 89)&mdash;so the
belief formation cannot be a basic action (1994: 94&ndash;95). Dana
Radcliffe (1997) responds to Scott-Kakures, arguing that you
don&rsquo;t have to regard the intended belief as unjustified, even if
it&rsquo;s not a part of your current perspective on the world.</p>

<p>
Pamela Hieronymi (2006) begins her argument against the voluntariness
of belief by defining &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and
&ldquo;belief&rdquo;. Following Bennett (1990), she maintains that an
activity is <em>voluntary</em> if it can be done immediately in
response to practical reasons (2006: 58). <em>Belief</em> is a
commitment-constituted attitude that aims at the truth: to believe
<em>p</em> is to take <em>p</em> to be true (2006: 49). She then
distinguishes two kinds of reasons for belief: content-related reasons
(reasons to think the content is true) vs. attitude-related (or
&ldquo;extrinsic&rdquo;) reasons (reasons to have the attitude: it
would be good, useful, desirable, etc.). Content-related reasons are
<em>constitutive</em> reasons for belief (2006: 52). However, if you
were to believe at will&mdash;believe immediately for practical
reasons&mdash;this would require the ability to believe for extrinsic
reasons. But this requires answering a question&mdash;whether
<em>p</em>&mdash;for reasons you don&rsquo;t take to bear on that
question (extrinsic reasons only bear on the question of whether the
belief would be good to have). So voluntary belief is impossible.
Kieran Setiya (2008) responds, arguing that Hieronymi&rsquo;s argument
proves too much: it entails that you could not voluntarily intend to
form a belief. Hieronymi (2009) agrees with Setiya that, on her view,
you cannot voluntarily intend to form a belief, but she thinks this is
actually the right result. (For a response to both Setiya and
Hieronymi, see Vermaire 2022.)</p>

<p>
In a series of papers, Conor McHugh provides a conceptual argument
that beliefs are not voluntary in the way that actions are voluntary.
He nonetheless holds that deontic appraisals of belief are appropriate
(2012b); we exercise a version of doxastic freedom modeled on freedom
of intention (2012a, 2014, 2017). Unlike many voluntarists, he also
argues that non-evidential considerations can be motivating reasons
for belief, in cases where the evidence allows but doesn&rsquo;t
compel belief (2012c, 2015).</p>

<p>
One thing to note about the arguments in this section (and the next)
is that individual authors are operating with different understandings
of &ldquo;voluntary belief&rdquo;. Some regard voluntary belief to be
equivalent to having direct control over belief (e.g., Audi 2001;
Nottelmann 2007), or, stronger, the ability to exercise direct control
for practical reasons (e.g., Buckareff 2014; Hieronymi 2006; Setiya
2008). Others understand voluntary control over belief to be the kind
of control we have over action (e.g., McHugh 2014). Still others hold
that voluntary belief doesn&rsquo;t require &ldquo;decisional
control&rdquo; but merely the appreciation of epistemic reasons (e.g.,
Shah 2002). These differences create space for hybrid views, on which
belief is voluntary in some senses but not others (e.g., perhaps
McHugh&rsquo;s view).</p>

<p>
This raises the question: what is required to establish that belief is
(in)voluntary, full stop? An argument that relies on a specific notion
of voluntary, e.g., that we cannot form beliefs directly for practical
reasons, even if sound, wouldn&rsquo;t establish that we lack direct
doxastic control more generally or that all beliefs are involuntary.
Thus, insofar as these arguments rely on a specific notion of
&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, even if they are sound, it doesn&rsquo;t
follow that beliefs are involuntary full-stop. Of course, it would be
ideal if the authors in this literature simply agreed on a single
notion of voluntary. But for now, the reader should be mindful of the
possibility that belief may be voluntary in some senses but not
others.</p>

<h2 id="DefVol">4. Defenses of Voluntarism</h2>

<p>
Contemporary doxastic voluntarists can be divided into several camps:
permissivists, compatibilists, skeptics, one-off voluntarists
(although, as we&rsquo;ll see, it&rsquo;s debatable whether these
should be called voluntarists), and authors who argue for voluntarism
based on non-traditional views of belief. We discuss each in turn.</p>

<h3 id="EpiPer">4.1 Epistemic Permissivism</h3>

<p>
Some of the cases used to motivate involuntarism involve propositions
that are obviously true (e.g., \(1+1=2\)) or obviously false (e.g.,
the US is still a colony of Great Britain); plausibly, we cannot
voluntarily disbelieve the former or believe the latter. However, not
all propositions are obviously true or false; sometimes, the evidence
is ambiguous and more difficult to assess. Epistemic permissivism is
the view that the evidence may underdetermine what is rational to
believe, such that there can be multiple rational doxastic attitudes
to a proposition, given some evidence (see Kopec &amp; Titelbaum 2016;
Jackson &amp; LaFore 2024). Permissivist voluntarists argue that we
are, at times, in situations wherein the evidence is ambivalent such
that there are genuine live, alternate options for believing. For
example, while you cannot believe \(1+1=3\) at will, perhaps if
you&rsquo;re torn about whether Smith is guilty or not, and both
Smith&rsquo;s guilt and Smith&rsquo;s innocence are reasonable
explanations of your evidence, you have a genuine choice about what to
believe.</p>

<p>
Cases of evidential underdetermination and/or ambiguity feature in
many voluntarist arguments, even if the authors don&rsquo;t explicitly
use the phrase &ldquo;epistemic permissivism&rdquo;. Carl Ginet (2001)
discusses a juror who decides to believe a defendant is guilty, a
poker player who decides to believe her opponent is bluffing, and a
person 50 miles into their road trip who decides to believe they
locked the front door (2001: 64). In each case, the thinker&rsquo;s
evidence is ambiguous with respect to the target proposition&mdash;in
Ginet&rsquo;s words, the evidence is &ldquo;noncompelling&rdquo;
(2001: 71). Philip Nickel (2010) similarly argues that voluntary
belief is possible in cases where one has &ldquo;adequate but not
conclusive evidence for a proposition&rdquo; (2010: 312). (McHugh
2015: 1122 calls these cases of &ldquo;discretion&rdquo;; see also
Frankish 2007: 541; Raz 1999: 9).</p>

<p>
Blake Roeber argues both that permissivism is true (2020), and that
permissivism clears space for doxastic voluntarism (2019). He notes
that evidence can come in small quantities. Consequently, our evidence
for a proposition sometimes <em>slowly</em> gets better or
<em>slowly</em> gets worse. Suppose you are walking toward a sign.
When you&rsquo;re far away, the sign is a complete blur; you should
withhold belief about what it says. Standing two feet away from the
sign, you should believe it says &ldquo;Exit 15&rdquo;. But as
you&rsquo;re walking towards it, Roeber&rsquo;s idea is that,
somewhere in the middle, your evidence equally supports belief and
withholding, such that you could be rational in taking either attitude
(2020). Roeber calls these &ldquo;equipollent&rdquo; cases.
Furthermore, Roeber (2019) argues that equipollent cases enable the
possibility of belief at will: when your evidence is balanced, you can
choose either to believe that <em>p</em> or to withhold on
<em>p</em>.</p>

<p>
Kurt Sylvan (2016) argues against permissivist voluntarism by arguing
that (the relevant kind of) permissivist situations aren&rsquo;t
possible. Roeber (2019: 854) responds to Sylvan that, even if this is
true, this would only show that beliefs formed voluntarily are
<em>irrational</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t follow that voluntary belief
is <em>impossible</em>. This exchange is instructive because it
clarifies what&rsquo;s required for permissivist voluntarism: not that
epistemic rationality is <em>in fact</em> permissive, but rather that
thinkers <em>believe</em> their situation is permissive or
evidentially ambiguous. If a thinker takes themselves to be in a
permissive case (even wrongly), this belief may suffice to secure the
doxastic options required for doxastic voluntarism&mdash;two or more
attitudes are &ldquo;live possibilities&rdquo; for them. So exercising
doxastic control may not require permissivism, but rather the belief
that the situation is permissive. On the other hand, if permissivism
is true but it&rsquo;s impossible to know when one is in a permissive
situation (as Smith 2020 argues), then it&rsquo;s unclear that
permissivism would enable doxastic voluntarism. Overall, then,
perceived or acknowledged permissivism is what&rsquo;s key for
believing at will. (See Coffman 2022 and Kieval 2022 for responses to
Roeber. For more on irrational doxastic voluntarism, see Kampa
2020).</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a second worry for permissivist voluntarism. Going back
to Alston, many care about doxastic voluntarism in order to secure
epistemic deontology and/or epistemic responsibility. However,
plausibly, (perceived) permissive cases are limited (how often is our
evidence perfectly balanced, equally supporting belief and
suspension?). Nonetheless, it seems like we are responsible for a
large set of our beliefs, including our beliefs in impermissive cases.
If so, it&rsquo;s unclear that permissivist voluntarism can adequately
ground epistemic responsibility. In response, the permissivist could
broaden the range of permissive cases (see Nelson 2010), or narrow the
scope of epistemic responsibility (as does Weatherson 2008).</p>

<h3 id="DoxCom">4.2 Doxastic Compatibilism</h3>

<p>
Compatibilism is the thesis that free will is compatible with
determinism. Compatibilists argue that actions can be free, even if
determined, if they satisfy other conditions, such as the absence of
impediments or a proper responsiveness to reasons. Similarly, doxastic
compatibilists argue that beliefs, even if determined, can satisfy
these same conditions for free action; thus, there is no principled
reason for regarding actions as free and beliefs not.</p>

<p>
Matthias Steup (2000; 2008; 2012; 2017), a leading proponent of
doxastic compatibilism, argues that compatibilism entails that (most
of) our actions and our beliefs are free; for similar reasons, he also
thinks we can believe intentionally. More specifically, most of our
doxastic attitudes fulfill the most popular compatibilist requirements
for free action: e.g., they fit with reactive attitudes, fit with our
higher-order attitudes, are weakly intentional, and are caused by a
reasons-responsive process (2008: 390). Holding that
&ldquo;responsiveness to practical reasons grounds freedom, [while]
responsiveness to epistemic reasons does not&rdquo;, is a form of
arbitrary preferential treatment that he labels
&ldquo;chauvinism&rdquo; (2008: 388). Thus, our beliefs can be free
and voluntary in the relevant sense, even if we couldn&rsquo;t have
believed otherwise. While Steup discusses a number of examples of
doxastic freedom, a central, recurring example he uses is
deliberation, in which we weigh the evidence for and against a
proposition, and come to a verdict about it; for example, in a court
case, you might weigh evidence to come to a verdict about whether the
defendant is guilty (2000: 35). Such cases of deliberation amount to
legitimate doxastic decisions; beliefs formed in this way are just as
free as actions are. In cases where we don&rsquo;t deliberate, belief
can still be implicitly intentional, similar to intentional, automatic
actions such as brushing one&rsquo;s teeth (2012: 155). Steup
generally doesn&rsquo;t argue for compatibilism, but makes his
arguments conditional on its truth (2000: 55; 2008: 391).</p>

<p>
Sharon Ryan (2003) is another proponent of doxastic compatibilism. She
considers the classic cases provided by Alston and Plantinga: even if
you give me a large sum of money, I cannot believe something that is
obviously false (\(1+1=3\), the sky is green). She then argues, via an
analogy with action, that these cases do not show that my beliefs are
not under my control or involuntary, as there are plenty of things one
cannot &ldquo;just do&rdquo; (2003: 63):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose I am driving down the road and I see a mother and her child
walking down the road. I see them and ask myself, &ldquo;should I run
them over?&rdquo; I immediately and freely decide not to and then
freely drive on. (2003: 63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While she is free to run over the mother and child, she cannot do it,
even if you gave her one million dollars. Similarly, even if I cannot
believe that the sky is green, that doesn&rsquo;t show that my
disbelieving it isn&rsquo;t free.</p>

<p>
Other authors (McHugh 2014, 2017; Shah 2002; Kearl 2023) might not be
accurately characterized as doxastic compatibilists, but maintain that
reasons-responsiveness can ground epistemic deontology. While McHugh
maintains that beliefs are not voluntary in the way that actions are,
he nonetheless argues that beliefs are free in the way intentions are
free: revisable in response to reasons. Shah argues that we have a
kind of agency over our beliefs, and this doesn&rsquo;t require
<em>intentional</em> believing, but that beliefs are
reasons-responsive in a Kantian way. While, unlike doxastic
compatibilists, these authors maintain that there&rsquo;s a key sense
in which all beliefs are involuntary, they also hold that this weaker
strand of doxastic freedom has all the resources for a corresponding
and robust epistemic deontology.</p>

<p>
A number of objections have been raised to doxastic compatibilism. Rik
Peels (2017) argues that compatibilist control is not sufficient for
doxastic responsibility, as you could have compatibilist control in
the sense that your beliefs are reasons-responsive, but if you cannot
influence what you believe (gather evidence, pursue intellectual
virtues, etc.), we wouldn&rsquo;t hold you responsible for your
beliefs. This suggests that (indirect) doxastic influence, rather than
any compatibilist condition, is the key to doxastic responsibility
(2017: 693&ndash;4). Timothy Perrine (2020) argues that doxastic
compatibilism is inconsistent with strong internalist versions of
epistemic deontology. Other objections to doxastic compatibilism are
raised by Buckareff (2006), Nottelmann (2006), Booth (2009), Schmitt
(2015), and Wagner (2017).</p>

<h3 id="VolSke">4.3 Voluntarism and Skepticism</h3>

<p>
A third argument for doxastic voluntarism goes back to Descartes, and
perhaps even to Epictetus and the Stoics (see Vitz 2010 for the
Cartesian roots of this picture). On this strand of voluntarism, which
is defended more recently by Brian Weatherson (2008) and Danny
Frederick (2013), our ability to shed a belief via doubt or
skepticism&mdash;and conversely, our ability to recover a belief
through relinquishing such doubts&mdash;renders both belief and
suspension under our voluntary control. Proponents of this view
generally maintain that large swaths of our beliefs are voluntary: for
Weatherson, this includes most of our inferential beliefs; for
Frederick, we have voluntary control over any belief that we are aware
of.</p>

<p>
Weatherson provides two notable examples that illustrate both how
considering and relinquishing possibilities enables voluntary doxastic
control. Suppose Mark is writing his grocery list and sees a carton of
orange juice in the fridge, and forms the belief that there&rsquo;s
orange juice in the fridge. As it turns out, his roommate has put an
empty jug back into the fridge, so his belief is false. When Mark
realizes this, he scolds himself because he lives in a student house
where things like this happen frequently; he should have considered
the possibility that the carton was empty before forming the belief
(Weatherson 2008: 552). Later that evening, Mark is watching his
favorite soccer team, Geelong; they are down by 8 goals with 15
minutes to go. His roommates ask him to come to the movies. Mark
initially declines in case Geelong comes back, but his roommate pokes
fun at Mark because of how unrealistic that is. Mark realizes his
roommate is right and forms the belief that Geelong will lose (2008:
553). Weatherson maintains that in both cases, Mark&rsquo;s beliefs
are voluntary. The former example suggests that there are things we
believe hastily, but we could have instead stopped to consider
alternative possibilities by which we&rsquo;d withhold belief instead.
And similarly, the latter case suggests that we sometimes take a
possibility seriously&mdash;perhaps too seriously&mdash;and once we
see that the possibility is unrealistic, we form a belief instead of
withholding. Weatherson thinks these changes are a common, everyday
occurrence, and renders most of our inferential beliefs voluntary
(2008: 561). Parties to the debate may object that these are exercises
of <em>indirect</em> control over belief; however, Weatherson
maintains examples like these are intuitively voluntary (and makes
less of the direct/indirect distinction than others do).</p>

<p>
Frederick (2013) takes exercise doxastic control through doubt
further, arguing that you have voluntary control over any belief that
you are aware of. Take a proposition you have a natural tendency to
believe. He argues that, normally, you can gratuitously doubt this
belief and thereby withhold belief on it; similarly, you can dismiss
the doubt and thereby believe it again. He thinks this process applies
to all beliefs we are aware of because &ldquo;there is no such thing
as decisive evidence&rdquo;; so this process can be applied in
voluntarily withholding belief, even for the beliefs that we have
excellent evidence (2013: 31&ndash;32).</p>

<h3 id="OneOffVol">4.4 One-off Voluntarism</h3>

<p>
Recall that doxastic voluntarism is an existential claim: the view
that at least <em>some</em> beliefs are voluntary. This raises the
<em>scope question</em>: which beliefs can we actually control
voluntarily? Different voluntarists would answer this question
differently, making space for a variety of views on how many beliefs
are controllable. The views we&rsquo;ve discussed in this section so
far maintain that a more substantial subset of our beliefs are
controllable. <em>One-off voluntarists</em>, by contrast, maintain
that humans may exercise voluntary doxastic control, but only in
uncommon and special cases. While technically these authors endorse
doxastic voluntarism in the aforementioned existential sense, because
their cases are so rare, it might be somewhat misleading to label them
full-blown voluntarists.</p>

<p>
Richard Feldman provides a simple case of one-off voluntarism: you can
control your belief that the lights in your office are off by going to
your office and turning the lights off (2001: 81&ndash;82). While this
isn&rsquo;t direct control, this is nonetheless immediate control, and
similar to the control we regularly exercise over our voluntary
actions. Nonetheless, these cases are limited in scope: we&rsquo;ll
only be able to change our beliefs about states of the world that we
have a legitimate and relatively direct control over. Furthermore,
Feldman seems to think that Alston&rsquo;s classic argument applies to
most of our beliefs, with this rare exception. So, while we&rsquo;d be
hesitant to label Feldman a voluntarist, we think this type of
doxastic control is noteworthy.</p>

<p>
A second strand of one-off voluntarism, defended by Rik Peels (2015)
and Andrew Reisner (2013), involves <em>evidence-dependent
beliefs</em>: beliefs that, when formed, change the believer&rsquo;s
evidence that they are true. Peels (2015: 529) discusses a case
involving Dr. Transparent, a scientist who has developed a
mind-reading technique that perfectly reliably reads off
people&rsquo;s states of mind. Dr. Transparent promises that he will
give you $10, if you come to believe, within a minute, that you will
receive $10. (If you disbelieve you&rsquo;ll get $10, he won&rsquo;t
give you $10.) Peels&rsquo; case is one in which the truth depends on
the belief: if you believe that <em>p</em>, then <em>p</em> is true;
if you believe that not-<em>p</em>, then not-<em>p</em> is true. Peels
argues that this style of case meets seven conditions, commonly taken
to be closely tied to believing at will: knowing you have the ability,
exercising the ability in this particular case, the belief formed at
will is rational, the belief is the result of a direct or basic
action, the belief is formed at will (at least partially) for
practical reasons, the belief is formed intentionally, and the
question of whether to believe <em>p</em> is settled by whether
it&rsquo;s worthwhile to believe <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>
Reisner (2013)&rsquo;s case involves Alice, who participates in a
psychology experiment involving a perfectly reliable mind reading
machine and display. At some point, a number will pop up on the
display, based on a function of what Alice believes the number will
be. Reisner considers a &ldquo;multiple fixed points&rdquo; case in
which if Alice&rsquo;s predicted number, \(n\), is greater than or
equal to 0, the number displayed is \(n/2+1\); if \(n\) is less than
0, the displayed number is \(n/2-1\) (2013: 169). In this case, if
Alice believes the number will be \(2\), it will be \(2\), and if
Alice believes the number will be \(-2\), it will be \(-2\). (If Alice
believes it will be another number, Alice&rsquo;s belief will be
unstable.) \(2\) and \(-2\) are &ldquo;fixed points&rdquo;: if Alice
forms either belief, Alice&rsquo;s belief is known. Reisner calls this
a &ldquo;leap of knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;Alice could change her belief
from \(2\) to \(-2\), &ldquo;leaping&rdquo; back and forth, but either
way, her belief would amount to knowledge. Reisner, while admitting
that his argument doesn&rsquo;t support any kind of unrestricted
doxastic voluntarism, concludes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
this very limited kind of doxastic voluntarism is consistent with the
view that the aim of belief is truth (or knowledge) and that the aim
of belief plays a role in setting the norms of belief. (2013: 178)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Plausibly, Peels&rsquo; and Reisner&rsquo;s cases are permissive ones
[see Kopec 2015], so this is yet another voluntarist argument with
permissivism in the background. For a response to Peels and Reisner,
see Antill 2020.)</p>

<h3 id="VolNonStaVieBel">4.5 Voluntarism and Non-Standard Views of Belief</h3>

<p>
A final motivation for voluntarism involves authors who adopt or argue
for non-standard views of belief. For example, Matthew Boyle (2009)
argues that believing is an activity. Sara Aronowitz (2023;
forthcoming) adopts a similar view on which believing is analogous to
planning; she argues that such a view makes sense of data from
cognitive psychology on which stored beliefs are dynamic and
reconstructive. Brian Hedden (2009) and Aaron Zimmerman (2018) both
argue for pragmatist views of belief (i.e., the primary function of
belief is to guide and/or rationalize action) on which beliefs and
actions are equally voluntary. Hedden specifically discusses how such
a view could vindicate the deontological conception of
justification.</p>

<p>
While this motivation for voluntarism is noteworthy, many
involuntarists will likely reply that this doesn&rsquo;t threaten
their position, since the notion of belief invoked by these
voluntarists is revisionary. While the concept of belief as an action
(or action-like) might very well render belief voluntary, most in the
literature are working with another notion of belief. At the very
least, this move shifts the discussion from the question &ldquo;is
belief voluntary?&rdquo; to the question &ldquo;what is
belief?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="EmpWorVol">5. Empirical Work on Voluntarism</h2>

<p>
As we have seen, the psychological approach to arguing for doxastic
involuntarism relies on the judgment that direct attempts to form
beliefs at will always remain ineffective. An introspective
examination of the process of belief formation, involuntarists
maintain, reveals that we have no more direct control over believing a
proposition than we do over secreting gastric juices (Alston 1988:
263). This method of determining what is and is not psychologically
possible, however, lacks a systematic rigor that would contribute much
greater evidential support to involuntarist claims, or for that
matter, to voluntarist claims. These considerations have led some
contributors to the debate to employ the tools of the psychological
sciences in reformulating the psychological case for or against
voluntarism.</p>

<p>
Among the first such studies, carried out by Turri, Rose, and
Buckwalter, purportedly found considerable evidence supporting the
truth of voluntarism. Their findings are based on non-philosophers
predominately agreeing (on a Likert scale) that individuals, described
in a series of vignettes, are able to make choices in believing. They
argue that their results concerning &ldquo;folk psychology&rdquo;
support the idea that belief is voluntary, and that those same results
even <em>refute</em> the conceptual claim that the notion of belief
itself secures its involuntariness (2018: 2509; see also Cusimano
&amp; Goodwin 2019). Nottelmann, Booth, and Lomholt respond by arguing
that Turri et al. problematically make the dubious assumption that the
subjects of their studies have <em>direct</em> control in mind when
they maintain that a belief may be chosen (2023: 7). Nottelmann et al.
(2023) conducted a set of studies showing that participants tend to
refer to a belief as chosen, even when it is acquired through
obviously <em>indirect</em> means. Thus, finding that laypeople hold
that beliefs may be chosen &ldquo;just like that&rdquo; does not on
its own support the traditional voluntarist claim that belief is under
the <em>direct</em> control of the will. Indeed, Nottelmann et al. go
so far as to claim that the general insensitivity of laypeople to such
distinctions of fundamental significance to the voluntarist debate
substantially limits the degree to which studies of laypeople can
provide any compelling evidence for or against voluntarism.</p>

<p>
Further studies by Cusimano and Goodwin suggest that laypeople
attribute a greater ability to others in voluntarily changing beliefs
than they do to themselves (2020; Cusimano, Zorrilla, Danks, &amp;
Lombrozo 2024 found something similar). This plausibly suggests that
laypeople hold that there are significant constraints on voluntary
belief change when it comes to their own beliefs&mdash;a finding in
keeping with the introspective reports of epistemologists. Indeed,
such findings may furnish an important methodological benchmark for
further studies: since laypeople are more aware of their own evidence
and processes of reasoning, their ability to judge the measure of
doxastic control of others may be substantially limited. While
empirical inquiry concerning doxastic voluntarism is controversial, it
is unclear why it would not amount to a legitimate&mdash;perhaps a
necessary&mdash;extension of the psychological approach to the issue,
provided experiments are adequately sensitive to distinctions
concerning varieties of control.</p>

<h2 id="EthBel">6. The Ethics of Belief</h2>

<p>
It has become conventional to understand the ethics of belief to
broadly pertain to questions concerning the nature of the norms that
govern belief formation (see also entry on
 <a href="../ethics-belief/">the ethics of belief</a>).
 Yet, the ethics of belief may also be understood more strictly to
pertain to the moral or prudential obligations we bear to the process
of belief formation. The phrase derives from W.K. Clifford&rsquo;s
classic essay, &ldquo;The Ethics of Belief&rdquo; (published in 1877),
even though the idea that we have moral duties pertaining to our
beliefs is much older. Clifford would notoriously claim that it is
always wrong to believe on insufficient evidence, where
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; appears to have a distinctively <em>moral</em>
valence.</p>

<p>
In his famous reply to Clifford, &ldquo;The Will to Believe&rdquo;,
William James would reject Clifford&rsquo;s evidentialism on the
practical grounds that evidentially undersupported beliefs are
sometimes risks worth taking (1896; see also Pace 2011). This
pragmatist rejection of evidentialism raises questions at the heart of
the ethics of belief: must one always believe on the basis of adequate
evidence or epistemic reasons? Is it permissible to believe on the
basis of prudential or moral reasons?</p>

<p>
The issue of doxastic voluntarism is particularly germane to the
ethics of belief insofar as the extent to which we can control the
process of belief formation would seem to give shape to what duties we
might bear in believing (Audi 2001). If it turns out that we have no
direct control over believing&mdash;and we suppose that
&ldquo;cannot&rdquo; implies no &ldquo;ought&rdquo;&mdash;then our
obligations vis-&agrave;-vis our beliefs cannot consist in choosing
certain beliefs. Instead, our obligations (if such there be) consist
in exerting our will upon some other stage of the process of belief
formation.</p>

<h3 id="EpiDeo">6.1 Epistemic Deontologism</h3>

<p>
One purportedly common way of understanding epistemic obligations is
that they are duties that bear on belief formation itself (Alston
1988; Plantinga 1993: chapter 1). This view is known as <em>epistemic
deontologism</em>. Epistemic norms, on this view, are normative in the
<em>prescriptive</em> sense. While there may be additional obligations
that bear on other stages of the process of acquiring
beliefs&mdash;e.g., in gathering evidence&mdash;those pertaining to
belief formation itself are most fundamental. It is in the context of
arguing that an endorsement of doxastic voluntarism is indispensable
to epistemic deontology that Alston made his seminal case against
voluntarism.</p>

<p>
Though this deontological conception of epistemic obligations need not
entail that epistemic duties are also <em>moral</em> duties, there is
a tradition of thinking about them in this way. This is how Descartes,
for instance, is commonly understood to conceive of epistemic
obligations (e.g., Plantinga 1993: 19&ndash;22), owing to his
suggestive description of doxastic mistakes as a kind of
&ldquo;sin&rdquo; (<em lang="la">peccatum</em>) we are &ldquo;at
fault&rdquo; for (&ldquo;Fourth Meditiation&rdquo; of
<em>Meditations</em> AT VII:58; CSM II:41). Believing on the basis of
clarity and distinctness, in contrast, is &ldquo;behaving
correctly&rdquo; (<em lang="la">recte agere</em>) (AT VII:59; CSM
II:41). Though careful examination reveals Descartes to be ambiguous
on this matter (&ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo; of <em>Meditations</em> AT
VII:15; CSM II:11), one can see how the view would naturally
complement his thoroughgoing voluntarism (see
 <a href="#EarModPer">section 2.3</a>
 of this entry). Clifford is less ambiguous about a moral valence of
epistemic obligations, and casts the obligation to believe in accord
with the evidence as both moral and, apparently, as applying to belief
formation itself (1877 [2004: 517]). Other defenders of epistemic
deontologism do not maintain that the epistemic ought has any moral
bearing (Feldman 1988; 2000), and they differ on whether deontologism
requires voluntary control (Steup 2000 holds that it does; Feldman
2000 holds that it does not).</p>

<p>
One recent and controversial extension of the idea that we have moral
duties to believe is the claim that believing in certain ways can
wrong others. This view, known as <em>doxastic wronging</em>, implies
that believing itself is <em>morally</em> impermissible in some
instances. The standard examples are those of purportedly racist
beliefs (Basu 2018; cf. Gardiner 2018; Fritz &amp; Jackson 2021; Enoch
&amp; Spectre forthcoming). Some defenders of this view maintain that
its plausibility hangs on the truth or falsity of doxastic
voluntarism, and point to defenses of voluntarism as evidence that
doxastic agents possess adequate doxastic control to ground claims of
moral agency in believing (Basu &amp; Schoeder 2018).</p>

<h3 id="Pra">6.2 Pragmatism</h3>

<p>
The idea that beliefs can wrong others&mdash;as well as James&rsquo;
position that we may believe evidentially undersupported propositions
for practical reasons&mdash;raises the broader issue of whether it is
even possible for there to be practical reasons for (or against)
believing. Several authors argue that there are. Susanna Rinard
maintains that the rationality of beliefs &ldquo;is determined in
precisely the same way as the rationality of other states&rdquo;
(2017: 123), notably including actions. Hence, &ldquo;moral or
prudential considerations can be reasons for belief&rdquo; (2019: s.4;
see also Leary 2017). Barry Maguire and Jack Woods endorse a closely
related, albeit stronger, position: namely, that &ldquo;there are
practical reasons for beliefs, and, indeed, that all authoritative
reasons for belief are practical reasons&rdquo; (2020: 244). These
authors, however, acknowledge that such pragmatic conceptions of
doxastic rationality depend upon a substantial measure of control over
belief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he significance of our line on this sort of case is vulnerable to
future work on &ldquo;ought implies can&rdquo; and doxastic
voluntarism. (Maguire &amp; Woods 2020: 244; see also Rinard 2019:
s.4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After all, if it turns out that doxastic agents cannot, as a matter of
psychological fact, believe on the basis of practical reasons, then
the plausibility of such theories of rationality is potentially called
into question.</p>

<h3 id="EviGat">6.3 Evidence Gathering</h3>

<p>
Though some doxastic involuntarists reject epistemic deontologism,
they may nevertheless maintain that we still bear certain obligations
pertinent to the process of belief formation. Their involuntarism
simply precludes those obligations bearing directly on belief
formation itself. Perhaps the most prominent among these is the
purported obligation to <em>gather evidence</em> in a responsible way
(Locke 1689: IV.xv.5; Feldman 2000; Flores &amp; Woodard 2023). For
example, when considering whether anthropogenic climate change is
afoot, I may choose to consult a report by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change or one by the Heritage Foundation&mdash;or I might
prefer a snug place on the couch and gather no evidence whatsoever.
Even if I cannot decide what to believe about climate change on the
basis of what I learn in the report (or do not learn), it is plausible
that I am nevertheless obligated to consult at least some
evidence.</p>

<p>
It is a matter of some dispute how far this obligation extends. Are we
obligated to fastidiously gather evidence with regard to any
proposition we entertain? This is clearly not feasible. It is more
plausible that there are a limited range of practically weighty
propositions for which we have such an obligation. And one might think
of the obligation to gather evidence as bearing a positive and linear
relationship to the practical importance of the proposition in
question.</p>

<h3 id="Ref">6.4 Reflection</h3>

<p>
Though gathering evidence has been regarded by some as the only
obligation we bear to the process of belief formation, it seems that
this cannot be enough. For merely gathering evidence is not sufficient
for making a satisfactory judgment regarding a proposition that one is
entertaining. After all, one may have evidence which
<em>propositionally</em> justifies a potential belief, yet one may not
have done the requisite cognitive work for <em>doxastic</em>
justification&mdash;i.e., for adequately anchoring the belief in the
relevant evidence. For example, one might learn that sea-level rise is
predicted to be .6 meters by 2100; and one might also have learned
years ago that many portions of the low-lying island nation, Tuvalu,
are below .6 meters. Yet, given the temporal gap, one may fail to see
the implication that many portions of Tuvalu will be largely submerged
by high tides by 2100. That is, some measure of <em>reflection</em> is
often required to see the implications of our evidence&mdash;a task
which we can clearly carry out even if voluntarism is false. It is
plausible that we are obligated to carry out such reflection in
certain circumstances (see Tidman 1996; Stapleford 2013).</p>

<h3 id="AdoEpiNor">6.5 Adopting Epistemic Norms</h3>

<p>
As noted above regarding Kant
 (<a href="#ModPer">section 2.4</a>),
 some have claimed that our adoption of epistemic norms, or doxastic
policies, is one way of exerting doxastic control (Cohen 2010; see
also Helm 1994). Even if one cannot directly decide to believe in
accord with the evidence, one may perhaps decide to endorse, for
example, evidentialism. What&rsquo;s more, one may plausibly maintain,
as Clifford did, that there is a moral obligation to adhere to it.
Explicitly adhering to such a principle will surely exert a powerful
influence upon a wide range of propositions one entertains for
belief.</p>

<p>
A puzzle arises, however, when one asks whether in such a situation
one <em>believes</em> evidentialism is true. If so, how can one
voluntarily adopt it without being antecedently committed to a kind of
direct voluntary control (Peels 2013)? If one were to insist that an
endorsement of evidentialism&mdash;or any other epistemic
principle&mdash;is the automatic output of the principle&rsquo;s being
self-evident or highly plausible, then it becomes unclear that one has
voluntary control over believing evidentialism. If, on the other hand,
it is claimed that one does <em>not</em> believe the epistemic
principle in question, it becomes difficult to see the sense in which
one adheres to it (however, see Goldberg 2013 and Fleisher 2018 for
alternative non-doxastic attitudes one may take toward their preferred
philosophical views).</p>

<h3 id="EpiVirVic">6.6 Epistemic Virtue and Vice</h3>

<p>
Even if it is not clear whether we have control over adopting doxastic
policies, we do seem to have control over cultivating character traits
that shape the process of belief formation (see also
 <a href="#VarCon">&sect;1.1</a>).
 While one cannot decide to become intellectually humble &ldquo;just
like that&rdquo;, one can decide to reconsider a position one
previously rejected, examine evidence against one&rsquo;s own
positions, and subject the latter to fresh critical scrutiny. Should
these practices solidify over time into habits, one would thereby
embody the virtue of intellectual humility (see entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-virtue/">virtue epistemology</a>).
 Correspondingly, should one not carry out these activities, it may be
that one is passively contributing to the cultivation of an opposing
epistemic vice&mdash;e.g., dogmatism or epistemic pride. In light of
the important role such practices play, Clifford, for example, implies
that there is a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; moral &ldquo;duty&rdquo; to
engage in virtue-cultivating practices. For in their absence one
&ldquo;may help to&hellip;keep alive the fatal superstitions which
clog [one&rsquo;s] race&rdquo; (1877 [1879: 183]).</p>

<h2 id="RelFai">7. Religious Faith</h2>

<p>
Doxastic obligations are a central part of many religious traditions
(see entry on
 <a href="../faith/">faith</a>).
 For example, in traditions such as Christianity and Islam, believing
that God exists or believing certain religious doctrines is often
necessary for, or at least a key part of, religious commitment. In
Buddhism, those who are following the Eightfold Path are encouraged to
believe (or at least accept) the Four Noble Truths (see Siderits
2007). Furthermore, on some views, faith that <em>p</em> requires
belief that <em>p</em> (see Malcolm &amp; Scott 2016). Other theistic
arguments (e.g., Pascal&rsquo;s wager) conclude that one should form
theistic beliefs. However, if doxastic involuntarism is true, then
it&rsquo;s difficult to make sense of doxastic religious obligations.
If &ldquo;ought&rdquo; implies &ldquo;can&rdquo;, and we cannot
control our religious beliefs, then it seems like there couldn&rsquo;t
be doxastic religious obligations. Thus, the truth of doxastic
voluntarism is central to questions about the rationality of religious
belief and religious commitment within many traditions.</p>

<p>
Authors working on doxastic religious obligations generally fall into
four categories (see Jackson 2021). First, some authors deny that we
have religious doxastic obligations at all, and locate these
obligations elsewhere: for example, as obligations to act on, or
accept religious claims, or as obligation to make a non-doxastic
religious commitment. On some strands of Judaism, for instance, how
one acts is much more important than what one believes; David Benatar
(2006) even suggests that it&rsquo;s perfectly sensible to be
religiously Jewish and also an atheist. Some traditions in Hinduism
similarly emphasize action. Gavin Flood, in his introduction to
Hinduism, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One striking feature of Hinduism is that practice takes precedence
over belief. What a Hindu does is more important than what a Hindu
believes. Hinduism is not credal. (Flood 1996: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the Christian and Islamic traditions, philosophers writing on faith
have argued for the possibility that one could have faith that God
exists even absent belief that God exists, in part motivated by
concerns regarding doxastic voluntarism (see, e.g., Pojman 1986;
Alston 1996; Speak 2007; Audi 2011; Aijaz 2023; Lebens 2023). If faith
doesn&rsquo;t require belief but instead, say, acceptance (acting as
if a proposition is true), commitment, or a similar action-like state,
then, even if we cannot control our religious beliefs, we can control
whether we have religious faith, which is arguably the more central
religious attitude.</p>

<p>
Other authors have made a similar move regarding Pascal&rsquo;s Wager.
Janesist Catholic Blaise Pascal, writing in the Christian tradition,
is often credited with this pragmatic argument for belief in God
(1670). However, similar pragmatic arguments exist in the Islamic
tradition (see Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1105 [1991: chapter IV]) and in
the Buddhist tradition (in the discourse to the K&#257;l&#257;mas; see
Holder 2006). While these arguments are normally framed as pragmatic
arguments for theistic <em>belief</em>, they could be framed
differently: e.g., reasons to make a religious commitment or to accept
that God exists. Then, pragmatic arguments for theism are compatible
with doxastic involuntarism and ought implies can (see Jones 1998;
Rota 2016). (This move is, arguably, advocated by Pascal himself, when
he says that even if one cannot believe immediately, one ought to act
as if one believes, by &ldquo;taking holy water, having
masses&hellip;&rdquo; (1670: fragment 233 [1958: 68]).</p>

<p>
A second possibility is to deny that ought implies can. Perhaps we
have religious doxastic obligations even if we cannot control our
religious beliefs. Richard Feldman (2000) advocates this approach to
doxastic obligations, generally. According to Feldman, doxastic
obligations are &ldquo;role oughts&rdquo;: obligations we have qua our
role as believers. We have these obligations because we are in the
relevant role, even if we lack direct doxastic control. While Feldman
isn&rsquo;t concerned with religious belief in particular, his
argument may be applied to it.</p>

<p>
Third, some authors argue that <em>indirect</em> doxastic control is
key to understanding religious doxastic obligations. Even if we cannot
directly control our beliefs, we can control our belief-forming
practices: what evidence we gather, how we gather evidence, what
sources we pay attention to, how much we reflect on our beliefs and
evidence, and the like. These practices inevitably influence our
beliefs, albeit indirectly. Lindsay Rettler (2018a) argues that we
have indirect reflective control&mdash;i.e., the kind of control we
exercise when we reflect on various reasons and evidence for our
current and potential beliefs&mdash;over both belief and faith. This
indirect control is sufficient to ground doxastic obligations and
blame.</p>

<p>
Finally, others argue that doxastic involuntarism is false, and we
have voluntary control over our religious beliefs. For example,
Elizabeth Jackson (2023) argues that most of us are in a permissive
situation with respect to our religious beliefs, and this allows for
the possibility that most of us can exercise direct control over our
religious beliefs. Jackson argues that, given this framework, we can
understand pragmatic theistic arguments as applying directly to
belief; her arguments also apply to questions about the voluntariness
of religious faith and religious belief.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
