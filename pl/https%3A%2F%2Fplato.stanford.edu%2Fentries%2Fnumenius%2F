<h1>Numenius</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon May 4, 2009; substantive revision Tue Oct 1, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Numenius, a Platonist philosopher of the mid 2<sup>nd</sup> century
CE, had considerable impact on later Platonism, most notably on
Plotinus (3<sup>rd</sup> c.) and Porphyry
(3<sup>rd</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> c). His work, surviving only in
fragments, is important both historically and philosophically. Its
historical significance lies mainly in that it shows how much of
Plotinus&rsquo; philosophy, especially Plotinus&rsquo; metaphysics,
was inspired by earlier Platonists such as Numenius, who was one of
the authors read in Plotinus&rsquo; seminar (Porphyry, <em>Life of
Plotinus</em> 14.12). Plotinus&rsquo; debt to Numenius&rsquo;
philosophy was much debated already by Platonists of Plotinus&rsquo;
generation (ibid. 18.2&ndash;3, 17.1&ndash;23). This discussion shows
that Plotinus was not considered in his own time to have initiated a
new and distinct movement in Platonism&mdash;what we today call
Neoplatonism. He was rather seen as simply continuing and developing
the philosophy of previous Platonists, Numenius being prominent among
them, just as they themselves had developed in similar fashion the
work of their own Platonist predecessors. Numenius&rsquo; significance
also lies in his impact on the thought of early Christian thinkers
like Origen and Eusebius, who were captured by Numenius&rsquo;
references to Hebrews as an ancient source of true doctrines (see
below Numenius&rsquo; Platonism) and saw in his doctrine of three gods
a prefiguration of the Christian trinitarian doctrine.</p>

<p>
Philosophically, Numenius&rsquo; work is important because he, like
Eudorus and Moderatus (1<sup>st</sup> c. CE), tried to construct a
hierarchical system of intelligible principles (<em>archai</em>) of
reality, but unlike them he held that intelligible principles are
responsible only for the order of the world, wherein its goodness
lies, while matter has an existence independent of these principles
and accounts for disorder and badness. In this sense Numenius
maintains a dualism in metaphysics that has affinities with that of
Plutarch but also with that of the Chaldean Oracles. Numenius&rsquo;
system of three principles of reality, similar to Plotinus&rsquo;
hypostases of One, Intellect and Soul, was constructed on the basis of
accounts of the intelligible world and its primacy, and of the soul as
a spiritual substance essentially related to that world, in Plato.
More specifically, it results from reflection on and interpretation of
the Form of the Good in <em>Republic</em> VI, the demiurge and the
world-soul of the <em>Timaeus</em>, and the One of the
<em>Parmenides</em>. The hierarchical order of these principles of
reality is determined by the degree of unity and simplicity of each;
the highest principle is the simplest and most completely a unity. It
is also absolutely good and transmits goodness.</p>

<p>
The reconstruction of Numenius&rsquo; philosophy that follows below
relies on direct quotations, all of which come from the Christian
writer Eusebius of Caesarea (4th c.), and on testimonies, coming from
a variety of ancient sources, such as Origen, Porphyry, Calcidius,
Macrobius, Proclus. The collection of &Eacute;. des Places used here,
in the absence of a better one, fails to distinguish between fragments
and testimonies, thus &ldquo;fr.&rdquo; in this collection and here
stands for both fragments and testimonies. Boys-Stones 2018a includes
in his collection of Middle Platonist texts all fragments and
testimonies of Numenius with English translation. Reinhardt (2023)
collects, translates and comments on the fragments of Numenius&rsquo;
<em>On the Dissension of the Academics from Plato</em>
(816&ndash;836), while Jourdan 2023, the first monograph on Numenius,
offers a collection of the fragments and testimonies of
Numenius&rsquo; work <em>On the Good</em> with French translation
(467&ndash;493).</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Work</h2>

<p>
Very little is known about Numenius&rsquo; life. The existing evidence
associates Numenius with two cities, Apamea in Syria and Rome.
Plotinus&rsquo; student, Amelius, who was an enthusiastic admirer of
Numenius (Porphyry, <em>Life of Plotinus</em> 3.44&ndash;5), calls him
&ldquo;Apamean&rdquo; (ibid. 17.18) and himself moved from Rome to
Apamea after Plotinus&rsquo; death (ibid. 2.32&ndash;33). John Lydus
(6<sup>th</sup> c. CE), however, refers to Numenius as &ldquo;the
Roman&rdquo; (<em>De mensibus</em> &Iota;V.80, p. 132.11&ndash;12
W&uuml;nsch). The strong interest that both Amelius and Porphyry take
in Numenius makes the evidence about Numenius in Porphyry&rsquo;s
<em>Life of Plotinus</em> quite significant, but the testimony of John
Lydus may also hold some truth. One possible way of reconciling the
two is that Numenius was born in Apamea but taught both there and
later also in Rome (Dodds 1960, 6&ndash;7). Such a hypothesis may
explain two facts, first, Numenius&rsquo; familiarity with different
intellectual traditions, including oriental ones, and, second, the
attraction that Rome exercised to Plotinus, who moved there from
Alexandria in 246 and founded his own school. (Jourdan 2023,
17&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Several indications point to a date around the middle of the
2<sup>nd</sup> century CE for Numenius&rsquo; philosophical activity.
There is good evidence to suggest that Numenius antedates the
Platonist Atticus, whose <em>floruit</em> is set around 176 (Eusebius,
<em>Chronicle</em>, p. 207 Helm): Proclus in his 5<sup>th</sup>-c. CE
Commentary on the <em>Timaeus</em> outlines in chronological order the
views of ancient Platonists on the relation of the demiurge (the
creator god of the <em>Timaeus</em> myth) to the Forms, presenting
first those of Numenius, then of Harpocration and Atticus, then of
Plotinus, Amelius, Porphyry and Iamblichus (<em>In Timaeum</em>
I.303.27&ndash;307.19). The chronological order is disturbed only by
the place of Harpocration (a pupil of Atticus) in the list, but this
is because the latter follows Numenius rather than Atticus in his
interpretation of the way the demiurge relates to the Forms (Proclus,
<em>In Timaeum</em> I.304.22&ndash;305.16; on this matter see below
the sections on, Metaphysics, Influence). Furthermore, a number of
indications suggest Atticus&rsquo; own dependence on Numenius.
Atticus&rsquo; work targeting those who profess to teach Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy through the use of the writings of Aristotle (Atticus frs.
1&ndash;9 Des Places) may well be inspired from Numenius&rsquo; plea
for a purification of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy from alien elements,
Aristotelian and Stoic included. Numenius argues for a similar
purification in his work <em>On the Dissension of the Academics from
Plato</em> (fr. 24&ndash;28 Des Places). The resemblance between the
relevant works of Atticus and Numenius extends to details: the analogy
of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy with the body of Pentheus torn apart by
the Bacchai, that is found in Atticus (fr. 1.19&ndash;23 Des Places)
goes back to Numenius (fr. 24.71&ndash;73), and so does the comparison
of the 3<sup>rd</sup> c. BCE Academic skeptic Arcesilaus&rsquo;
suspension of judgment (<em>epoch&ecirc;</em>) to the cuttle fish
spreading ink (Numenius fr. 25.77&ndash;81; cf. Atticus fr.
7.78&ndash;81 Des Places). Atticus, however, presents Plato as the one
who unified philosophy by putting together its dispersed parts, while
Numenius implies that Plato combined parts which were belonging to the
same body, i.e. Pythagorean philosophy. Besides, Numenius makes
Arcesilaus resemble the cuttle fish, in order to highlight the
latter&rsquo;s skeptic suspension of judgment as an escaping device,
while Atticus applies the same analogy to Aristotle whose philosophy
he criticizes as obscure. Numenius&rsquo; dating in the middle
2<sup>nd</sup> century is compatible with two further facts: the first
surviving author who mentions Numenius is Clement of Alexandria
(<em>ca.</em> 150&ndash;215) in his <em>Stromata</em> (I.22.150.4).
Clement cites Numenius asking rhetorically what is Plato but an
atticizing Moses, a citation that Eusebius takes up (<em>Praep.
Ev.</em> XI.10.14, fr. 8; on this see below, Influence). The second
fact that pertains to Numenius&rsquo; dating is that the latest author
that Numenius mentions is Mnaseas (fr. 25.17), the
&ldquo;methodist&rdquo; doctor of the 1<sup>st</sup> c. CE.
Numenius&rsquo; fragments and testimonies exhibit many resemblances
with the Chaldean Oracles, a collection of verses composed at the time
of Marcus Aurelius (161&ndash;180), but it is unclear who is dependent
on whom here, or whether we have to do with parallel developments (on
this see Jourdan 2023, 147&ndash;216).</p>

<p>
We are fortunate to know the titles of some of Numenius&rsquo;
treatises. One was <em>On the Good</em>, which comprised at least 6
books (Eusebius, <em>Praep. Ev.</em> XI.18.22). Apparently, this was
one of Numenius&rsquo; most important works and judging from the
existing excerpts, it must have been cast in dialogical form (see frs.
3, 4a Des Places; cf. Edwards 2010, 118&ndash;120, Jourdan 2023,
24&ndash;28). In it Numenius set out to outline his ontology and
theology and, more specifically, to investigate the nature of the
first principle, which is divine, the cause of everything, and also
the source of goodness (hence the title <em>On the Good</em>).
Numenius is clearly inspired by Plato&rsquo;s accounts of the Form of
the Good in <em>Republic</em> VI (508e-509b) and of the goodness of
the demiurge in the <em>Timaeus</em> (29e-30b), yet, as explained
below, he did not identify the demiurge with the Form of the Good;
rather, the demiurge is distinct from and dependent on the Form of the
Good. Also important must have been Numenius&rsquo; work <em>On the
Indestructibility of the Soul</em> (Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em>
V.57; fr. 29 Des Places), in at least two books. We know of only one
certain testimony of this work, but it is probable that many of the
testimonies of later Platonists regarding Numenius&rsquo; views on the
soul reflect claims made in it (Dillon 1977, 364; see below,
Psychology). Quite unclear, though, remains the content of
Numenius&rsquo; treatise <em>On Plato&rsquo;s Secret Doctrines</em>
(Eusebius, <em>Prep. Ev</em>. XIII.4.4; fr. 23 Des Places). In the
sole surviving fragment (fr. 23) Numenius discusses Plato&rsquo;s use
of the character Euthyphro in the <em>Euthyphro</em> as representative
of Athenian popular religion. Dillon (1977, 364) has speculated with
reason that in this work Numenius proposed allegorical interpretations
of aspects of Platonic dialogues, while more recently Jourdan (2023,
21, 69&ndash;71) has claimed that Numenius proposed an allegorical
interpretation of the main divine figures in Hesiod&rsquo;s
<em>Theogony</em>, which are presented in <em>Cratylus</em> (396a-d).
This is possible since Numenius appears to have indulged in
allegorical interpretation of the cultic practices of various nations,
taking them to be philosophically significant (fr. 1a; see below,
Numenius&rsquo; Platonism). But given Numenius&rsquo; attachment to
Pythagoreanism (on which see below, Numenius&rsquo; Platonism) it may
also be the case that in this work Numenius presented doctrines that
Platonists traditionally associated with Plato, such as the
immortality of the soul, as originally Pythagorean (see Dillon 1988,
121).</p>

<p>
Numenius&rsquo; best attested work is his treatise <em>On the
Dissension of the Academics from Plato</em> (frs. 24&ndash;28 Des
Places, also in Reinhardt 2023). Eusebius in his <em>Preparatio
Evangelica</em> (<em>Preparation for the Gospel</em>) has excerpted
five long pieces from it (in book XIV). The reason why Eusebius quotes
so extensively from this work of Numenius is in order to substantiate
his claim, which permeates the entire <em>Preparatio Evangelica</em>,
that ancient philosophers were in disagreement with each other. He
takes that feature to indicate the inability of pagan philosophy to
reach the truth (on Eusebius&#8125; reading of Numenius see des Places
1975, Jourdan 2015). This is an originally skeptic argument, that is
employed by Academic and Pyrrhonean skeptics alike, to the effect that
dogmatic philosophy amounts to failure because of the disagreements
occurring in it (Cicero, <em>Academica</em> II.115, Sextus Empiricus,
<em>Against the Mathematicians</em> II.11). Eusebius has a special
kind of disagreement in mind, namely that with Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy, which he considers to have come closer to the truth than
any other pagan philosophy, that is, in his view, to Christian
doctrine (<em>Praep. Ev.</em> XI.pref. 2&ndash;3, XI.8.1, XIII.4.3).
Numenius&rsquo; testimony in this work fits well an argument like that
of Eusebius. For Numenius criticizes in this work the departure of the
skeptical Academics from what he considers to be Plato&rsquo;s central
doctrine, namely, the doctrine of first principles of reality that
Numenius finds adumbrated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> <em>Letter</em>
attributed to Plato (fr. 24.51&ndash;6). For Numenius it is primarily
the disagreement of the Academic skeptics with Plato&rsquo;s allegedly
dogmatic philosophy that marks a failure. The surviving fragments of
this work indicate Numenius&rsquo; strong concern with the history of
Platonism and are quite telling as to the tendencies of Platonism at
this time. Presumably Numenius&rsquo; reaction against a skeptical
interpretation of Plato were triggered by attempts chronologically
close to him, such as those by Anonymous in <em>Theaetetum</em>
(1<sup>st</sup> c. CE?), Plutarch, and Favorinus
(1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup> c. CE), to revive a form of academic
skepticism (see Opsomer 1998), which Antiochus of Ascalon (1st c. BCE)
had rejected as alien to Plato&rsquo;s philosophy (see Karamanolis
2006, 44&ndash;59). Three other works of Numenius, namely <em>Epops,
On Numbers, On place</em> (Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em> IV.51; fr.
1c), were consulted by Origen but are only titles to us (see Zambon
2002, 180&ndash;181 and Jourdan 2023, 21&ndash;23 for some speculation
about their possible subject-matters).</p>

<h2 id="NumePlat">2. Numenius&rsquo; Platonism</h2>

<p>
The remains of Numenius&rsquo; work leave no doubt that he relied
primarily on texts of Plato in constructing his own system of
principles. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those
that classify him as a Platonist philosopher (Porphyry, <em>Life of
Plot</em>. 14.12, Eusebius, <em>Praep. Ev</em>. XI.21.7) and those
that consider him a Pythagorean (Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em> I.15,
VI.51, V.38; frs. 1b&ndash;1c, 53, Porphyry, <em>Ad Gaurum</em>
34.20&ndash;35.2; fr. 36, Calcidius, <em>In Timaeum</em> 297.8
Waszink; fr. 52.2 Des Places). We should not see any contradiction or
even tension in this double classification. Numenius is a Pythagorean
Platonist like Moderatus half a century earlier or Eudorus around the
turn of the millennium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and
Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he
regarded Plato&rsquo;s authority as subordinate to and dependent on
that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true
philosophy&mdash;including Plato&rsquo;s own (see Frede 1987,
1047&ndash;1048, Mansfeld 1992, 298, Jourdan 2021a). For Numenius
Pythagoras&rsquo; views, like those of Socrates, were originally
passed on only orally (cf. fr. 24.57&ndash;60), while Plato instead
wrote many philosophical works, in which he communicated the
Pythagorean and Socratic doctrines. Interestingly, Numenius&rsquo; two
authorities, Pythagoras and Plato, represent two different kinds of
sources of philosophical tradition, an oral and a written one.</p>

<p>
This view of Numenius is part of a more general view about the history
of philosophy that we can reconstruct from his fragments. Numenius
believes that the truths given to us by philosophy have a status like
that claimed for the scriptures by revealed religions: they are the
revelation of <em>logos</em> (reason) in which all nations have a
share (frs. 1a, 1b) but which only certain inspired intellectuals
could articulate properly and explain for the first time. Numenius
appears to believe that the religious practices of the various nations
are philosophically significant, because they contain some lore or
&ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; that reflects philosophical truth, which means
that religious practices can be recast in a philosophical account, in
the same way that this was claimed for poetic episodes and myths (e.g.
Homer&rsquo;s cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey recast later by
Porphyry in his <em>De antro Nympharum</em>). We find a similar view
first in Posidonius (1<sup>st</sup> c. BCE) (in Seneca,
<em>Epist.</em> 90.5&ndash;13, 20&ndash;25, 30&ndash;32; fr. 284
Edelstein-Kidd) and then it appears in variations in several authors
of the first two centuries CE. The Platonist Celsus, for instance, who
must have been Numenius&rsquo; contemporary, wrote a work entitled
<em>True Account</em>, in which he criticizes Christianity for
deviating from the fundamental original wisdom that he takes to lie
behind the religions of many nations (Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em>
I.14, 16; see Frede 1994, 5193&ndash;5198). A similar view is
maintained by Plutarch (fr. 157.16&ndash;25 Sandbach; cf. his <em>On
Isis and Osiris</em>) but also, quite significantly, by the
1<sup>st</sup> c. CE Stoic Cornutus in his <em>Introduction to Greek
Theology</em> (see Boys-Stones 2001, 49&ndash;59, 105&ndash;114,
Boys-Stones 2018c). It is apparently because Numenius took such a view
of the religious practices of other nations that he was quite
interested in the oriental traditions including the jewish one (see
Jourdan 2021b). This view of Numenius suited well Christians like
Eusebius, the source of Numenius&rsquo; quotations, who wanted to
argue that the true doctrines of Plato derive from other intellectual
traditions, transmitted by sages such as Pythagoras and Moses (see
Michalewski 2021, 131).</p>

<p>
Numenius maintains that in the Greek tradition the revelation coming
from reason was first grasped and articulated in properly
philosophical terms by Pythagoras, the source of true philosophy; it
then found its way into the philosophy of Plato. Numenius argues that
Plato appropriated Pythagoras&rsquo; doctrine and outlined it in his
own work (fr. 24.56&ndash;62). He suggests that Plato accessed
Pythagorean philosophy directly, presumably through his own
acquaintance with Pythagoreans, but also, and this is quite
remarkable, indirectly through Socrates, who, according to Numenius,
was also philosophically a Pythagorean and was communicating to his
pupils Pythagorean doctrines (fr. 24.51&ndash;59), most especially the
doctrine of the three gods (see below, Metaphysics), which is
allegedly outlined in the pseudo-Platonic 2<sup>nd</sup>
<em>Letter</em> (312e). Numenius appears to suggest that Plato alone
among his contemporaries was in a position to recognize
Socrates&rsquo; Pythagoreanism because, before meeting him, Plato had
already familiarized himself with Pythagorean philosophy (fr.
24.57&ndash;59; see Michalewski 2021, 133&ndash;136). This is
strikingly different from Antiochus&rsquo; perception of Socrates as a
source of scepticism which Plato abandoned in his mature works
(Cicero, <em>Acad. Pr</em>. 15&ndash;18, Karamanolis 2006,
50&ndash;54). On Numenius&rsquo; view Plato speaks with authority in
his many and extensive published works precisely because he
communicates Pythagorean doctrines which he had drawn from Pythagoras
and Socrates, but to the extent that Plato&rsquo;s philosophy is
derivative from the Pythagorean one, the authority of Plato&rsquo;s
written work is inferior to that of Pythagoras (frs. 7.5&ndash;7,
26.12&ndash;22; see further Boys-Stones 2018b, 198&ndash;199). This is
why Numenius recommends a move away from Plato towards the discourses
of Pythagoras (fr. 1a). We have, then, to do with a descending order
of authority, that of ancient wise men including Pythagoras, then
Socrates, then Plato, after whom a clear decline starts with
Plato&rsquo;s successors in the Academy (cf. frs. 23, 24 Des Places).
Numenius appears to claim even that Plato was not completely faultless
for the decline of Pythagorean philosophy that happened with the
Academics. Plato, Numenius suggests, did not present his doctrines
sufficiently clearly. This is why Numenius holds Plato partly
responsible for the departure of later Platonists (i.e. the Academic
skeptics) from Plato&rsquo;s actual Pythagorean philosophy (fr.
24.60&ndash;66; Karamanolis 2006, 130&ndash;131). Plato&rsquo;s
obscurity is pointed out by several other Platonists in late
antiquity, such as Plutarch (<em>On Isis and Osiris</em> 370E-F,
<em>On the Obsolescence of the oracles</em> 421F) and Plotinus
(<em>Ennead</em> IV.4.22.6&ndash;12), but none of them means this to
be a criticism of Plato, as is apparently the case with Numenius,
whose point is that Plato did not make sufficiently clear his
intellectual debt to Pythagoreanism and that this may have played a
role in the dissension of his followers in the Academy (see further
Jourdan 2021a). Eusebius highlights this view of Numenius in order to
support his own apologetic argument that paganism is marked by
dissent, which in the case of Plato, is of a particular kind, namely
Plato depended on higher authorities such as Pythagoras, while
Platonists starting with Aristotle started betraying Plato, and in
such a way, in Numenius&rsquo; view, they departed from
Pythagoreanism.</p>

<p>
Numenius continues the line of Eudorus and especially Moderatus of
Gadeira (1<sup>st</sup> c. CE), who also considered Plato to be a
Pythagorean in his philosophical commitments. But unlike Moderatus
(Porphyry, <em>Life of Pythagoras</em> 53) and other Pythagoreans (see
e.g., Photius, <em>Bibliotheca</em> cod. 249, 438b14&ndash;19) who
considered also later philosophers, such as Aristotle, as Pythagoreans
(for instance Ps. Archytas, the author of a commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>), Numenius apparently maintains
that nobody after Plato had access to the Pythagorean wisdom. This is
why he sets out to separate (<em>ch&ocirc;rizein</em>, fr. 24.68 Des
Places) Plato the Pythagorean from all later Platonists, who betrayed
the Pythagorean philosophy, which in Numenius&rsquo; view is the
essence of Plato. Numenius appears then to be a more rigorous
Pythagorean than his predecessors, Eudorus and Moderatus, let alone
other contemporary Pythagoreans. He sets out to defend the authentic
Pythagoreanism as is recast in Plato alone. This tension among
Pythagoreans is indicative of a vivid debate they were having about
the sources on which one can rely for the reconstruction of
Pythagorean philosophy. This debate in turn is characteristic of a
strong revival of the Pythagorean philosophy in the first two
centuries CE. This revival becomes manifest in a series of Pythagorean
pseudepigrapha of the same age. These are treatises which pass
themselves off as written in ancient times and as communicating
Pythagorean lore (see Centrone 1990, Ulacco 2017). It can also be seen
in the attempt of Moderatus to present Pythagorean doctrines
systematically in his <em>Pythagorean teachings</em> (<em>Pythagorikai
scholai</em>; Stephanus of Byzantius s.v. Gadeira, and Porphyry,
<em>Life of Pythagoras</em> 48; Karamanolis 2006, 132&ndash;134).</p>

<p>
The stress on Plato&rsquo;s Pythagoreanism on the part of Pythagoreans
revives and extends connections between Plato&rsquo;s metaphysics and
Pythagorean ideas, noted already by Plato&rsquo;s younger associates.
Already Aristotle spotted these connections (e.g. <em>Metaphysics</em>
A.6, M.3, N.3). That early Academics like Xenocrates showed strong
interest in Pythagoras&rsquo; doctrines is presumably because they
took them to be present in, or close to, those of Plato. They even
wrote treatises on them (e.g. Diogenes Laertius IV.13). We also hear
that Plato was accused of having copied the <em>Timaeus</em> from
Philolaus&rsquo; book (Diogenes Laertius VIII.85) and in the
3<sup>rd</sup> c. BCE Timon of Phlius parodied Plato for this (Aulus
Gellius, <em>Noctes Atticae</em> III.17.4). The renewed emphasis on
the <em>Timaeus</em> in the work of Platonists of the first centuries
CE, such as Plutarch, which we can attribute already to Eudorus (see
Dillon 1977, 117&ndash;121), is closely associated with the revival of
Pythagorean Platonism. Platonists considered the <em>Timaeus</em> to
communicate Pythagorean doctrine and even argued that it was inspired
by the work of &ldquo;Timaeus Locrus&rdquo;, a late forgery in
pseudo-Doric dialect (cf. Proclus, <em>In Timaeum</em>
I.7.17&ndash;8.29). Numenius is following ample precedent in assigning
a central role to the <em>Timaeus</em> for deriving a system of first
principles on the basis of Plato&rsquo;s metaphysics (Baltes 1975,
241&ndash;242). His interest in numbers (he wrote a work on numbers),
to which he assigns an ontological role (fr. 2.20&ndash;24) may well
be for him another doctrine that Plato had taken over from Pythagorean
philosophy (see Staab 2002, 99&ndash;100).</p>

<h2 id="Meta">3. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
The existing evidence about Numenius suggests that he was strongly
concerned with what we nowadays call metaphysics, that is, with the
structure of reality, which, as with Plato and Aristotle, also with
Numenius, includes ontology and theology. But as the remains of his
treatise <em>On the Good</em> show, we do not deal with two sets of
views here. Numenius defines the subject matter of this treatise as an
investigation of the question what is being (fr. 3.1, fr. 5.5, fr.
7.12&ndash;13), which is reminiscent of Aristotle&rsquo;s definition
of first philosophy, or metaphysics, in <em>Metaphysics</em>
<em>Gamma</em> (1003a20&ndash;32). Quite notably, however, Numenius
declares that he will be guided in his investigation by the
<em>Timaeus</em> (referring to <em>Timaeus</em> 27d-28a; fr.
7.8&ndash;12 Des Places). In line with the <em>Timaeus</em>, Numenius
treats the Good as the highest principle of everything there is, while
he introduces also lower and intermediate principles of reality that
he considers divine.</p>

<p>
As a true Platonist, Numenius maintains a sharp distinction between
the sensible and the intelligible world&mdash;the realms of becoming
and (true or pure) being respectively (fr. 16.8&ndash;10). In his
<em>On the Good</em> he proceeds in an ontologically ascending order,
starting with sensible (physical) entities, moving to the intelligible
ones (including Platonic Forms), and finally to the first principle,
the Good, that is the Platonic Form of the Good in the
<em>Republic</em> (508e) that he identifies with God (that is, the
first and highest god). Arriving at this description of the first
principle is the final aim of the treatise. This is understandable
since according to Numenius everything that exists in the world as it
is, depends on the Good, the God, which is the cause of
everything&rsquo;s goodness in the world (fr. 19.5&ndash;7 Des
Places). Beginning his investigation from natural elements
(<em>stoicheia</em>), namely earth, fire, water, and air (cf.
<em>Timaeus</em> 31b-c), Numenius argues that no such element can
possibly qualify as a being (as having being), first because elements,
like syllables, cannot exist by themselves but only in combination,
and secondly because no bodily entity whatever can qualify as a being
(as having being), because bodies are subject to change (fr.
3.1&ndash;8 Des Places). This means that all bodies have, at best,
being-and-not-being (cf. <em>Republic</em> 479c). What is more,
Numenius suggests that for a body to exist, there must be something to
keep it together and account for its unity (fr. 4b.11&ndash;19 Des
Places), and this cannot be a further body but rather must be a power
(<em>dynamis</em>; fr. 4b18), that is an intelligible entity, for
instance a soul, which is necessary to account for the unity of
bodies, as we see that it does for living things (fr. 4b). In the
<em>Timaeus</em> (33b), for instance, it is made clear that it is the
world-soul that keeps the body of the world together.</p>

<p>
Such an argument shows that Numenius has strong views about the
ontological status of matter, the basis, he supposes, of all bodies
(fr. 4b.25 Des Places). In his 4<sup>th</sup> c. CE Latin commentary
on the <em>Timaeus</em> Calcidius presents a long discussion about the
status of matter (<em>In Timaeum</em> p. 297.7&ndash;301.20 Waszink;
see further Reydams-Schils 2020, 118-138), claiming that this is based
on Numenius (fr. 52.2). If Numenius did elaborate on the status of
matter along the lines suggested in Calcidius, that must be because it
was crucial to do so for his argument about what qualifies as being
and also how the world has come into existence. Interpreting the
<em>Timaeus</em> literally, Numenius maintains that matter has never
come into existence, is uncreated and co-eternal with, and yet
distinct from, god (fr. 52.7&ndash;14; cf. Alcinous,
<em>Didascalicus</em> ch. 12, 166.15&ndash;30 Hermann), associated
with necessity (fr. 52.120&ndash;129), unlimited (<em>apeiros</em>),
indefinite (<em>aoristos</em>), fluid, without form and quality (fr.
3, fr. 52.6&ndash;14, 44&ndash;45; cf. Antiochus in Cicero,
<em>Lucullus</em> 27, Alcinous, <em>Didascalicus</em> 163.6 Hermann;
see Jourdan 2014, O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 158&ndash;160). This does not mean,
however, that matter does not have a nature or substance of its own
(fr. 52.92). Clearly, Numenius like other Platonists of his age
follows Aristotle in identifying Plato&rsquo;s receptacle in the
<em>Timaeus</em> with matter, which Aristotle characterizes as non
being (<em>Physics</em> 192a3&ndash;14), formless and qualityless
(<em>De caelo</em> 306b17&ndash;19; cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 50d7). This
lack of form of matter amounts to lack of reason for Numenius
(<em>alogos</em>; fr. 4a.1&ndash;4; see Jourdan 2014, 142&ndash;144).
In the same vein already Plutarch (<em>De Iside</em> 374C f.)
identified matter with Poverty (<em>penia</em> that is informed by
Abundance (<em>poros</em>), giving a cosmological twist to
Plato&rsquo;s myth in the <em>Symposium</em> (203bf.). Since matter is
lacking reason, Numenius considers it in itself disordered
(<em>ataktos</em>) and unknowable (fr. 4.4&ndash;5). Because disorder
and division were taken to be essential characteristics of matter in
the earlier Platonist tradition, matter had been identified with the
indefinite &ldquo;<em>dyad</em>&rdquo; (fr. 52.1&ndash;14) that is
referred to in Aristotle&rsquo;s account of Plato&rsquo;s metaphysics
(<em>Met.</em> A6, 988a9&ndash;15; cf. Plato, <em>Parmenides</em>
149d2; see Baltes 1975, 255&ndash;6). This was widely maintained among
the Pythagorean Platonists (Sextus Empiricus, <em>Against the
Mathematicians</em> 10.261), including Eudorus (Simplicius, <em>In
Physica</em> 181.7&ndash;30, 281.5) and Moderatus (ibid.
231.8&ndash;9; see Frede 1987, 1052). Numenius follows precisely this
line of thought (frs. 11.15, 52.6). And since for Numenius disorder
amounts to badness, he considers matter to be bad, and indeed the
source and cause of all instances of badness and disorder in the world
(fr. 52.37&ndash;9, 63&ndash;64).</p>

<p>
Numenius might appear to maintain that disordered matter (cf.
<em>Timaeus</em> 30a) is animated by an evil world soul (fr.
52.64&ndash;5 Des Places), as might be suggested in <em>Laws</em> 10
(896e) (cf. Plutarch, <em>De animae procreatione in Timaeo</em>
1014D). However, Calcidius&rsquo; text, which preserves this view of
Numenius, suggests instead that matter is not animated by, but somehow
simply is the evil world soul, that is, matter has life of its own
(fr. 52.44&ndash;47, 66&ndash;67; see Baltes 1975, 247&ndash;248 but
also Deuse, 1983, 68&ndash;73, Phillips 2002, 237, Jourdan 2014, 145,
O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 162&ndash;165). This has been variously
interpreted. Presumably this is is not an evil soul of itself, but
rather the soul of matter (<em>silvae anima</em>; fr. 52.92; see
Jourdan 2014, 145&ndash;148). For a soul, if it animates anything,
cannot be really evil in doing so, as it is the principle of life, and
life is one kind of order and thus good (see Waszink 1966, 68&ndash;9,
Baltes 1975, 250&ndash;251, Frede 1987, 1053). Presumably matter is
the cause of an evil world soul which accounts for disorderly
movement, that is the place where this kind of soul manifests itself,
in the same sense that the human soul that is originally rational, an
intellect (see the section on Psychology below) becomes non-rational
when it enters the body (Jourdan 2014, 148&ndash;151). Perhaps then we
deal with one soul which turns from disorderly/bad, when in matter, to
orderly/good, when matter is ordered (see Boys-Stones 2018a,
224&ndash;225). The fact that for Numenius matter (that is, disorderly
matter) is bad, however, does not necessarily entail that the material
world is also bad, as Dillon (1977, 369) suggests, associating
Numenius with the Gnostic idea of an evil world. It actually seems
that quite the opposite is the case: for Numenius the world is good
because it is ordered due to the dominance of the highest
principle/god, the Good, and it makes a strong opposition to
disorderly matter, which qualifies as evil, an idea we find also in
the roughly contemporary with Numenius Chaldean oracles (88, 88, 128,
134, see Jourdan 2023, 193).  Besides, as Jourdan (2014,
143&ndash;144) has pointed out, matter is not placed at the level of
the highest god but rather at the level of the second one, the
demiurge, the source of providence in the world
(fr. 52.94&ndash;100).</p>

<p>
Now, for Platonists only intelligible entities can account for order
which amounts to goodness and only they can qualify as beings, neither
matter nor bodies. A Platonic Form, for instance, is responsible for
the ordered existence of the physical things it is the Form of. A soul
too accounts for the existence of living things, such as animals.
Since the world has an order of its own as a single well-ordered
whole, there must be such an intelligible entity that accounts for the
world&rsquo;s order, wherein its goodness or orderliness lies
(<em>kosmos</em>). Being the source of this comprehensive goodness,
this must itself be surpassingly good (frs. 16.14&ndash;15, 19, 20).
Platonists tended to identify this principle with the Form of the Good
in the <em>Republic</em> (508e), which is the source of all being. It
was also traditional among them to think of this principle as a divine
one, a God.</p>

<p>
Numenius, then, distinguishes two sources of reality, or two
ontological principles, god-the Good and matter (inspired by
<em>Timaeus</em> 47e-48a and Aristotle&rsquo;s report about
Plato&rsquo;s principles in <em>Metaphysics</em> 988a7&ndash;15) but,
as pointed out above, matter is not considered as a principle opposite
to the highest god-the Good but rather to the demiurge, the second
God. The Good stays rather above matter, which is why order prevails
in the world. Yet the crucial question for Numenius was how one should
think about this divine principle, the Good, what kind of god this is,
given that this is the source of everything there is. Numenius&rsquo;
position on this has much to do with his view on matter. Numenius
advocates a strong dualistic position. In this he is like Plutarch and
later Atticus follows them. Numenius&rsquo; dualism is different from
that of most contemporary Pythagoreans we know of, like those referred
to by Alexander Polyhistor (in Diogenes Laertius VIII.25), by Sextus
Empiricus (<em>Against the Mathematicians</em> X.261&ndash;2), by
Nicomachus of Gerasa (<em>Theologia Arithm&ecirc;tik&ecirc;</em> in
Photius, <em>Bibliotheca</em> cod. 187, 143a24), by Eudorus
(Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 181.10&ndash;30) and by Moderatus
(Porphyry, <em>On Matter</em> in Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em>
231.6&ndash;24). Those Pythagoreans postulated god or One, on the one
hand, and matter or the indefinite dyad, on the other, but they
maintained that god or One is the ultimate principle of everything
(Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 7.1&ndash;30); from it matter came into
existence through the total privation of form (ibid. 231.7&ndash;9).
Numenius appears to be reacting against this view, which is associated
specifically with Moderatus (fr. 52.15&ndash;23; see Kahn 2001,
133).</p>

<p>
Numenius rejects Moderatus&rsquo; view in favor of his own dualistic
position, presumably because he wants to avoid the implication of the
monistic position that god is the source of what is bad. This concern
seems also to motivate Numenius to distance god from matter as much as
possible. He thus distinguishes the divine demiurge, who creates the
physical world by imposing order on matter, from the highest god. In
Numenius&rsquo; view this highest god is metaphysically above the
demiurge (frs. 16, 17, 19&ndash;21); the highest god, which Numenius
also calls the first intellect (fr. 20.12), is inert or inactive (fr.
12.13, 15.2) and utterly simple (fr. 11.11&ndash;14), qualifies as
being itself (<em>auto on</em>; fr. 17.4) and as the source of being
(fr. 16.4&ndash;5, 9), while the demiurge is the source of generation
(fr. 16.5). Quite importantly, the highest god is absolute goodness
(frs. 16.4, 9&ndash;10, 20.12), identical with the Form of the Good
(fr. 20.5, 11). Unlike the Form of the Good in <em>Republic</em> VI,
however, that is beyond being, Numenius&rsquo; first god is being, and
indeed the source of it (fr. 2.14, fr. 16.10 <em>symphyton t&ecirc;i
ousiai</em>; see Jourdan 2023, 52&ndash;53). This is not at odds with
the <em>Republic</em>, since several passages in it describe the Good
as being (518c9, 526e3&ndash;4, 532c5&ndash;6; see Burnyeat 2005,
154&ndash;155). Numenius apparently takes stance in a debate among
Platonists as to whether the first principle is being or beyond being
(Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em> IV.64.14&ndash;28). Numenius actually
describes the first god as being (<em>ho &ocirc;n</em>), a phrase that
alludes to Exodus 3.14 (fr. 13.4). This Biblical reference has been
much debated and a number of alterations of the text have been
proposed (see Dodds 1960, 15&ndash;16, Baltes 1975, 262, Dillon 1977,
368, Tarrant 1979, Edwards 1989). None of these proposals is, however,
convincing, since Numenius frequently designates the first god as
being in his work (frs. 5.5&ndash;14, 6.7&ndash;8, 8.2; see Whittaker
1978, Edwards 1990b, 21&ndash;22, Burnyeat 2005, 149&ndash;162). Yet
this first god that is identified with being and absolute goodness,
remains &ldquo;alone, isolated, abandoned&rdquo; (fr. 2.9), which
suggests that this god, like Plotinus&rsquo; One, is unknown and
perhaps even unknowable (cf. Plotinus, <em>Enneads</em> V.3.14,
VI.9.3; see further Whittaker, 1993). Numenius thus sets himself apart
from those Platonists who identified the divine demiurge of the
<em>Timaeus</em> with the Form of the Good of <em>Republic</em> VI
(508e), but his view is adopted by Alcinous (<em>Didascalicus</em> ch.
10, 164.27&ndash;165.16 Hermann), who must be writing some decades
later than Numenius, which means, given the nature of Alcinous&rsquo;
work, that this view became widespread among Platonists. We also find
a similar description of the highest god in the Chaldean Oracles
(Chaldean Oracles 11; see Jourdan 2023, 151).</p>

<p>
Numenius faces two challenges. First, how can the first god be the
ultimate cause of everything, as it appears that it ought to be (fr.
16.1&ndash;2, 9), if it is inert? Second, how can this god be simple,
as Numenius has claimed, if it is, as he has also claimed, an
intellect that thinks? Numenius addresses these challenges maintaining
that the first or highest god, or first intellect, brings about a
second one (frs. 13, 21.7), in fact the divine demiurge, and uses this
second intellect as an instrument of its thinking (fr. 22.1&ndash;2).
It is not clear what this instrumental use (<em>proschr&ecirc;sis</em>
fr. 22.2) amounts to, but we find similar vocabulary in the
<em>Timaeus</em> (28a7) for the use of the Forms by the demiurge.
Plotinus also describes the Intellect as an instrument of the highest
principle, the One (<em>Enn</em>. V.4.1). It is clearer, however, that
the second intellect thinks of the Forms and creates by imposing them
on matter (fr. 18.10). Numenius is inspired again by the
<em>Timaeus</em>. On the basis of <em>Timaeus</em> 39e7&ndash;9
Numenius apparently believes that the demiurge encompasses all Forms
in him. To the extent that all other Forms exist by participating in
the Form of the Good (frs. 16.2&ndash;5, 46b&ndash;c), which is
identical with the first intellect, this intellect accounts also for
all the (other) Forms (Frede 1987, 1060&ndash;1063), while it is the
second god who actually thinks of them (see Jourdan 2023,
217&ndash;236; for an overview of the debate see Boys-Stones 2018b,
156&ndash;157, 166&ndash;167). Apparently, the demiurgic intellect needs a prior
cause that accounts for being, order, and goodness, while the highest
God needs another intellect so that goodness and order can bring about
something as the result of thinking (cf. O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 152).
Now, presumably the first intellect thinks only itself, like the
Aristotelian god of <em>Metaphysics Lambda</em>, and in this sense its
being and its object of thought are identical. If this is the case,
then the first god can be said to remain absolutely simple, pure
goodness, at rest and inert, being itself, while the second god is in
motion (fr. 15.3&ndash;4), is not simple, because it contains the
Forms of all entities, and is good only because of its relation to the
first god, the Form of the Good, a relation which Numenius describes
as &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; (fr. 16.15), or as
&ldquo;participation&rdquo; (frs. 19.9&ndash;11, 20.7&ndash;10). This
nonetheless does not mean that Numenius considers the demiurge to be
ignorant and a less than good creator and in this sense like the
demiurge of the Gnostics, as Dillon (1977, 369) has argued (cf.
O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 140). Although clearly the demiurge is not as good
as the first god, however, for Numenius the demiurge is a recipient of
the goodness of the highest god, the Good, which and in turn transmits
this goodness to the world which it brings into existence (frs. 14,16,
19), which means that he is not only aware of the highest God but also
collaborates with him (O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 156). In this respect
Numenius&rsquo; demiurge is clearly different from the malevolent
creator god of the Gnostics.</p>

<p>
Yet creation is a process which, according to the <em>Timaeus</em> (if
it is taken literally), can be divided into two stages, the demiurgic
intellect&rsquo;s thinking of the Forms of all entities and its
imposing them on matter. Numenius maintains that the demiurgic
intellect, the second god in his hierarchy, splits into two when
actually engaged in the creation in the world, that is, when he comes
in contact with matter, which is required for and involved in creation
(fr. 11). This is not easy to understand. We have evidence to suggest
that the demiurgic intellect engages in creation through a third god,
that is, a third intellect (frs. 21.3&ndash;5, 22.4), which is
thinking in a discursive way (<em>dianooumenon</em>; fr. 22.4), not in
the purely contemplative way in which the demiurgic intellect thinks.
This may mean that the third god sets out to articulate the Forms
present in the second god/intellect and apply them to matter
(Boys-Stones 2018c, 191, O&rsquo;Brien 2015, 156-157). And the split
of the second god into two may have to do with the fact that matter
divides because it inspires desire in the demiurge (fr.
11.13&ndash;16), presumably desire for imposing order and goodness.
Matter calls for order, as it has none; it is rather ruled by a
principle of disorderly movement, an evil world soul (fr.
52.65&ndash;70). When the demiurge rules over matter, he is then
divided into one intellect which continues contemplating the Forms and
another which imposes Forms on matter and thus orders matter (frs.
11.14&ndash;20, 16.10&ndash;12, 21.4&ndash;5). This third god is
conceived along the lines of the world-soul of the <em>Timaeus</em>;
it is perhaps fair to say that for Numenius the god that actually
engages in creation, that is, the third god, is in effect the
world-soul of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em> (Baltes 1975, 267). And
in this sense the third god is the principle of order in matter, which
had been so far ruled over by a principle of disorder, the evil world
soul. Numenius uses very metaphorical language, inspired by the myth
of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Statesman</em>, in order to present what the
demiurge does and how it thinks in doing it. He argues that it is like
a helmsman steering a ship using the Forms as instrument (fr. 18 with
<em>Statesman</em> 272e; cf. <em>Timaeus</em> 39e). Despite the
metaphorical language that leaves much uncertain, two things become
reasonably clear. First, this intellect, the third god which is
identical with the (good) world-soul, is also active in preserving
order and maintaining the world in existence (frs. 12.14&ndash;19, 18,
52.91&ndash;8). Secondly, the third god desires to create (fr.
11.16&ndash;20, 18.7&ndash;13), which amounts to saying that god, in
the person of this third intellect, wants to impose order in the world
because order is good (see Deuse 1983, 65&ndash;67). Since this third
intellect/god is directly responsible for the existence of the world,
it is ultimately not distinguishable from the world itself (fr. 21.3),
which according to <em>Timaeus</em> 34b1 is god, because it is this
which keeps the world together (see also Tarrant 1979).</p>

<p>
There is a question of how to understand Numenius&rsquo; hierarchy of
three gods. Should we take seriously Proclus&rsquo; testimonies that
suggest there are in fact three (frs. 21&ndash;22), or the fragments
of Numenius preserved by Eusebius which suggest that there are
actually only two (frs. 15&ndash;16, 20)? This is a much debated issue
in scholarship (see Boys-Stones 2018a, 156-157, O&rsquo;Brien 2015,
157&ndash;158, and most recently Jourdan 2023, who argues in favor of the
gods being two). The question becomes accentuated in view of
Numenius&rsquo; statement that the second and third gods are one,
using the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; in the singular (<em>estin</em>;
fr. 11.14&ndash;15) in referring to them together. In a way only the
first god is different in substance from the second and third, who
make up a unity. But as Frede (1987, 1057&ndash;1059) has argued
convincingly, the unity of the two gods does not mean their identity.
The demiurge is split into two because of the effect of matter. The
second god is divisible in the same way that some other intelligible
entities, such as human and animal soul, are (fr. 41.6). Soul remains
essentially the same in all animate beings and yet is divided, in the
process of ensoulment of the things that it makes animate. This is
probably the case with the demiurge as well; he is one operating in
two distinct roles. That Numenius proposed a hierarchy of three
distinct gods, rather than two (thus Holzhausen 1992, 253&ndash;254,
Jourdan 2023), or three aspects of one god (Kr&auml;mer 1964, 88), is
strengthened by the fact that Christians like Origen and Eusebius,
being Trinitarians, approve of his theology, although, as Jourdan
rightly observes (2015), they use Numenius for their view on Father
and Son.</p>

<p>
Numenius&rsquo; three gods are the principles of being (first God) and
generation (second and third god; fr. 16), and thus of everything that
exists. And because the highest god is absolute goodness, the world of
generation becomes good and beautiful (fr. 16.16&ndash;17). Numenius
must be credited with the idea that goodness is transmitted from the
highest god through the second, demiurgic intellect, through a third
intellect, to the world, without god actually doing anything (fr.
14.6&ndash;14), an idea further developed later by Plotinus and can be
found especially in his anti-Gnostic treatises, parts of the so-called
Grossschrift (<em>Enneads</em> III.8, V.8, V.5, II.9; cf. also
I.6).</p>

<h2 id="Psyc">4. Psychology</h2>

<p>
Like most contemporary Platonists, Numenius was much preoccupied with
the status of soul and its relation to body. First, some fragments
from Numenius&rsquo; treatise <em>On the Good</em> (frs. 2&ndash;4 Des
Places) show clearly that the treatment of the soul was extensive in
this work. Secondly, Numenius&rsquo; views on the soul are discussed
by several later Platonists, including Porphyry, Iamblichus,
Damascius, and Calcidius, while they can arguably be detected in
Macrobius&rsquo; <em>In Somnium Scipionis</em>. The main reason for
Numenius&rsquo; strong interest in the soul, especially the human
soul, must have been one which can be detected also in Plotinus: the
soul-body relation is paradigmatic for the relation between
intelligible and sensible reality in general. The former is an
instance of the latter, which means that we cannot grasp the one
independently from the other. Indeed Numenius&rsquo; views on soul and
its relation to body square well with his views on the relation
between intelligible and sensible reality.</p>

<p>
Porphyry reports that Numenius speaks of two souls, a rational and a
non-rational one (Porphyry in Stobaeus I.350.25&ndash;351.1 Wachsmuth;
fr. 44 Des Places), while Philoponus (<em>In de anima</em>
9.35&ndash;38; fr. 47) suggests that Numenius may have distinguished
also a third kind of soul, namely a vegetative one
(<em>phytikon</em>). To begin with Porphyry&rsquo;s testimony, this is
somewhat confusing because it does not make clear that Numenius
distinguishes two kinds of soul and not two souls in a human being (as
Merlan 1967, 103 claims), while it groups Numenius together with those
Platonists who distinguish parts of the soul (reason, spirit, and
appetite). This, however, is a different matter from that of
distinguishing different kinds of soul for different kinds of living
thing, although both distinctions can be held by a Platonist, and
possibly also by Numenius. Further evidence, though, corroborates the
conclusion that Numenius did distinguish at least two kinds of soul, a
rational one for humans and gods, and a nonrational one for animals.
The distinction of a third kind of soul for plants, though less well
attested, is perfectly possible given the testimony of
<em>Timaeus</em> 77b and given Numenius&rsquo; heavy reliance on the
<em>Timaeus</em>. Porphyry himself states that according to Numenius
the rational soul has an &ldquo;assenting faculty&rdquo; which
motivates all actions (fr. 45 Des Places). This reference to assent
suggests that Numenius operates with a notion of reason similar to
that of the Stoics and that, like the Stoics, he considers souls of
human adults to be nothing but reason. This view, though, does have
Platonic credentials, arguably going back to Socrates as he appears in
the <em>Protagoras</em>. This may explain why other Platonists
contemporary with Numenius, such as Celsus (Origen, <em>Against
Celsus</em> VIII.49), also endorse it. This picture is confirmed by
Iamblichus&rsquo; testimony, which suggests that there is a
fundamental opposition between Numenius&rsquo; two kinds of soul
(<em>On the Soul</em> in Stobaeus I.374.21&ndash;375.18 Wachsmuth, fr.
43.4&ndash;5), namely that the human soul, being rational or
intellectual, is in its essence that of gods (fr. 41.15&ndash;6; Kahn
2001, 130&ndash;1), while that of other animals, being essentially non
rational, is not. For Numenius the human soul is of the kind of the
divine soul, namely an immortal intellect (fr. 31.25&ndash;6), and in
this sense human souls have divine origin (fr. 52.73&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
Apparently Numenius sides with those (notably the Stoics) who believe
that possessing reason makes a soul fundamentally different from souls
devoid of reason, and that this is crucial both for the status of the
soul as such as well as for its relation to the body and perhaps also
for the related bodily functions. For Numenius functions of this kind,
such as perception, memory, and desire, are not essential to the soul
and are later additions to it (fr. 43.7&ndash;9), coming into
existence with its embodiment. Numenius apparently held that the human
soul is essentially an intellect that descended to human bodies
through the planets (fr. 12.14&ndash;16). This is a view that also
Celsus shared (Origen, <em>Against Celsus</em> VI.21; see Frede 1994,
5211), which we can find also in Hermetic treatises (<em>Corpus
Hermeticum</em>. I.25; Dodds 1960, 8). Origen also adopts the view
that the human soul is essentially an intellect that falls in bodies
and then becomes a soul with the necessary faculties to operate within
a human body, while retaining the ability to ascend and become an
intellect again (<em>On Principles</em> I.4.1, I.8.1, II.6.4, II.9.7).
Numenius must have made a similar distinction between the human soul
strictly speaking and the aspects of it that come about because of the
soul&rsquo;s embodiment (see Waszink 1966, 74, Deuse 1983, 76, Jourdan
2014, 157&ndash;161 esp. with regard to the relevant testimony of
Calcidius). Most probably Numenius arrived at this view being guided
by the analogy of the Cave, the story of Er, in <em>Republic</em> VII
and X respectively, the soul being similar to the sea-god Glaucus in
<em>Republic</em> X (611) whose first nature has been obscured by
layers of attached materials, but also by the description of the
creation of the soul in the <em>Timaeus</em> (41e), according to which
the demiurge mounts the souls on vehicles (<em>och&ecirc;mata</em>).
Porphyry in his work <em>The Cave of Nymphs</em> makes clear that he
relies on Numenius&rsquo; exegesis of the soul&rsquo;s descent to
bodies through the planets (frs. 30&ndash;33) and speaks of the honey
offered by the astrologists in anticipation of the future pleasures of
the souls in earth (fr. 32). Apparently, pleasures draw the soul
towards the earth and also keep it attached to it, and it would be
reasonable to think that, as in Plotinus and Porphyry, the soul
according to Numenius must be liberated from them and turn towards its
intellectual self.</p>

<p>
Further light is shed in Macrobius&rsquo; long account about the
descent of the soul from the sky to the earth (<em>In Somnium
Scipionis</em> 1.12; test. 47 Leemans, omitted by Des Places), which
at least to some extent must be drawn from Numenius (thus Dodds 1960,
8&ndash;10 against Beutler 1940, 676&ndash;677; the extent of
Macrobius&rsquo; debt to Numenius is debated by Elferink 1968, Ley
1972, Baltes 1975, 252&ndash;3, Deuse 1983, 72&ndash;73). According to
Macrobius&rsquo; story of the soul&rsquo;s descent from heaven to
earth, the soul acquires a number of capacities necessary for its
functions in a body as it goes through the planets, such as the
capacity of theoretical thinking (<em>logistikon</em>) in Saturn, that
of practical thinking (<em>praktikon</em>) in Jupiter, the spirited
aspect (<em>thumos</em>) in Mars, the perceptual capacity
(<em>aisth&ecirc;tikon</em>) and imagination (<em>phantastikon</em>)
in the Sun, appetite (<em>orektikon</em>) in Venus, the linguistic
capacity (<em>hermeneutikon</em>) in Mercury, and finally the
vegetative functions (<em>phutikon</em>) in the Moon. As Frede (1987,
1072) has argued, the capacities acquired in the seven planetary
spheres correspond to the seven parts of the soul according to the
Stoics. It is crucial to stress that these acquired capacities neither
are essential to soul nor do they change what the soul actually is,
i.e. intellect (fr. 42). They rather are, as Iamblichus reports,
causes of evil (<em>On the Soul</em> in Stobaeus
I.374.21&ndash;375.18; fr. 43.7&ndash;9), as the soul loses its
simplicity and purity. Yet the evil is not due (or not only due) to
the capacities themselves, but rather to the accumulation of astral
matter while the soul descends through the planets. This is confirmed
by the testimony of Iamblichus according to which Numenius,
 Cronius,<sup>[<a href="render.cgi?login=gkaramanolis&amp;id=gkaramanolis&amp;role=au&amp;entry=numenius&amp;page=notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 and Harpocration consider all embodiments to be invariably bad (fr.
48.10&ndash;14) and is compatible with Numenius&rsquo; view that
matter is bad and the source of all that is bad (see above,
Metaphysics; cf. Dillon 1977, 375&ndash;376, Zambon 2002,
213&ndash;221, Jourdan 2014, 145&ndash;161, 170&ndash;174).</p>

<p>
When the soul is released from the body at death, then it remains only
what it is essentially, namely intellect (fr. 35.21&ndash;26). If this
is so, then for Numenius only the intellect is immortal. This,
however, conflicts with the report of Damascius (<em>In Phaedonem</em>
I.177 Westerink; fr. 46a Des Places, wrongly attributed to
Olympiodorus), according to which Numenius maintained that not only
the essence of the soul, the intellect, is immortal, but also
&ldquo;the ensouled condition&rdquo; survives death, that is, the sum
of all other psychic capacities (the ones connected to bodily
functions), and also with the report of Philoponus (<em>In de
anima</em> 3.35&ndash;38; fr. 47), according to which Numenius follows
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedrus</em> (245c) in maintaining that &ldquo;all
soul is immortal&rdquo; (Baltes 1975, 245&ndash;246, Deuse 1983, 77).
The immortality of the entire soul, though, would be incompatible with
the story of the soul&rsquo;s descent, according to which the rest of
the psychic capacities is acquired and not originally present in the
soul. Yet Numenius possibly distinguished between the immortality of
the intellect, and the immortality for the rest of the psychic
capacities. The intellect is immortal in the sense that it always
lives, while the irrational part of the soul is immortal in that it
survives death as its constituent capacities dissolve gradually into
the spheres from which they were originated. This is also the view
that Porphyry later takes (in Stobaeus 1.384.19&ndash;28, Porphyry fr.
453 Smith), who may well follow Numenius on this (see Smith 1974,
56&ndash;68, Karamanolis 2006, 292, and 2007). For Numenius the soul
is immortal strictly speaking only in its essence, that is as
intellect, being free from body, even the astral body or matter
accumulated during its descent. Numenius maintains that the human
rational soul may continue to live in other bodies and these may also
be bodies of animals if the soul becomes bad during its bodily life
(fr. 49; cf. Alcinous, <em>Didascalicus</em> 178.26&ndash;179.39
Hermann). Presumably such a life, however, is a form of
punishment.</p>

<h2 id="Infl">5. Influence</h2>

<p>
Numenius had a powerful influence on contemporary and later
philosophers, pagans and Christians alike. His impact was particularly
pronounced on Plotinus and on many Platonists of Plotinus&rsquo;
generation. It is possible that Numenius exercised some influence
already on Ammonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus and the Christian
Origen (see Nemesius, <em>De natura hominis</em> 69&ndash;72 Matthaei;
fr. 4b Des Places), given that all of Ammonius&rsquo; students about
whom we know anything show quite some respect for and knowledge of
Numenius&rsquo; thought despite their disagreements on specific topics
in Platonist philosophy. The main issue, however, which divides
Ammonius and his followers from Numenius is the number of the
intelligible principles. The pagan Origen, another student of
Ammonius, is a rigorous monist, holding that the supreme god is also
the creator of the universe (Porphyry, <em>Life of Plotinus</em> 3.32,
Proclus, <em>Platonic Theology</em> II.4.9&ndash;22; see
Saffrey-Westerink, <em>Proclus Th&eacute;ologie Platonicienne</em>
vol. II, X-XX). Longinus, who studied both with Ammonius and the
Christian Origen (Porphyry, <em>Life of Plotinus</em> 20.36&ndash;37),
apparently also committed himself to this kind of metaphysical monism
(Proclus, <em>In Timaeum</em> I.322.18&ndash;26; Longinus fr. 60
M&auml;nnlein-Robert, 538&ndash;540), possibly in reaction to
Numenius, whose work he reportedly knew well (Porphyry, <em>Life of
Plotinus</em> 20.74&ndash;76). Also well acquainted with
Numenius&rsquo; philosophy was Cronius, Numenius&rsquo; contemporary
(frs. 46b 48), as well as Atticus (see above, Life and Work).
Numenius&rsquo; work was particularly appreciated by the early
Christians. The Christian Origen was reportedly a keen reader of the
works of Numenius as he was of Plato and of Pythagoreans other than
Numenius, like Moderatus and Nicomachus (Eusebius, <em>Ecclesiastical
History</em> VI.19.8). Indeed, Origen has an impressive knowledge of
Numenius&rsquo; work. This becomes evident in that he often refers to
Numenius and reports on his work in his <em>Against Celsus</em> (I.15;
fr. 1b, IV.51; fr. 1c, 10, V.57; fr. 29, V.38; fr. 53), which is
remarkable given that Origen normally cites only from Scripture (see
Kritikos, 2007, 406&ndash;7). Eusebius inherits precisely
Origen&rsquo;s appreciation of Numenius and he is the only ancient
author who has preserved us quotations from Numenius (Jourdan
2015).</p>

<p>
There are three reasons accounting for such a strong approval of
Numenius by the early Christians. First, Numenius is rare among his
contemporaries in showing respect for the Jewish tradition (frs. 1a-c,
8, 9); he is attested to speak of the religion of the Jews claiming
that their God is incorporeal (<em>Against Celsus</em> I.15; fr. 1b),
he is also reported as being a reader who practiced allegorical
interpretation of the statements of Moses and the prophets of the Old
Testament (ibid. IV.51; fr. 1c). Moreover, Numenius famously states
that Plato is like Moses speaking Attic Greek (fr. 8.13; see Whittaker
1967, Edwards 1990a), he even alludes to Jesus and he also speaks of
Moses and Egyptian sages (fr. 10a Des Places). Such attention to the
Jewish tradition is important for the early Christian theologians and
apologists who want to establish the superiority of the
Jewish-Christian tradition against that of the pagan culture. This
attention, however, is not motivated by historical concerns on the
part of Numenius but rather by philosophical ones. Numenius wanted to
show that the Jewish nation must be counted among the ancient ones
that have a share in <em>logos</em> and also that Moses had a
conception of the first principle similar to that of Plato, since both
identified god with being (see Burnyeat 2005, 155&ndash;156).
Secondly, Numenius&rsquo; doctrine of three divine principles of
reality can be read (and apparently was read) as analogous to the
Christian doctrine of the Trinity. To the extent that Numenius is an
exegete of Plato, Christians feel entitled to claim that Plato in the
2<sup>nd</sup> Letter foreshadows the doctrine of the Trinity, and use
this argument to try to convince the pagans that Christianity is not
something new but was anticipated in the best parts of the pagan
philosophical tradition, namely in Plato, according to Numenius
(Eusebius, <em>Prep. Ev</em>. XI.praef. 3, XI.20.1&ndash;3; see
Kritikos 2007, 407&ndash;9). Origen in particular was inspired by
Numenius&rsquo; distinction between the first god and the immediate
agent of creation, a second, creator god, a distinction which is meant
to preserve the immutability of the highest god (Origen, <em>Against
Celsus</em> VII.42&ndash;44, <em>Commentary on John</em> I.6.35;
Kritikos 2007, 409&ndash;416). Finally, Numenius is valuable for the
argument which Eusebius makes in his <em>Praeparatio Evangelica</em>
that the pagan philosophers disagree with each other and do not stick
to what Eusebius considers the best part of Greek philosophy, which is
Plato&rsquo;s philosophy (see above, Numenius&rsquo; Platonism).</p>

<p>
The extent of Numenius&rsquo; influence on Plotinus was debated in
antiquity. Plotinus&rsquo; students, Amelius and Porphyry, were
concerned to discredit the widespread charge of Plotinus&rsquo;
plagiarism of Numenius (<em>Life of Plotinus</em> 18.1&ndash;8,
21.1&ndash;9). Amelius, who is attested to have known Numenius&rsquo;
work by heart (ibid. 3.44&ndash;5), devoted a special work on this
topic, <em>On the Difference Between the Doctrines of Plotinus and
Those of Numenius</em> (ibid. 17.1&ndash;6). Porphyry discusses the
matter extensively in his biography of Plotinus (ibid. 17&ndash;18,
21.1&ndash;9), making reference to Amelius&rsquo; work mentioned above
as well as to Longinus&rsquo; claim that Plotinus&rsquo; works were
far superior in terms of precision to Numenius&rsquo;, Cronius&rsquo;,
Moderatus&rsquo;, and Thrasyllus&rsquo; (ibid. 20.71&ndash;76,
21.5&ndash;9). Clearly, however, several of Plotinus&rsquo; views
resemble those of Numenius: both distinguish three intelligible
principles, both consider matter to be evil, although Plotinus does
not raise it into a principle (see <em>Ennead</em> I.8), as Numenius
does, both maintain that the goodness of the highest principle reaches
down to the sensible world, and both consider the human soul to be
essentially an intellect (see further O&rsquo;Meara 1976, Dillon 2007,
Michalewski 2012).</p>

<p>
Amelius and Porphyry themselves are also much influenced by
Numenius&rsquo; philosophy, as later Platonists point out. Amelius
follows Numenius in maintaining that not only sensible entities but
also intelligible ones participate in intelligibles (Syrianus, <em>In
Met.</em> 109.12&ndash;14; fr. 46b). Porphyry also relies much on
Numenius especially in his doctrine of the soul (e.g. <em>Ad
Gaurum</em> 34.20&ndash;35; fr. 36, <em>On the faculties of the
soul</em> in Stobaeus Anthol. I.49.25a; frs. 44, 45), to the extent
that he is explicitly accused by Proclus of taking over
Numenius&rsquo; views (on demons, <em>In Timaeum</em>
I.76.30&ndash;77.23; fr. 37; see Waszink 1966, Zambon 2002,
171&ndash;250).</p>

<p>
Numenius&rsquo; influence goes beyond the contemporaries of Plotinus.
Iamblichus, Proclus, Syrianus, Philoponus and Damascius also draw on
his work, although not always with approval (see frs. 46a-51). Proclus
is particularly critical of Numenius. His criticism of Numenius has to
do with the way in which the latter distinguishes between first and
second god, the demiurge. Proclus accuses Numenius of counting the
first god together with the second, failing to acknowledge that the
first god is completely distinct from all other causes (Proclus <em>In
Tim.</em> I.303.27&ndash;304.22). Proclus argues that it is not right
to call the first god &ldquo;Father&rdquo; because the principle of
Father is posterior to the highest principle and because when Plato
speaks of &ldquo;Father and Maker&rdquo; (<em>Tim</em>. 28c3&ndash;5),
he is not referring to two distinct realities but rather to two names
pertaining to the demiurge, the second god or principle (<em>In
Tim</em>. I.30414&ndash;22). According to Proclus, then, Numenius,
despite his distinction of a principle higher than the demiurge, makes
the same mistake that Atticus and other Platonists of this generation
make, which is to attribute to the highest god functions of the
demiurge (see Michalewski 2021, 138&ndash;148; cf. Ferrari 2014). This
is why Proclus examines jointly Numenius, Harpocration, and Atticus
while speaking of the demiurge (<em>In Tim</em>.
I.303.25&ndash;305.16; see further Tarrant 2004).</p>

<p>
Numenius was also used extensively by Calcidius in his commentary on
the <em>Timaeus</em> (297.7&ndash;301.20 Waszink; fr. 52; see Phillips
2003, Reydams-Schils 2020, 163-171). Calcidius reports on Numenius in
the section of his commentary on matter (295&ndash;299), and more
specifically, in the part in which he presents the Pythagorean
doctrine of matter (<em>In Tim</em>. 295). Besides that, recent
research has established intriguing parallels between Numenius&rsquo;
hierarchy of three gods and Calcidius theology (see Reydams-Schils
2007). Numenius is mentioned also by Macrobius in his <em>In Somnium
Scipionis</em> (frs. 54&ndash;55), a work that exerted considerable
influence in the Middle Ages, yet it is open to discussion to what
extent Macrobius knows and makes use of Numenius (see above, section
on Psychology, and Elferink 1968, Ley 1972).</p>
