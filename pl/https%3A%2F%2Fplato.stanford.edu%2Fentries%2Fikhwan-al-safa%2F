<p>
The Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; or &ldquo;Brethren of
Purity&rdquo;, as their name is commonly translated, are the authors
of one of the most complete Medieval encyclopedias of sciences,
antecedent at least two centuries to the best known in the Latin world
(by Alexander Neckham, Thomas de Cantimpr&eacute;, Vincent de
Beauvais, Bartholomaeus Anglicus, all dating back to the 13th
century). The &ldquo;encyclopedia&rdquo; is a collection of Epistles,
the Arabic title of which is <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; wa Khull&#257;n al-Waf&#257;&rsquo;</em>
(Epistles of the Pure Brethren and the Sincere Friends). It consists
of extremely heterogeneous materials, reworked to represent the whole
educational training intended for an <em>&eacute;lite</em> (see
later). It is very well known, and a great deal of research into it
has been done by Eastern and Western scholars, but the variety of
topics addressed and the questions raised as to the identity and
ideology of its authors remain unsolved. In an isolated form, and
under a false attribution, some of these treatises came to the Latin
Middle Ages through the Spanish version by Maslama
al-Majr&#299;t&#299;, which is traditionally placed at the
beginnings of the 11th century. This already discussed chronology
(Carusi 2000, 494&ndash;500) is recently questioned by several
scholars. The development of research in this direction was encouraged
by the pioneer study, Fierro 1996, part. 94 and 106&ndash;108; cf.
also Hamdani 1978, 350; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 11&ndash;12 (see
infra).</p>

<h2 id="Aut">1. Authorship</h2>

<p>
The authors introduce themselves as a kind of
&ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo; (<em>ma&#703;&#257;shara</em>) of sages.
Their work is addressed to &ldquo;beginners,&rdquo; who may thereby
increase their knowledge. The literary scholar Ab&#363; Hayy&#257;n
al-Tawh&#299;d&#299; (922&ndash;32/1023), basing his work on the ideas of
his master Ab&#363; Sulaym&#257;n al-Mantiq&#299; (c. 912/c. 985),
and the Mu&#703;tazili theologian &#703;Abd al-Jabb&#257;r
al-Hamad&#257;n&#299; (c. 936/1025) have identified the names of
these authors. They are understood to be the <em>q&#257;d&#299;</em>
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Hasan &#703;Al&#299; b. H&#257;r&#363;n
al-Zanj&#257;n&#299; and his three friends, Ab&#363; Sulaym&#257;n
Muhammad b. Ma&#703;shar al-Bust&#299;, called al-Maqdis&#299;,
Ab&#363; Ahmad al-Nahraj&#363;r&#299; and al-&#703;Awf&#299;. All
of these men came from Basra and were linked to the Chancellery
secretary Zayd b. Rif&#257;&#703;a (cf. Stern, 1946; Stern, 1964).
The text of al-Tawh&#299;d&#299; is accurately examined in Kraemer
1986, 136, 230 ff. This authorship is now questioned by several
scholars, because the learned who transmitted the Epistles to
al-Andalus appears to be Maslama al-Qurtub&#299;
al-Majr&#299;t&#299;, not later than the first half of the 10th
century.</p>

<h2 id="NamDat">2. Naming and dating</h2>

<p>
With regard to the common denomination of &ldquo;Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;,&rdquo; the old hypothesis by I. Goldziher
deserves mention: according to which the name could have been borrowed
from the famous collection of fables of indo-persian origin
<em>Kal&#299;la wa Dimna</em> to indicate a group of loyal friends.
However, Stern (1964, 421) considers the name to be a hint at an
idealised, utopian Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; movement that
pursues the salvation of souls through the philosophically enlightened
beliefs expounded in the Epistles. The most convincing hypothesis
seems to be that which links the name to the content and goals of the
encyclopedia &ndash; the salvation of soul through attainment of
knowledge and purification of heart (Diwald 1975, 16&ndash;22).
Recently, Poonawala hypothesized &ldquo;Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;&rdquo; to be a pseudonym hiding the identity of
the authors (Poonawala 2015a, 264 and 272).</p>

<p>
As to the date, in the 19th century F. Dieterici proposed 961 to 986,
basing his estimate on the work of the seventeenth century
lexicographer H&#257;jj&#299; Khal&#299;fa and on the presence in
the treatises of verses by the famous poet al-Mutanabb&#299; (d.
965). Massignon (1913) used a verse by the poet Ibn
al-R&#363;m&#299; (d. 896) to establish these years as the earliest
possible date (cf. also Hamdani 1999, 76; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 12;
28&ndash;29), and took the latest possible date to be the one
indicated by the definition of sine (<em>al-jayb</em>) given by the
Ikhw&#257;n. Such definition is not yet the one provided by
al-Batt&#257;n&#299; (d. 929; reference to vol. I, p. 46 of the
Bombay ed., 1887 &ndash;1889, corresponding to I, 86, 14&ndash;15 of
the Beirut edition referred to in this article). The &ldquo;expected
event&rdquo; frequently mentioned in the encyclopedia would then be
the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, which can be traced back to those
years. On the basis of astronomical data, Casanova (1915) moved the
dates about a century forward, assigning the work to the years
1047&ndash;51.</p>

<p>
Until some decades ago, the almost universally accepted dating was the
one deduced from the testimonies of al-Tawh&#299;d&#299; and
&#703;Abd al-Jabb&#257;r al-Hamad&#257;n&#299; (see above, 1.
Authorship). Marquet reconfirmed Dieterici&rsquo;s earlier hypothesis,
placing the compilation of the work between 961 and 980
(al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;&rsquo;s testimony is dated 981), but he also
brought the date back to 909, depending on the hypothesis of an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; affiliation of the authors. Two
treatises have given rise to the idea of an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; interpretation: Epistle 48 <em>On the
invitation (da&#703;wa) to God</em> and Epistle 50 <em>On the kinds
of administration</em>. The encyclopedia would therefore be the oldest
exposition of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; doctrine, and
consequently, the &ldquo;expected event&rdquo; might have been the
proclamation of the Fatimid caliph &#703;Abd All&#257;h
al-Mahd&#299; in Ifr&#299;qiya, which happened in that year (Marquet
1981, 95; Marquet 1972, 66). Abbas Hamdani, an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; scholar, summarizes various opinions
concerning the dates of the encyclopedia, and establishes that it was
composed in its whole between 873 and 909 (Hamdani 1978; Hamdani 1999,
78; Hamdani 2008; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 15&ndash;16; Poonawala sides
with Hamdani&rsquo;s chronology in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017,
307&ndash;308). Hamdani also thinks that the Ikhw&#257;n awaited the
advent of the Fatimids, the Fatimid character of the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> not being in question (Hamdani 1979, 62);
he configures a precise role of the <em>im&#257;m</em> in Epistle 48
(Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 6). The fourth section, apart from the first
and the last treatises, is claimed to be the core around which the
first three sections have been composed (Marquet 1998, 5), as well as
the culmination of the epistles, which demonstrates the importance of
the mystery of prophecy and of imamate (Marquet 1998, 8&ndash;9 and
note 21). Also Madelung recently sided with the hypothesis of an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism of the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;.
Recalling that the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis of Mashriq, Iraq and
Iran did not recognize the claims of &#703;Abd All&#257;h to be the
expected <em>im&#257;m</em>, being rather committed to the Qarmat
mission, Madelung hypothesizes that the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis of
Basra recognized as <em>im&#257;m</em> the member of the family who
had remained hidden in Khur&#257;s&#257;n, the same person who would
also become the founder of the secret brotherhood of the Ihw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; (Madelung in print; but cf. De Smet 2017, 152,
note 1). Madelung&rsquo;s claim that the epistles are &ldquo;under the
auspices of the hidden seventh imam&rdquo; is rejected by Poonawala,
since &ldquo;Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&rsquo;s name is
never mentioned in the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>&rdquo; (Baffioni,
Poonawala 2017, 303&ndash;305, also on the basis of Hamdani&rsquo;s
opinions).</p>

<p>
A quite different chronology is proposed by de Callata&yuml; based on
the astronomical cycles described in Epistle 36 <em>On cycles and
revolutions</em>. He distinguishes three &ldquo;medium
conjunctions&rdquo; of Saturn and Jupiter occurring every 240 years
and a longer conjunction occurring approximately every 960 years. The
year 571 (birth of the Prophet Muhammad) marks a &ldquo;longest
conjunction&rdquo; (from Libra to Scorpio); the first &ldquo;medium
conjunction&rdquo; in 809 is of no importance to the Ikhw&#257;n; the
second (from Sagittarius to Capricorn) should take place in 1047, and
would be the &ldquo;imminent conjunction&rdquo; described in Epistle
48; the third (from Capricorn to Aquarius) is awaited in 1286; and the
&ldquo;longest conjunction&rdquo; (from Aquarius to Libra) will take
place in 1524 and will correspond to the rising of the
<em>q&#257;&rsquo;im</em> of the Resurrection (de Callata&yuml; 2005,
55&ndash;57; Walker <em>et al.</em> 2015, 150&ndash;152, 156,
204&ndash;206).</p>

<p>
The authors of the encyclopedia have also been confined to a
Mu&#703;tazilite approach, or placed in an earlier age, under the
Qarmat influence (Marquet 1977; Qarmats were the opponents of the
Fatimid caliph &#703;Abd All&#257;h al-Mahd&#299;). So did Madelung
many years ago; but considering his recent opinion, that the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> repudiate the Fatimids&rsquo; claim to
the imamate on the basis of the fact that a new-born of eight months
does not survive (that meaning that Muhammad ibn
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l did not reach the Prophet&rsquo;s rank; the
relevant texts are studied in Baffioni 2016 and 2018), Poonawala
wonders how he could ascribe the epistles to the Qar&#257;mita, since
this is a repudiation of the Qar&#257;mita&rsquo;s belief (Baffioni,
Poonawala 2017, 305&ndash;307).</p>

<p>
More recent studies, on the line of a seminal article by Fierro
(Fierro Bello 1996; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 11&ndash;12, but also
Carusi 2000), have identified Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Q&#257;sim Maslama b.
Q&#257;sim al-Qurtub&#299;, called al-Majr&#299;t&#299; (d. 964,
previously confused with the Spanish scientist and astronomer Maslama
al-Majr&#299;t&#299;, d. 1007) as the author of the encyclopedia
(cf. Hamdani 1999, 75; de Callata&yuml; 2013, Kacimi 2014a, b, de
Callata&yuml;, Moureau 2015). However, the one who introduced in Spain
the whole work is still to be considered Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-&#7716;akam
al-Kirm&#257;n&#299;, d. 1066). Because of this new discovery, the
timing of the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> has been anticipated of
several decades at least. So, the old attribution of
al-Tawh&#299;d&#299; and &#703;Abd al-Jabb&#257;r was revoked in
doubt, beginning with de Callata&yuml; who had previously accepted it
(de Callata&yuml; 2014; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 14&ndash;15; a
reconstruction of the journey, material and intellectual, of Maslama
al-Qurtub&#299; in al-Andalus is in de Callata&yuml;, Moureau 2017).
Maslama al-Qurtub&#299; has been also recognized as the author of
<em>Rutbat al-hak&#299;m</em> (&lsquo;The level of the wise
man&rsquo;) and <em>Gh&#257;yat al-hak&#299;m</em> (&lsquo;The goal
of the wise man&rsquo;, being known in Latin as <em>Picatrix</em>),
two important works on alchemy and magic respectively. These works
were traditionally attributed to the scientist al-Majr&#299;t&#299;,
but are now believed to date from the first half of the 10th century.
Scholars have also emphasized the impact of the encyclopedia on these
two works, and it has even been hypothesized Maslama to be one of the
authors of the epistles (Carusi 2000), which should not date later
than 950. In the light of this new chronology, de Callata&yuml; 2014
examines the possible influence of the Ikhw&#257;n on the
<em>b&#257;tin&#299;</em> (&lsquo;esoterist&rsquo;) thinker Ibn
Masarra (d. 931), especially on his cosmology, reporting this author
to the Andalusi <em>b&#257;tin&#299;</em> context of the first half
of the tenth century. If the epistles were circulating in al-Andalus
already before 950, and their compilation must have begun some time
before in the East, another consequence is that the Ikhw&#257;n
influenced al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; and not vice versa, as it was
believed so far (Hamdani 2011). According to Poonawala, the
encyclopedia was composed after al-Kind&#299; (d. between 864 and
870) but before al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 950; Poonawala 2011,
Introduction, 59). It is said that Maslama b. Q&#257;sim
al-Qurtub&#299; kept his identity secret while writing during the
period when the followers of Ibn Masarra were persecuted by the Maliki
jurists, who were the champions of the Umayyad caliphate&rsquo;s
orthodoxy in al-Andalus. In the <em>Rutba</em>, reference is made to
certain <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>. Fierro interprets this as an
allusion to the encyclopedia, setting its latest possible date of
completion at 936. At this time, Maslama was in Basra, where he may
have encountered the encyclopedia&rsquo;s authors. He would later
introduce the epistles to al-Andalus. Carusi 2000 claims that Maslama
considered the fifty-one epistles of the Brethren of Purity to be the
basis for his own work. Kacimi 2014a, 33 believes that these epistles
differ from those of the Ikhw&#257;n, despite the possibility of
mutual influence or shared sources.</p>

<p>
Later, Godefroid de Callata&yuml; (2013) reconsidered the issue and
highlighted the ambiguity in Sa&#703;&#299;d
al-Andalus&#299;&rsquo;s (d. 1070) account of how the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> were imported into al-Andalus by
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Hakam al-Kirm&#257;n&#299; (d. 1066), who was a
student of the scientist al-Majr&#299;t&#299;. According to de
Callata&yuml;, Tawh&#299;d&#299;&rsquo;s testimony does not enable
us to determine whether the individuals he mentions were the authors
of the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> or merely the
transmitters/compilers of an earlier, possibly much older version. De
Callata&yuml; also recalls the hypothesis of Marquet 1978, who claimed
that the final part of the corpus must have been written shortly
before or after 909, the year that the Fatimid caliphate was founded
in Ifr&#299;qiya. Hamdani also claims that the epistles are an
expression of pre-Fatimid Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism, composed
between 873 and 909. De Callata&yuml; believes that Maslama
&ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; the epistles while claiming not to be their
author and placing them in a different time and context to his own.
However, Maslama played a key role in copying and circulating the
epistles in the Islamic West, long before the scholar
al-Kirm&#257;n&#299;, mentioned by Sa&#703;&#299;d
al-Andalus&#299;. De Callata&yuml;, on the other hand, considers
Carusi&rsquo;s suggestion that Maslama may have belonged to the
Brotherhood in the East to be purely speculative (de Callata&yuml;
2013, 336). These ideas are taken up and further detailed in de
Callata&yuml;, Moureau 2016. Among those who sustain the attribution
of the epistles to Maslama al-Qurtub&#299; is also Madelung who,
therefore, rejects a too high dating of the epistles. The scholar has
speculated that Maslama not only brought the encyclopedia to Spain,
but also contributed to its composition: there would have been a first
version, no longer existing, compiled not long before 937, the one
described by al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;, and consisting of previously
existing epistles and of epistles especially composed for the purpose;
the Brotherhood would have been founded a few decades earlier
(Madelung 2018, 404). Therefore, it can be assumed that the scientist
al-Majr&#299;t&#299; brought only a few treatises to al-Andalus,
whereas his disciple al-Kirm&#257;n&#299; was able to import them in
their entirety (Kacimi 2014a, 39 and 41&ndash;43; Kacimi 2017, 743 and
745). He considers likely that the author of the <em>Rutba</em> might
have belonged to the group of the Brethren of Purity, as proposed by
Carusi (Kacimi, 2017, 748; Kacimi, 2014b, 43). This theory was also
adopted by Madelung 2018, 406.</p>

<p>
In recent times, al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;&rsquo;s and &#703;Abd
al-Jabb&#257;r&rsquo;s attribution has been reconsidered by
emphasizing the Fatimid militancy of some among the pretended authors
of the encyclopedia (Reymond 2011, 124&ndash;125). Hamdani recalls
that, according to al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;, such personages were
Qarmats, so that al-Tawh&#299;d&#299; could accuse of eresy Zayd b.
Rif&#257;&#703;a, too (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 7&ndash;8, where the
testimony of al-Qift&#299; is also discussed &ndash; that the alleged
authors were followers of the <em>im&#257;m</em> &#703;Al&#299;).
Hamdani even exploits al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;&rsquo;s observation that
the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> were widely read, as further evidence
that they would have been written long before (cf. also de Vaulx
d&rsquo;Arcy 2019b). Kacimi (2014b, 31) thinks that, at the time of
al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;, it was still difficult to have all the
epistles available together. Poonawala shares historians&rsquo; doubts
on al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;&rsquo;s reliability and concludes that his
one &ldquo;is certainly a hostile witness&rdquo; that implies the
authors&rsquo; affiliation with the Qar&#257;mita of Basra (Baffioni,
Poonawala 2017, 294). Following Hamdani&rsquo;s
&ldquo;deconstruction&rdquo;, the witness is considered to be
&ldquo;very suspicious&rdquo;, all the more so if one considers that
most medieval authors and modern scholars are used to equate the
Qar&#257;mita with the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis (Poonawala in
Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 298). Poonawala also emphasizes
Stern&rsquo;s remark on the <em>q&#257;d&#299;</em>
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Hasan &#703;Al&#299; b. H&#257;r&#363;n
al-Zanj&#257;n&#299; &ndash; that &#703;Abd al-Jabb&#257;r writes
against the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis without mentioning the
Brethren at all (Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 301&ndash;302).</p>

<p>
De Callata&yuml; (2021) reconsidered the impact of the epistles on the
<em>Rutba</em> and the <em>Gh&#257;ya</em>, basing his conclusions on
textual evidence. In the <em>Rutba</em>, Maslama reveals far less
familiarity with the encyclopedia &mdash; including the second version
of the frequently quoted <em>Epistle on Magic</em> &mdash; than in the
<em>Gh&#257;ya</em>. Therefore, contrary to his previous assumption,
de Callata&yuml; hypothesizes that Maslama had no access to the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> before he began writing his last work.
This once again indicates that Maslama was not the author of the
epistles, but may have circulated them in Spain. The allusions to the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> in the <em>Rutba</em> suggest that
Maslama wanted to convince his readers that studying his work would
make approaching the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> unnecessary, which
may also explain why he was ambiguous about their authorship. While
writing the <em>Gh&#257;ya</em>, Maslama undoubtedly had a copy of
the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> in front of him, although how he
obtained it remains unclear. The reason he did not explicitly refer to
the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> in the <em>Gh&#257;ya</em> may be
that he &ldquo;adopted the common practice of not explicitly
acknowledging his debt to this notoriously unorthodox collection of
writings stemming from the East&rdquo; (De Callata&yuml; 2021,
509).</p>

<p>
A new hypothesis on the real author of the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> has been formulated in Guillaume de Vaulx
d&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation. The author tries to
demonstrate that Ahmad b. al-Tayyib al-Sarakhs&#299;, a pupil of
al-Kind&#299;, composed the whole encyclopedia in about 894 in the
form in which we read it now (de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy 2016, partially
reelaborated in de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy 2019a). The core of the
author&rsquo;s argument &mdash; that the encyclopedia has a
predominantly mathematical value, revealed through its presumed author
and helping us to reconstruct al-Kind&#299;&rsquo;s thinking on
mathematics &mdash; was presented in de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy 2019c.
This time, the comparison is with an earlier version of
Nicomachus&rsquo;s Introduction to Arithmetic in relation to that of
Th&#257;bit b. Qurra, which is attributed to Sarakhs&#299;.</p>

<p>
But the questions of the identity and ideology of the Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; still remain unsolved. Kacimi 2016 has come back
to the relationship between the Ikhw&#257;n and the Sufi thought.
Poonawala refuses them to have been Sufi, though some MSS, included
the MS Atif Efendi 1618 (dated 1182, on which the new edition of the
Institute of Ismaili Studies is based), bear in the title the mention
of the Sufi school &ndash; or doctrines. Mayer thinks that to result
from a later, Sunni manuscript tradition, &ldquo;in which the
acceptance, or at least toleration, of esoteric material was made
likelier by presenting it as proper to &#7778;&#363;f&#299; circles,
whose respectability [&hellip;] had been established by a figure of
the magnitude of Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rdquo; (Traboulsi et al. 2016,
7).</p>

<p>
The traces of classical thought in the encyclopedia, as well as their
literary form, equally give an indication that the work was assembled
in the course of several decades between the 9<sup>th</sup> and the
first half of the 10th century, and that it may have undergone further
elaborations. Such a collective enterprise can be considered as the
result of a &ldquo;stratified&rdquo; compilation. The supposed
reworking of the whole by members of the Brotherhood might also have
shifted some Epistles from their original to their present place. Even
the headings of the four sections of the encyclopedia are misleading.
The way in which the treatises follow one another is often
inconsistent. The authors must have planned a special use of the
enormous amount of foreign philosophical and scientific knowledge that
is explained in the treatises and to develop it in relation to the
doctrinal conflicts and political changes that were occurring in their
own times. In this sense the presentation of the encyclopedia as a
&ldquo;popular&rdquo; work (Rudolph, 2004, 39) should be rejected.</p>

<h2 id="IdeCom">3. Ideological commitment</h2>

<p>
Because their aim is clearly salvation, it has often been supposed
that the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> were inspired by the
Sh&#299;&#703;ites, or perhaps even the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis,
both of whom claim the ideological commitment of the encyclopedia. For
Marquet (1975, 585) the encyclopedia is the most ancient general
exposition of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; doctrine. In 1150,
the Sunni orthodoxy in the person of the caliph al-Mustanjid judged
the work heretical and sent the existing versions to be burnt. Yet in
spite of this, the encyclopedia survived and was translated into
Persian and Turkish (Corbin, 1964, 193&ndash;194). A harsh judgment on
the Ikhw&#257;n was delivered by the famous Maml&#363;k muft&#299;
and theologian Taq&#299; al-D&#299;n Ahmad ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328).
He considered them as Sh&#299;&#703;i esotericists whose doctrines
contradict the religion of Islam. For this reason, he rejected the
attribution of the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> to such an eminent
religious scholar as Ja&#703;far al-S&#257;diq (Michot 2008).</p>

<p>
Attempts to define the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s ideological commitment
have been made, but there has been no consensus on the matter. The
Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s view of &#703;Al&#299; as the Prophet&rsquo;s
legitimate legatee (<em>wal&#299;</em>) persuaded some scholars to
link them to the <em>Sh&#299;&#703;a</em>, though scattered
references in negative terms to the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;
<em>im&#257;m</em> appear contrary to twelver Sh&#299;&#703;ism.
Other elements have been alleged as proofs of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; inspiration, such as the hierarchical
structure of universe, references to septenary cycles, distinction
between elect and masses, the use of Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;
symbols (e.g., the bee as symbol of the <em>im&#257;m</em>, etc.).
Already Stanislas Guyard in 1874 published a fragment of the
Ikhw&#257;n reporting it to Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism; and so Paul
Casanova in 1898, discovering a manuscript of <em>Ris&#257;la
al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> (Daftary 2007, 28 and 235; Hamdani, Soufan
2019, 10&ndash;11). Corbin (1964, 190) openly and radically affirmed
that the Ikhw&#257;n belonged to Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism. He
gave an esoterical interpretation of the religious, philosophical, and
the Brotherhood rites described in Epistle 50 (Corbin 1950). Hamdani
(1996, 146) considers this treatise to be &ldquo;the most explicitly
Sh&#299;&#703;i or Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;&rdquo; of the
entire encyclopedia. The main lines of Corbin&rsquo;s presentation are
shared, though in more nuanced terms, by Mattila 2016. Corbin was
followed by Marquet (1968, 1071) who stressed their attacks on
Mu&#703;tazilite and Ash&#703;arite ideas. Stern (1964,
416&ndash;417) and Diwald (1975, 26ff.) remarked that the Epistles
exercised their influence on the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis only from
the twelfth century. More recently, De Smet (2014&ndash;2015, 296)
noted that it was not until the 12th century that the Tayyibi
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis incorporated the Brethren of Purity to
support their philosophical systems. However, the epistles in
themselves can hardly be traced back to the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; sphere. The concepts and historical
ideas that are at least close to those of the
<em>Sh&#299;&#703;a</em> &ndash; such as deprecation of the
slaughter of Karbal&#257;&rsquo;, the allegorical interpretation of
the Qur&rsquo;&#257;n and prophecy, or the aversion to political
governments and the hope that they will fall when the present
septenary cycle comes to an end &ndash; show according to Stern (1964,
421) and later Bausani that the authors were representative of an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; tendency, but not of the official
<em>da&#703;wa</em> (propaganda) (Bausani 1977, 323; Bausani 1978,
14&ndash;16 and 267, note 1). Almost half a century later, in a
fundamental article, Krinis (2013, 311 and note 2) observed that the
Brethren belonged to a &ldquo;unique and highly influential
Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; circle&rdquo; in the
first three quarters of the 10th century. This, in opposition to
Netton 1991 who regarded the Brethren as representatives of Arabic
Neoplatonism. Considering Epistles 50 and 48, Bausani agrees, albeit
cautiously, on the hypothesis of an Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism of
the Ikhw&#257;n (Bausani 1978, 270; 278 and note 2), identified in
their &ldquo;encyclopedic&rdquo; approach to knowledge (Bausani 1985,
145; cf. also Daftary 1998, 2 and 83). Marquet 1973, on the other
hand, recognizes in the encyclopedia (in Epistle 48 in particular) the
official Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; organization at the time
(see also Marquet 1981, 95; Marquet 1998, 5, 7&ndash;8), and remarks
that the propaganda appeals here to philosophers, mystics, and rulers.
According to Hamdani (1996, 150), the event expected by the
Ikhw&#257;n is the advent of the Fatimids. Epistle 48, Marquet
claims, was written before 910, and almost entirely preserved in its
original form; but even if it was composed after the advent of the
Fatimids, its meaning would not have been perverted (Marquet 1984,
77&ndash;78). Other scholars have remarked that even when discussing
number seven, so linked to <em>Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;liyya</em>, the
Ikhw&#257;n criticize the &ldquo;supporters of the seven&rdquo;
(Hamdani 1979, 68; Netton 1996, 28&ndash;29).
Non-Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; ideas can also be found in the
work, for example the invitation to celibacy proper of Sufism (but for
contrary views see above). In general, the evidence supporting such
theories derives mostly from doctrines or parts of doctrines hinted at
in the encyclopedia. In denying the Brethren&rsquo;s
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; commitment, for instance, Netton
(1996, 28) remarks that, if the issue of such an allegiance is widely
debated, scholars have much less addressed the &ldquo;broader topic
[...] of whether the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; should even be
considered to be Muslims.&rdquo; The enormous variety of its contents
and, often, their inconsistency seem to have hindered scholars from
reaching unanimous conclusions on the authors&rsquo; religious (or
rather ideological) commitment and, consequently, on their goals. The
main lines of research in this field were resumed in Kraemer 1992,
165&ndash;178; cf. Hamdani 1999, 79; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 10
ff.).</p>

<p>
In De Smet 2022, the possible influence of Ab&#363; H&#257;tim
al-R&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s <em>A&#703;l&#257;m al-nubuwwa</em>
(&lsquo;The Signs of Prophecy&rsquo;) on
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s concept of the ruler of the
perfect city is examined. This does not imply that
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; was an Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;,
as the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; tradition considers the work
<em>z&#257;hir</em> (&ldquo;exoteric&rdquo;); it therefore circulated
freely outside the restricted circle of the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; community &ndash; and in fact was
widely disseminated throughout the Islamic world. There are also
notable similarities with the &ldquo;political&rdquo; epistles of the
Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;, although
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s terminology is Aristotelian, while
that of the Ikhw&#257;n is Neoplatonic. It could therefore be
hypothesized that the Ikhw&#257;n were not familiar with
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s political writings, which were
composed towards the end of his life. Like the <em>Kit&#257;b
A&#703;l&#257;m al-nubuwwa</em>, the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>
were not part of the esoteric literature of the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; <em>da&#703;wa</em> at that time and
were more widely disseminated than in the restricted circle of
initiates. Despite the recent links established between the
encyclopedia and Maslama al-Qurtub&#299;, De Smet eventually notes
that &ldquo;La position dominante encore aujourd&rsquo;hui accorde foi
au t&eacute;moignage d&rsquo;Ab&#363; &#7716;ayy&#257;n
al-Taw&#7717;&#299;d&#299; selon lequel les
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> auraient &eacute;t&eacute;
compos&eacute;es par un groupe de clercs a Ba&#7779;ra entre 360/970
et 370/980, donc apres la mort d&rsquo;al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, ce
qui signifie que les Ikhw&#257;n seraient tributaires du
philosophe&rdquo; (De Smet 2022, 83&ndash;84).</p>

<h2 id="ExtCor">4. The extant <em>corpus</em></h2>

<p>
The encyclopedia consists of 52 treatises divided into four sections
on the introductory (<em>al-riy&#257;diyya</em>), natural,
psycho-rational and metaphysical-theological sciences.</p>

<p>
Two additional Epistles, entitled &ldquo;Comprehensive Epistle&rdquo;
(<em>al-Ris&#257;la al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em>) and
&ldquo;Supercomprehensive Epistle&rdquo; (<em>Ris&#257;la
J&#257;mi&#703;at al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em>) are thought to
complete the <em>corpus</em> and explain its esoteric (hidden)
meanings. Two versions of the <em>J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> are extant.
One is currently ascribed to al-Majr&#299;t&#299;, the Spanish
scientist and astronomer who is alleged to have transmitted the
Epistles to Spain. Godefroid de Callata&yuml; (2014, 200) identifies
this personage with Maslama al-Qurtub&#299; (see above). The other is
ascribed to Ahmad ibn &#703;Abd All&#257;h ibn Muhammad ibn
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l ibn Ja&#703;far al-S&#257;diq, the second
of the three &ldquo;veiled&rdquo; (<em>mast&#363;r</em>)
<em>im&#257;m</em>s who were intermediate between Muhammad ibn
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l and &#703;Abd All&#257;h, the founder of
the Fatimid dynasty. Recent studies on aspects of this work by
Baffioni (2011b, 2012). According to De Smet, however, the existence
of the <em>im&#257;m</em> Ahmad is not grounded on any reliable
historical evidence (De Smet 2017, 154&ndash;155). The attribution of
the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;</em> and
of <em>Ris&#257;la al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> to one of the
&ldquo;hidden <em>im&#257;m</em>&rdquo; would be a late forgery
dating not beyond the 13th century (De Smet 2017, 157 and 160). The
<em>Ris&#257;la J&#257;mi&#703;at al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> is
also (Tamir s.d., 18) ascribed to Ahmad, which strengthens the link of
the <em>corpus</em> with the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;
tradition. While one cannot deny formal and substantial relationship
between the encyclopedia and the &ldquo;Comprehensive&rdquo; Epistle,
the &ldquo;Supercomprehensive&rdquo; Epistle is never cited in the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>, and it has been recognized by Kacimi
2015, 331 as an outcome of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lization of the
Ikhwanian corpus. Hamdani 2008 hypothesizes a more recent compilation
for the <em>Ris&#257;la al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em>. The Institute of
Ismaili Studies, London, is currently printing a new critical edition
of the <em>Ris&#257;la al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> by Mourad Kacimi,
the first to be conducted on a considerable number of manuscripts,
explicitly indicated and described in detail. The edition is
accompanied by a commentary and an annotated English translation by
Carmela Baffioni.</p>

<p>
Each Epistle of the encyclopedia starts by stating its particular
goal. All of them contain a core of technical teachings and a
conclusion regarding the <em>haq&#299;qa</em>, the inner meaning of
the contents. The texts contain frequent invocations to the learning
&ldquo;brethren&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the elect who are studying the
sciences &ndash; that enhance their didactical and exhortative style;
these invocations mean that the students will be awakened &ldquo;from
the sleep of matter and the negligence of ignorance&rdquo; if they
apply themselves assiduously to study &ldquo;with the assistance
(<em>ta&rsquo;yyid</em>) of a spirit coming by God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The Epistles vary in length and their style is plain. There are,
however, numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often
of Persian origin, and to mistakes in the transmission of the text.
Bausani (1978, 11) thinks the authors were of Persian origin (cf. now
Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 5). In general, however, the doctrines are fully
and clearly exposed, with repetitions where necessary to the didactic
function of the treatises.</p>

<p>
Diwald (1975, 12&ndash;15) has even wondered whether there were in
fact several authors of the encyclopedia because of the use at times
of the first person singular. The basic question, of course, is
whether the authors unify the doctrines of more numerous groups, as
suggested by the different contexts and even their
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>
The Ikhwanian encyclopedia is typical of the changes in Greek science
and philosophy during the tenth century as a result of the increasing
<em>Sh&#299;&#703;a</em> influence. In the ninth century and at the
beginnings of the tenth century, the prominent philosopher Ab&#363;
Y&#363;suf Ya&#703;q&#363;b b. Ish&#257;q al-Kind&#299; (d. ca.
870) had already developed single philosophical doctrines (e.g. in
cosmology or psychology; an examination of the contents of Epistle 41
<em>On definition and descriptions</em> in the light of
al-Kind&#299;&rsquo;s treatise with the same title is made by
Poonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 277 ff.). Though elaborating
them in an original way, al-Kind&#299; had not tried to combine such
doctrines with the basics of Muslim faith. Theological considerations
remain parallel with philosophical issues. The physician Muhammad ibn
Zakariyy&#257;&rsquo; al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. ca. 925), mainly
interested to natural philosophy, had even questioned the legitimacy
of prophecy.</p>

<p>
At the time of al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 950), ancient knowledge
will be considered as an organic whole &ndash; not only a sum of
theoretical elaborations, but as a real encyclopedia of sciences. It
should provide at every level, from the most elementary to the most
complex, the necessary premises for the acquisition of ultimate
knowledge &ndash; the knowledge of God. Then, authentically Muslim
thought &ndash; religious in the strict sense &ndash; begins with the
substitution of the schemes of Greek philosophy for those of the
Sacred Text. This is what I. Netton (1989) defined as &ldquo;the
progressive estrangement from the Qur&rsquo;anic Creator
Paradigm.&rdquo; Ancient knowledge is the basis on which the patrimony
of faith is built: sciences are significant not merely in themselves
so much as a partial reflection of the single and unique divine Being.
See Heck (2008, 2002) for interesting articles that focus on both the
Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s and al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s
&ldquo;willingness to turn to philosophy to explain religion and trace
its boundaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The sense of truly &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; science is largely a product
of the ideological commitment of the authors. Consequently, scholars
arrived to consider the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; as
representatives of a &ldquo;humanistic approach&rdquo; to Islam (e.g.,
Albert Reyna 2007). This view, however, is challenged by their
attitude, to see the ultimate goal of their gnosiological experience
as an attempt of separating the soul from the ties of matter and
purifying it to achieve happiness in the hereafter (see also Reymond
2012, 126; Raymond 2014, 150). For them, purification can be reached
by following prophetic revelation with the help of reason. Certainly,
the study of ancient sciences is not viewed, as by &ldquo;orthodox
theologians&rdquo;, as a vehicle of heresy and even atheism. Rather,
sciences explain the underlying reality of the universe and so allow
rational understanding of the contents of Revelation and of religious
Law. As Reymond (2012, 143) puts it, the Brethren&rsquo;s intellectual
attitude demonstrates &ldquo;une mentalit&eacute; en
construction,&rdquo; announcing &ldquo;une avanc&eacute;e dans une
mentalit&eacute; forg&eacute;e par le <em>terminus ad quem</em>
pr&eacute;visible d&rsquo;une autorit&eacute; du dogme achronique et
ind&eacute;passable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The blending of scientific and religious issues is evident from the
beginning in the encyclopedia. Sciences should be the main topic in
the first and the second sections and, partially, in the third, and
theology in the rest of the <em>corpus</em>. In spite of the fact that
ancient texts are always quoted with great accuracy from a
philological point of view, the Ikhw&#257;n deeply rework the Greek
sources in line with their goals that are completely different from
those of the ancients. Thus religion should not be underestimated in
order to attain the best comprehension of its various contents and
real aims.</p>

<h2 id="ClaHer">5. The classical heritage</h2>

<p>
Let us approach the first feature of the encyclopedia, that is, its
reworking the of foreign &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; contents. Various
cultural elements come together in the Epistles: Babylonian, Indian
and Iranian astrology, Indian and Persian narrative, biblical
quotations and cabbalistic influences, references to the New Testament
and Christian gnosis. A good survey of these contents can be found in
Netton 1991, 53 ff., 89 ff. More recently, the scholar has emphasized
as &ldquo;Philosophically, the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> [...]
constitute a marvelous epitome of the mixing of Aristotelianism and
Neoplatonism in the caldron of Islamic intellectual endeavour&rdquo;
(Netton 2009, 109). In spite of the commixtion of Aristotelian and
Neoplatonic ideas &ndash; e.g., for identifying Aristotle&rsquo;s
active cause with the faculties of the Universal Soul,
&ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s terminology is all-pervasive in the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>&rdquo; (ibid., 111&ndash;112). Most
attention is paid to the Greeks, from the so-called
&ldquo;pre-socratics&rdquo; to Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and the
Stoics. The encyclopedia can thus be considered a <em>compendium</em>
of foreign sciences, deserving attention even by those who are only
interested to ascertain the extent of what the Arabs knew of ancient
doctrines at that time.</p>

<p>
Comparisons between the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s quotations and the extant
Arabic versions of classical works often show that they might have
used the same translations at our disposal now. When such comparisons
are not possible, the ancient <em>excerpta</em> usually correspond to
the extant original texts. We should conclude, then, that in quoting,
reporting &ndash; and, perhaps, translating &ndash; ancient sources
the Ikhw&#257;n display the same philological and philosophical
expertise associated with the scholars to whom we owe the flourishing
of the translation movement in Baghd&#257;d. In some cases, they have
even preserved the only Arabic fragments of Greek authors known to us,
as exemplified by the well-known case of the story of Giges from
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> in Epistle 52. (The story of Giges is
analyzed in Baffioni 2001, 168&ndash;170, 175&ndash;178). Platonic
references in the encyclopedia are also scarce. The majority of them
are found in the fourth section and concern the trial and death of
Socrates. The Ikhw&#257;n are also informed about the Platonic view
on pleasures and about Plato&rsquo;s conception of the soul as
consisting of three distinct parts: the rational soul, which resides
in the head; the irascible soul, which resides in the heart and is the
seat of courage; and the appetitive soul, the seat of desire, which
resides in the abdomen (III, 68, 4&ndash;6). The Platonic references
are religiously rather than philosophically oriented. That can perhaps
be explained by the influence of the Hellenistic <em>curricula
scientiarum</em> (courses of study) designed for philosophers. These
began by a reflection on the Stoic <em>bios theoretik&ograve;s</em>
(the philosophical attitude towards life), continued with Aristotelian
works representing the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; side of knowledge, and
ended with Platonic writings, representing the
&ldquo;theological&rdquo; knowledge (D&rsquo;Ancona Costa 1996,
30&ndash;31). The religious approach to ancient heritage leads the
Ikhw&#257;n to consider philosophy as an &ldquo;imitation of God
according to human capacity.&rdquo; This definition immediately
clarifies Hellenism as the authors&rsquo; first theoretical and
historical reference. Their source is here Plato or, rather, his
Hellenistic reading (Kraus 1986, 99, note 4).</p>

<p>
Although the Ikhw&#257;n appear widely Aristotelian (for instance,
for their presentation of the terrestrial world or the theory of
knowledge rooted in sensation), the wealth of the available sources
led the &ldquo;Pure Brethren&rdquo; to support their doctrines by a
variety of theoretical models, often melted together (which even
affects the consistence of the Ikhwanian idea of God, Islamic and
Neoplatonic at the same time, Netton 2009, 108).</p>

<p>
The first topic addressed in the first section are the so-called
&ldquo;quadrivium&rdquo; (a Latin term meaning &ldquo;the four
ways&rdquo;) sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music):
Epistle 1 deals with arithmetic, Epistle 2 with geometry, Epistle 3
with astronomy and Epistle 5 with music. Arithmetic, geometry and
music are later approached together in Epistle 6 <em>On
proportions</em>. Between these two treatises another one is added,
Epistle 4 <em>On geography</em>: <em>&#703;ilm al-hay&rsquo;a</em>
(literally &ldquo;cosmography&rdquo;) was evidently considered part of
astronomy &ndash; but Epistles 4 and 5 are copied in an inverted order
in some MSS.</p>

<p>
References for the various sciences are, generally identifiable:
Euclid, Nicomachus and sometimes even Archimedes for mathematical
tenets (Epistles 1, 2 and 6); Ptolemy supports astronomy and geography
(Epistles 3 and 4); the Pythagoreans and again Nicomachus are the
sources for musical theory (Epistles 5 and 6). The Greeks already saw
arithmetic and geometry as the necessary, though not unique, means of
attaining philosophical knowledge.</p>

<p>
Much of this section is devoted to logic, the &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;
of sciences according to Aristotle and a view widely shared by Muslims
(see Epistles 10&ndash;14). These treatises take the place of grammar,
logic and rhetoric, that in Middle Ages constituted the
&ldquo;trivium&rdquo; (in Latin: &ldquo;the three ways&rdquo;)
sciences and were the basis of a &ldquo;liberal arts&rdquo; education.
There is no place for poetry or for rhetorical devices in the
encyclopedia. Dialectics increases damaging opposition among the
learned. Although the Ikhw&#257;n appear interested in spoken
language and even in phonetics, they never approach grammar as a
science. Rather, they examine the technique of the
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; form of language &ndash; logic. In the
well-known 10th century debate on the superiority of grammar or of
logic, they might have sided with the Christian logician Ab&#363;
Bishr Matt&#257; ibn Y&#363;nus more than with the grammarian
Ab&#363; Sa&#703;&#299;d al-Siraf&#299; (cf. Heck 2008, 11 for a
new perspective on this issue). &ldquo;Trivium&rdquo; was considered
preparatory for the &ldquo;quadrivium,&rdquo; which was in turn
considered preparatory for the study of philosophy and theology. The
&ldquo;trivium&rdquo; and &ldquo;quadrivium&rdquo; sciences are
described in the encyclopedia in an original way as distinct from that
of other Muslim writers as well as the Latin west (de Callata&yuml;
2005, 61&ndash;62). Hellenistic influence is remarkable even when the
Ikhw&#257;n rely on Aristotelian logic. The logical treatises include
paraphrases of Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoges</em>, which the later
Greeks considered to be the first book of <em>Organon</em>
(<em>Rhetoric</em> and <em>Poetics</em> were taken to be its last
books). It is followed by Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>,
<em>De interpretatione</em>, <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>.</p>

<p>
This choice of texts shows that the Ikhw&#257;n conform to the
&ldquo;old&rdquo; tradition that restricted research to the first
Books of the <em>Organon</em>, not to that of their great contemporary
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, who expanded it to the whole logical
<em>corpus</em>. This might be due to the religious aims of the
encyclopedia. Religious matters can only be treated by relying on the
sound (<em>sah&#299;h</em>) method for knowledge, while procedures
aiming at mere persuasion or linked to the attainment of that which is
useful (and not true) are not to be employed. Logic is no longer a
simple instrument of science as it was for Aristotle, but a true
science, perhaps the most important one. The Brethren call it
&ldquo;the scale of sciences&rdquo; through which the wise men are
able to discern &ldquo;true from false in speeches, right from wrong
in opinions, truth from vanity in beliefs and good from evil in
acts&rdquo; (cf., e.g., Epistle 7, I, 268, 14&ndash;16).</p>

<p>
Epistle 7 <em>On the theoretical arts</em> carefully sketches the
Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s epistemological vision. A sort of
&ldquo;table&rdquo; of human sciences is given (I, 266, 14&ndash;274,
21). There are three kinds of sciences in hierarchical progression:
the &ldquo;propaedeutical&rdquo; (or preparatory,
<em>al-riy&#257;diyya</em> again; &ldquo;a designation not absolutely
unambiguous&rdquo; according to de Callata&yuml; in El-Bizri; de
Callata&yuml; 2017, 78 ff.), those imposed by religious Law
(<em>al-shar&#703;iyya al-wad&#703;iyya</em>) and the
&ldquo;philosophical sciences allowing the full comprehension of
truth&rdquo; (<em>al-falsafiyya al-haq&#299;qiyya</em>, higher than
the religious sciences). The sciences listed first in the table are
labelled &ldquo;propaedeutical&rdquo; just as the
&ldquo;trivium&rdquo; and &ldquo;quadrivium&rdquo; sciences of the
encyclopedia, but here the term is used in a totally different sense.
It concerns matters of practical utility, such as reading and writing,
grammar and poetry (someway close to the &ldquo;trivium&rdquo;
sciences), but also magic, mechanics, arts, trades, history and so on.
Although the Ikhw&#257;n state that the sciences of the third group
&ndash; the &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; in the higher sense of the
word &ndash; are the object of their Epistles, they do not coincide
exactly with the contents of the encyclopedia, at least, with those of
the <em>corpus</em> now available. So, the table can be considered as
evidence of the fact that the whole encyclopedia has been produced
during a very long period of time. On the one hand, it might have been
retained as a first draft of the future enterprise; on the other, it
shows the further elaborations of the <em>corpus</em> over the
centuries.</p>

<p>
Epistles 7 and 8 explicitly recall the Aristotelian division of the
theoretical and practical sciences. Epistle 7 is extensively based on
Aristotle (when the Ikhw&#257;n introduce the nine
&ldquo;philosophical questions,&rdquo; they are thinking of the
Aristotelian categories, cf. I, 262, 14&ndash;266, 7; Epistle 29, III,
35, 6&ndash;7; Epistle 40, III, 345, 6&ndash;346, 6; Epistle 42, III,
513, 14&ndash;16 and 514, 13&ndash;516, 5). However, the ultimate goal
of the scientific investigation is identified with the path towards
hereafter and even connected to asceticism where scientists and
prophets follow the same way: Aristotelian science is linked to the
Isma&#703;ili teaching (<em>ta&#703;l&#299;m</em>, cf. I, 274,
20&ndash;275, 4). The &ldquo;programmatic&rdquo; aim of Epistle 7
leads us to consider it as the ideal introduction to the whole
<em>corpus</em>.</p>

<p>
A different type of source can be found in de Callata&yuml; 2020,
which discusses the tenfold classification of the sciences contained
in <em>Gh&#257;yat al-hak&#299;m</em>. Five of these disciplines are
said to be compulsory &ldquo;for the legislators,&rdquo; while the
other five are said to be compulsory &ldquo;for the
philosopher.&rdquo; Hellmut Ritter and Martin Plessner defined this
theory as &ldquo;ein Unikum in der umfangreichen
Einteilungsliteratur&rdquo;. Now de Callata&yuml; compares a rich
collection of texts containing a similar classification. He concludes
that Middle Persian literature is a more plausible formative influence
on the conception of tenfold classifications of knowledge than Greek
literature. In this regard, I would like to draw attention to the
article by Agostini and Thrope 2020. Here, the epistles are compared
with the <em>Bundahishn</em>, one of the most important Zoroastrian
texts redacted in the 9th century. The interpretation of the
encyclopedia naturally aligns with the nature and cultural origins of
the <em>Bundahishn</em>.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the authors&rsquo; Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;
commitment is proven by the fact that in the complementary treatise
<em>On the practical arts</em> the ancient &ldquo;banausic&rdquo;
(utilitarian) activities are dealt with which were held in high esteem
in Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism (cf. Lewis 1943; Marquet 1961; and,
more recently, Yasien 2006 and Daftary 2007, 115).</p>

<p>
Although the content of the first section is the most
&ldquo;uniform,&rdquo; inconsistencies are found already in it. This
is especially clear in Epistle 9, which portrays the &ldquo;ideal wise
man&rdquo; from the standpoint of the encyclopedia, where moral
edification is never separated from theoretical teaching. The approach
is more than an echo of the well known Aristotelian division of
philosophy: it stems from the view of the Ikhw&#257;n that he who
searches for true wisdom must be endowed with a true mind as well as a
pure heart. Epistle 9 breaks the series of the scientific treatises.
Various moral behaviours are considered, with the support of a long
series of anecdotes about prophets and wise men, which provide textual
evidence that the Ikhw&#257;n may in practice have found asceticism
(Sufism?) as another way of attaining or &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo;
purification (cf. Epistles 6, 16 and 24). The recent critical edition
with English translation and commentary by Al&iacute;-de-Unzaga (2024)
illustrates in detail the epistle in its relationship with the corpus
and with respect to the Qur&rsquo;&#257;n and Prophetic Tradition,
Greek sources, Arabic <em>adab</em> literature, scientific literature,
and Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; literature.</p>

<p>
The composed and eclectic character of the whole is even more evident
in the three other sections. In the second section, the Epistles
15&ndash;22 follow the Hellenistic arrangement of Aristotle&rsquo;s
works on physics. Epistle 15 echoes the themes addressed in the
<em>Physics</em>. In Epistle 16, entitled, <em>On the heaven and the
world</em>, the Ikhw&#257;n are shown to be in line with the Muslim
tradition which transformed the ancient <em>De caelo</em> into a new
book <em>De caelo et mundo</em>. Epistle 17 deals with <em>De
generatione and corruptione</em>. Epistle 18 about meteorological
phenomena and Epistle 19 about minerals recall the contents of
<em>Meteorology</em> I&ndash;III and IV respectively. <em>Meteor.</em> IV,
sometimes considered spurious and &ldquo;the first chemical work in
ancient world&rdquo; according to scholars, was the basis of the
theories of &ldquo;chemical&rdquo; or &ldquo;alchemical&rdquo;
transformations in Islamic sciences and of mineralogy. The Ikhwanian
treatise deals with mineralogy, geology and gemmology and in the
correspondence established between the celestial and sub-lunar worlds,
between the stars and minerals, it expresses one of the main tenets of
alchemy. Further Aristotelian echoes are found in Epistle 24 <em>On
sense and sensation</em>, to which Epistle 35 <em>On intellect and
intelligible</em> corresponds in the third section. After topics
concerning nature, such as the human body in Epistle 23, conception in
Epistle 25, and man as microcosm in Epistle 26 [on the relationship
between micro- an macrocosm see Maukola, 2009 and, in quite a new
perspective, Nokso-Koivisto, 2011) the most important topic for the
Ikhw&#257;n, the human spiritual dimension is addressed. It is
discussed in terms of the relationship between soul and body in
Epistles 27 e 28, life and death in Epistle 29, and pleasures in
Epistle 30. The Aristotelian theory of the immovable mover, which is
introduced in Epistle 37 <em>On love</em>, to explain the movement
imparted to stars by the heavenly Universal Soul accomplishes its
religious meaning. It serves to confirm the love human beings feel for
permanence and their hatred for death: God is the most beloved as the
everlasting cause of all beings.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, natural treatises reflect the availability of the
rich range of mineralogical, botanical and agricultural works, but
none of the works by Aristotle on minerals or plants were known to the
Arabs. The <em>corpus</em> <em>aristotelicum</em> on animals reached
them (apart from the <em>De partibus</em> and the <em>De generatione
animalium</em>) in an abridged form under the title of <em>Kit&#257;b
al-hayaw&#257;n</em>, but Epistle 22 <em>On animals</em> is quite far
in its content and goals from the Aristotelian <em>corpus</em>. In
fact, it places the whole matter within the well-known metaphysical
dispute on the superiority of man on animals (besides some attempts of
viewing it even in an &ldquo;ecological perspective&rdquo;; see Darraz
2012; Raymond 2014, 151).</p>

<p>
In more recent years, the <em>Epistle on Animals</em> has attracted
the attention of numerous scholars. In particular, the so-called
&ldquo;prologue&rdquo; to the epistle has been the subject of study.
This text contains an esoteric interpretation and is, at least in
part, consistent with the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; tendencies
of the Ikhw&#257;n. This is the view of de Callata&yuml; (2018).
However, various themes such as a) God&rsquo;s Intimates, b)
Seventy/Seventy-Two, c) Seven, d) Ya&#703;s&#363;b (the Commander of
the Bees, and a nickname of &#703;Al&#299; ibn Ab&#299;
T&#257;lib), e) the Return of the Conjunction, and f) the function of
the equator in the text reveal numerous elements of various origins.
These confirm the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s syncretism more than anything
else. De Callata&yuml; (2022) also focuses on the prologue to the
<em>Epistle on Animals</em>. Although this text is similar in length
to some of the epistles in the encyclopedia and is undoubtedly deeply
influenced by Aristotelian thought on animals, it cannot be fully
understood without recognising the influence of the Pythagoreans and
Neoplatonic thought. The prologue also highlights the importance of
the &ldquo;perfect man&rdquo;, the syncretic man that the Brethren
introduce at the end of the Epistle and is the incarnation of the
noble angel in potentiality that they mention at the beginning of the
treatise. This establishes the unity and coherence of the entire
treatise, providing a foundation for the ancient principle that the
humans&rsquo; condition is hellish as long as the soul is incapable to
move to the angelic rank. Pythagorean influences are evident in the
idea that certain animals are perfectly constituted because their
natures combine the nine arithmetical units. Considering the
remarkable numbers found in the human body, such as the twelve
orifices, twenty-eight vertebrae, and three hundred and sixty veins,
the Ikhw&#257;n conclude that existing beings follow the nature of
numbers. Animals and humans are also correlated with astral cycles of
varying lengths. Particular attention is paid to the passage stating
that, at the end of each 7,000-year cycle the souls of the beasts
(<em>bah&#257;&#702;im</em>) are enabled to get freed from their
condition, because they are, of all animals, those that are the most
badly treated. The transformation of their animal souls into human
souls would be a compensation for their former miserable condition.
This statement opens up the possibility that the Ikhw&#257;n believed
in metempsychosis.</p>

<p>
Emphasis had already been given to the transmigration and survival of
the soul by Stern 1964, 421. In recent years, Lory 2018 has already
touched upon the topic, when he examines the conception of the human
being in <em>adab</em> and <em>falsafa</em> with J&#257;hiz (d. 867),
Ibn Miskawayh (d. 1030) and the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;.
Once again, the central idea is that humanity is only fulfilled in its
higher state, that of the sage or prophet. Holiness is the only
differential attribute of humans with respect to animals.
Metempsychosis is also addressed in Almutawa 2018. The author claims
that the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; were intentionally
inconsistent in their views on bodily resurrection and the afterlife:
they accepted the resurrection of the body, but rejected it within the
same section of their treatise on resurrection for pedagogical
reasons. Assuming that the physical is inferior to the spiritual, and
that the material world causes suffering whereas the spiritual world
contains bliss, heaven cannot be a physical place; but hell is
certainly the soul&rsquo;s embodiment. This thesis demonstrates that
the Ikhw&#257;n developed an original method of Qur&rsquo;anic
interpretation for their time (although it was typical of the
12th/14th centuries). It combined the Neoplatonic (scientific) view
with the Qur&rsquo;anic view. The Ikhw&#257;n accept the idea of
metempsychosis (<em>tan&#257;sukh</em>), found in Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy and the Arabic adaptation of Plotinus&rsquo;s
<em>Enneads</em>. In conclusion, the Ikhw&#257;n believe in the
eternity of the soul, but not of the body. Mattila 2019 agrees with
the idea that the Ikhw&#257;n believed in metempsychosis. The
importance of this line of research is remarkable given that, despite
the fact that Pythagoreanism is one of their doctrinal foundations,
the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; can only openly deny the
doctrine of the transmigration of souls (as is the case, for example,
in Epistle 42, III, 424, 15). Chowdhury 2021 returned to the
importance of animal allegory itself.</p>

<p>
De Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s most recent publications have also
focused on the <em>Epistle on Animals</em>. His researches culminated
in a monograph containing a new French translation of the treatise
alongside a broad historical and theoretical framework. The aim is of
restoring the treatise to its original context, disregarding
interpretations that, since Dieterici, have linked it to modern
theories (Darwinism, ecology, etc.) (de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy, 2021). In
de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy 2020, the rhinoceros being classified as a bird
shows that the <em>Epistle on Animals</em> marks a paradigm shift that
would be finalised by the physician Ibn Ab&#299; al-Ash&#703;ath in
the mid-10th century. This shift involves replacing an
&ldquo;eco-biological&rdquo; criterion with an anthropological one.
This is in accordance with the idea that humans are the organising
principle of the animal world. One topic arising from the <em>Epistle
on Animals</em> is the domestication of animals by humans
(<em>al-taskh&#299;r</em>), which is examined in de Vaulx
d&rsquo;Arcy 2021&ndash;22 in relation to its influence on later
thinkers. This doctrine emerged in the 3rd/9th century, a period
pivotal in the development of Islamic sciences, and the era in which
de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy dates the epistles, ascribing them to
al-Sarakhs&#299;.</p>

<p>
The influence of the <em>Epistle on Animals</em> on the contemporary
world is evident in the latest work by the anthropologist and thinker
Jos&eacute; Antonio J&aacute;uregui (1941&ndash;2005), the
children&rsquo;s story <em>Juicio a los humanos</em> (edited by his
son Eduardo J&aacute;uregui, RBA Bolsillo 2009). In an imaginary
forest, animals gather to judge humans, accused of heinous crimes. An
owl acts as judge, a cobra as prosecutor and a dog as defence lawyer,
among other characters. It is a profound analysis of our society and
the contemporary world (Villanueva-Romero 2020).</p>

<p>
The authors&rsquo; view of embryology (Epistle 25) is also a
collection from different sources. On the one hand, the Ikhw&#257;n
were not physicians, though they display extensive knowledge of
anatomy and share the Aristotelian thesis of the origin of the embryo
from the sperm and menstrual blood, while they did not accept the
ancient Hippocratic theory as developed by Galen, of a female sperm
coexisting with that of the male in the formation of the human being.
On the other hand, they emphasize an astronomical/astrological
approach to embryology that was not in Greek sources. It is considered
to be a new idea introduced by Islamic scientists, from whom it passed
into the Latin world. Greek sources for Epistle 37 on love also
vary.</p>

<p>
The real deviation from Aristotelianism is Epistle 20 <em>On
nature</em>. In that it shows how nature as taught by Aristotle was
received and theorized by the authors, this treatise could serve as
the perfect introduction to the section on natural sciences. However,
its main part regards angelology. It also introduces a Neoplatonically
inspired conception of Nature, suggestive of
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; philosophical positions, as Ab&#363;
Ya&#703;q&#363;b al-Sijist&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s representation of
Nature as &ldquo;agent power&rdquo; and &ldquo;principle of
movement&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Though the Ikhw&#257;n never mention Plotinus explicitly, the third
section opens with two treatises that deal with rational beings as
understood by the Pythagoreans (Epistle 32) and the Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; (Epistle 33). These treatises demonstrate beyond
doubt that these authors considered themselves true Muslim
Pythagoreans. Pythagoras is said to be &ldquo;a monotheist from
Harr&#257;n.&rdquo; The Pythagorean idea of the one as the principle
of numbers, and not as a number itself explains that God is the origin
of beings, and not a being like others. If God is like the one, the
Active Intellect is compared to number 2, the Universal Soul to number
3 and Nature (or Matter) to number 4 (cf. e.g. Epistle 40, III, 347,
5). The encyclopedia resumes Pythagorean mathematical and musical
theories and adopts a numerological approach on the basis of the
Pythagorean tenet that &ldquo;existing beings correspond to the nature
of number.&rdquo; The whole reality is considered under a
numerological perspective. Every aspect of nature &ndash; and even of
religion &ndash; follows a numeric pattern. De Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy
2019a gives the French translations of Epistles 1 On Arithmetic, 2 On
Geometry, 6 On Arithmetic, Geometric, and Harmonic Proportions, 29 On
the Wisdom of Death and Life, 33 On the Intellectual Principles
according to the Brethren of Purity, and 50 On the Species of
Governance. The A. states that &ldquo;Justement, le g&eacute;nie des
&Eacute;p&#299;tres consiste, selon nous, &agrave; avoir su explorer
comment les math&eacute;matiques nous aident &agrave; r&eacute;soudre
des probl&egrave;mes philosophiques&rdquo; (2019, 82). He also alludes
to the distinction made by the Ikhw&#257;n between themselves and the
Pythagoreans, whose doctrine is described in Epistle 32. He claims
that the Pythagoreans are not just an ancient school, but an active
one. This is indicated by two elements. Firstly, the philosophical
doctrine attributed to the Pythagoreans cannot be reduced to any known
Hellenistic form. Secondly, the biographical elements of Pythagoras
are transposed into the unique geographical setting of the city of
Harr&#257;n. Therefore, it can be presupposed that among the Sabians
of Harr&#257;n there are thinkers who can be identified with
Pythagoreanism. De Vaulx&rsquo;s strong theoretical approach seems to
draw a parallel between various ontologies based on a set of
principles and number sequences. He also seems to attribute to the
Ikhw&#257;n the idea that such ontologies progressively approach the
truth of monotheism. &ldquo;Elle est une m&eacute;ta-ontologie, qui
&laquo; rend &agrave; chacun ce qui lui est d&#363; &raquo;,
c&rsquo;est-&agrave;-dire qui ne se crispe pas sur une ontologie
particuli&egrave;re associ&eacute;e &agrave; un nombre de principes
(le dualisme des Zoroastriens, la trinit&eacute; des
Chr&eacute;tiens,&hellip;), mais leur donne &agrave; chacune un rang
dans la suite des entiers naturels. La v&eacute;rit&eacute; est la
suite ordonn&eacute;e des v&eacute;rit&eacute;s&rdquo; (2019,
324&ndash;325). The Ikhw&#257;n follow the Pythagoreans because the
Pythagorean school pays tribute to the divine organisation of the
world and aims to discover musical harmony, both instrumental and
cosmic.</p>

<p>
The fact that every aspect of nature follows a numerical pattern
should demonstrate that the cosmos &ndash; also introduced as a
&ldquo;macranthropos&rdquo; (man as the pattern of the external world
as a whole) in Epistle 34 &ndash; is organized according to recurrent
and well-determined quantitative models, being at the same time
completely dependent on God, the principle of everything just as one
is the root of each number. According to de Callata&yuml;,
Aristotelian themes are &ldquo;reshaped&rdquo;, for didactic purposes,
in a Neoplatonic frame (El-Bizri; de Callata&yuml; 2017, 88), so that
those who organized the corpus in its final version &ldquo;are
definitely to be ranged amongst hard-line Neoplatonists in medieval
Islam&rdquo; (El-Bizri; de Callata&yuml; 2017, 89). An indirect
influence of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s mathematical terminology is
evident in Abraham Ibn Ezra&rsquo;s commentary on Qohelet 7:27
(Robinson 2021, 290 ff.).</p>

<p>
Among the other philosophical schools and doctrines quoted in the
encyclopedia an important role is played by hermetism (the religion of
the philosophical elite in Ancient Egypt, founded by Hermes
Trismegistus), as in Epistle 3 <em>On astronomy</em> and, more
broadly, in Epistle 52 (Marquet 1973, 1988). Ancient theories on the
movements of the stars will finally evolve in Epistle 36 into that
which, following Cumont, G. de Callata&yuml; (1996, 36&ndash;37) has
defined as a &ldquo;fatalisme astral.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="RelCom">6. The religious component</h2>

<p>
Just like philosophy, as a way towards salvation, is an imitation of
God and implies that the disciple is provided not only of an acute
mind, but also of a pure heart (through which God will be recognized
as the sole and the supreme teacher in knowledge and deeds, as the
Holy Book demonstrates, cf., e.g., Qur., II, 31: &lsquo;And He taught
Adam the names&rsquo;, mentioned in Epistle 28, III, 18, 14&ndash;16
and in Epistle 31, III, 112, 19 and 141, 13&ndash;14; cf. also Epistle
23, II, 381, 17), the Ikhw&#257;n consider prophetic message (both
esoteric and exoteric, hidden and clear) as the second necessary means
for human salvation and happiness. This brings us back to the second
aspect of the encyclopedia, its religious commitment.</p>

<p>
We already saw that the Ikhw&#257;n rework the classical heritage in
religious terms. They also deal with doctrinal questions linked to
religion. Epistle 42 <em>On opinions and religions,</em> the other
&ldquo;programmatic&rdquo; treatise of the encyclopedia that opens the
fourth section, is a discussion of the basic ideas of the Brotherhood
such as the multifaceted epistemological problems, the origin of the
world, morals and theodicy and the imamate as well as the various
doctrines critically considered by the Ikhw&#257;n, such as
eternalism and dualism. It also develops the apologetic side of
Ikhwanian thought.</p>

<p>
Epistle 40 <em>On causes and effects</em> addresses the crucial
problem of the origin of the world. The Ikhw&#257;n subvert to
religious purposes Aristotle&rsquo;s teleological approach that
&ldquo;nature does not make anything in vain.&rdquo; Understanding
creation, one of the basic Muslim tenets, is recognized as the highest
attainment of knowledge. So, the ancients are defended from the charge
of eternalism (cf. III, 356, 11&ndash;18) and, for the sake of the
masses, creation is even explained through the comparison of God with
a confectioner. However the Ikhw&#257;n &ndash; like the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis &ndash; adopt Neoplatonic views as the
best explication of the origin of the world by God. The world, then,
emanates from God through the hypostases of Intellect and Soul.
Emanationism is the philosophical expression of creation. This
doctrine also explains the encyclopaedic structure of the
treatises. The various levels of reality down to the three kingdoms of
the generated beings (animal, vegetable and mineral) originate
continuously through intermediaries from the One. For this reason, by
acquiring all the sciences from the lowest to the highest it is
possible to attain the common source of everything, the &lsquo;science
of God&rsquo; in the double sense of pertaining to God and concerning
God &ndash; the ancient metaphysics (<em>met&agrave; ta
physik&agrave;)</em> no longer indicates what comes
&ldquo;after&rdquo; physics but what is &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; it. Thus,
rather than a mere foreign source, Neoplatonism (merged with
Neopythagorism) can be considered as the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s proper
philosophy. Philosophy as imitation of God continues as the guiding
principle of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s system, together with equal
emphasis on divine revelation.</p>

<p>
From Epistle 43 onwards, the Ikhw&#257;n build their own system from
a religious point of view, often in the fragmentary style typical of
Muslim esoteric writings. Epistle 43 considers the way towards God
through purification; then the beliefs of the Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; and of the so-called &ldquo;Divines,&rdquo; the
heirs of a prophetic tradition whose origin is ascribed to the ancient
wise men (Epistle 44). Epistle 45 expounds the organization of the
Brotherhood based on mutual help. Epistle 46 considers the faith, not
only of Islam, but also of the former monotheistic religions and of
the ancient wise men. Epistle 47 considers prophecy and the imamate.
Epistle 48 discusses propaganda. Epistle 49 deals with a key theme in
the encyclopedia &ndash; the existence of disembodied agents in the
world, based on the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s idea that the full truth of
the Qur&rsquo;&#257;n, obscured in their time by ignorance and
distortions, could only be restored thanks to the study of the
rational sciences developed by the Greek philosophers. In the
surviving manuscript tradition, Epistle 49 appears in two versions, a
short and a long one. The short one clearly preserves an older text.
The long one contains a detailed elaboration of part of the short one.
The short version also consists of two parts; the second is a
commentary on the Epistle by an author other than that of the first,
namely Maslama al-Qurtub&#299; al-Majr&#299;&#7789;&#299;, during
his stay at Basra in 936&ndash;7. At the same time, Maslama should
have also composed what de Callata&yuml; identified as the
&ldquo;short version&rdquo; of <em>Epistle on Magic</em>, to which
Epistle 49 was to be an introduction. In fact, both treatises aim to
prove the existence of spiritual beings: magic in all its forms
consists precisely in the acts of such spiritual beings. The long
version would have been composed by Maslama after his return to
Cordoba. In the printed editions, the final part of the short version
is added to the text of the long version, but the addition is not
found in any of the MSS examined in the new edition, while it might be
found in the MS on which the first printed edition was based (that of
Bombay, 1887&ndash;1889); but we do not know if such MS still exists
(Madelung et al. 2019, 1&ndash;3). Epistle 49 is a complex exposition
of Ikhwanian cosmology, remarkably different and richer than that
exposed in any other epistle. This exposition is merged with the
authors&rsquo; religious vision on the relationship between God and
the world (Uy in Madelung et al. 2019, 8). A new vision of the
Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s magic as the &ldquo;conceptual and practical
pivot&rdquo; of their religious-political reform based on inclusion
and tolerance is in Saif 2019; a study of the so-called &ldquo;longer
version&rdquo; of Epistle 52 in Saif 2020. Epistle 50 discusses the
various kinds of &lsquo;administration&rsquo; (physical, spiritual,
personal, familiar, etc.), the core of the Epistle being the religious
and philosophical approach to God. In the new edition, the treatise
appears purged of all the passages that led Corbin to his esoteric
interpretation (Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, 148). Some MSS
provide additions and/or versions radically different from those
reported in the other consulted manuscripts and in the printed
versions available (Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, Appendices
A&ndash;D, 237&ndash;364; with regard to additions to other epistles
see Baffioni 2019a, 2019b). Noteworthy is the addition in MS Esad
Efendi 3638 that explains the story of Adam meant as the progenitor of
humankind, the first speaking prophet and the heavenly
<em>im&#257;m</em> (ed. and tr. by Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019,
237&ndash;277; cf. also Baffioni 2020b). Apparently, Epistle 51 duly
gathers up the threads of the whole (often repeating contexts of
previous treatises), but its recent editor has also ascertained the
existence of two versions of it, maybe even three (Alshaar in Madelung
et al. 2019, 381ff.). Epistle 52 <em>On magic</em> is the last in the
<em>corpus</em>, missing in some editions and considered by some
scholars (Bausani 1978, 12 and 279) as spurious, and of little value,
so the <em>Ris&#257;la al-J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> would be the true
fifty-second one (cf. de Callata&yuml; 2011, 3). However, de
Callata&yuml; inclines to the view that the &lsquo;short
version&rsquo; of this treatise, namely, the part approximately
corresponding to the first thirty pages of the Beirut edition, is
genuine (de Callata&yuml; 2011, 5ff).</p>

<p>
That a text exists in different versions is not an isolated case. Two
versions of Epistles 32 have been found by Walker (Walker et al. 2015,
5, 7&ndash;8). Similarly, there are two versions of Epistle 48; one is
based on a group of MSS that appear to have been copied from an
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; specimen; the other is based on a
second group of MSS, including Atif Efendi 1618. Despite the
permanence of Sh&#299;&#703;ite elements, Hamdani believes that the
material in the second version has been rearranged in order to provide
a version acceptable to Sunni-Sufi readers. Although one must believe
to the story handed down by al-Tawh&#299;d&#299;, there must have
been an earlier sh&#299;&#703;i version of the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019,
383).</p>

<p>
The existence of different versions of a same epistle raises questions
about the history of its transmission and about how such existence
should be interpreted. Which version should have priority? Should the
various versions be considered to be different stages or different
aspects of the same authorial project? On what basis should they be
assessed? The date of a MS, although of considerable importance for
determining its value, cannot be taken as the sole criterion for
deciding the authenticity or the greater antiquity of a textual
tradition, since a late MS may have been copied from a very ancient
one. Also, due to problems related to the transmission of MSS
themselves, to their dating, and to the nature of the various
epistles, it is difficult to decide which versions is older or more
authentic (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 382&ndash;383).</p>

<p>
The <em>corpus</em> addresses other main religious issues in Muslim
faith: the unity and uniqueness, and the attributes of God, angels,
human destiny, good and evil, resurrection. Divine will and power are
also considered when trying to explain evil in the world, though, of
course, Muslim faith does not allow identifying God as the cause of
evil (Epistle 19). Ultimately, the Ikhw&#257;n attribute it to human
responsibility, or, better, to the responsibility of creatures in
general and they do so in quite a Mu&#703;tazilite perspective. In
the hierarchical disposition of universe there are
&ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; beings to which everything that happens in
the world may be related. God, a quite remote &ldquo;first
beloved&rdquo; is beyond all this, like the kings, whose orders are
behind everything built during their reigns. Epistle 39 <em>On the
kinds of movement</em> considers the movement of the whole cosmos,
from that of the stars down to those (natural and voluntary) of human
beings. Its aim is to demonstrate the existence of a God who created
the world and who will bring it to an end. In Epistle 27 souls (that
are self-subsistent according to the ancient doctrine) unite
themselves to human bodies in order to ensure human salvation; hence
wise men and prophets are said to be the &ldquo;physicians of the
souls&rdquo; (III, 13, 7 ff.). The main religious topic is, however,
resurrection, thoroughly examined in Epistle 38 where it is also
considered as the supreme science (III, 288, 3&ndash;5). The theme was
already addressed in Epistle 29 (wisdom is recognizable in death in
that it allows the vision of God, hence the highest sorrow is
damnation). On the same line, Epistle 30 states that the real
&ldquo;Hell&rdquo; is earth, &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; is heaven.
However, the Ikhw&#257;n deem as &ldquo;providential&rdquo; the
ignorance of the beauties of the afterlife, which might urge people to
desire death before the natural end of life. In doing so, they are far
from the Pythagorean doctrine that considered the soul as a fallen
divinity imprisoned within the body as in a &ldquo;tomb&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In conclusion, whereas in <em>Ihs&#257;&rsquo;
al-&#703;ul&#363;m</em> (&ldquo;The Enumeration of the
Sciences&rdquo;), al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; deals with Muslim
sciences such as theology (<em>kal&#257;m</em>) and law
(<em>fiqh</em>), the Ikhw&#257;n mainly stress religion. In the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em>, the usual distinction between
philosophy/sciences (the rational or <em>&#703;aqliyya</em>
knowledge) and theology (the received or <em>naqliyya</em> knowledge),
or between reason and faith is not valid as both are combined.</p>

<p>
On the formal side, the religious commitment appears in the frequent
Qur&rsquo;anic quotations in support of ancient doctrines, sometimes
through interpretations that are not in line with the theological
ones. Above all, the Ikhw&#257;n appropriate the Muslim ideal of
attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter and indicate in
the treatises how to reach it. In physical terms it is by caring for
the body, which when healthy and balanced is the condition of the
purification of the soul. In metaphysical terms, the purified soul is
said to be capable of knowledge, so of being saved &ndash; even
though, like the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis, the Ikhw&#257;n deny
salvation as attainable through solely philosophy.</p>

<p>
Prophethood is an undeniable part of the theoretical experience
featured by the Ikhw&#257;n. Their political vision is linked to this
and implies that attainment of happiness is considered in political
terms, too, where it results in examination of what has to be
accomplished to be worthy of entering the entourage of the
<em>im&#257;m</em>. In Epistle 40 the science of the esoteric
interpretation of the Qur&rsquo;&#257;n (explaining its hidden
meaning) is emphasized as the highest divine gift (in doing this the
Ikhw&#257;n give an interpretation of Qur., III, 7 which precedes
that, much more well-known, given by Averroes two centuries later, cf.
III, 344, 10&ndash;345, 5).</p>

<p>
The second pivot of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s philosophy in addition to
creation is their discussion of the imamate. It has its first origin
in Epistle 31 <em>On the diversity of languages</em> (now considered
from the standpoint mentioned in the title by Albert Reyna 2009). Here
the Ikhw&#257;n show that religious creeds change as a result of
language transformations. More particularly, differences and contrasts
within the <em>umma</em> due to changes in the Arabic language are
linked to the debate regarding the identity of the Messenger&rsquo;s
deputy, which is the main cause of schism in Islam &ldquo;until their
time,&rdquo; the Ikhw&#257;n say (cf. Epistle 31, III, 153,
8&ndash;10 and 165, 8&ndash;12). While everybody agrees on the tasks
of the <em>im&#257;m</em>, there is a disagreement as to his
identity. This is because imamate is of two kinds: prophetic and
regal. Usually the tasks of the ruler are neatly distinguished from
those of the prophet, because governance is a mundane business and
prophecy is related to the life to come (III, 497, 5&ndash;6). On
occasion these qualities are combined in a single person, who is then
the delegated prophet and also the ruler (III, 495, 18&ndash;19).
While the Prophet Muhammad was both prophet and ruler of the Muslim
<em>umma</em>, so ensuring its best defence, his possible successors
did not always match him in nobility. Subsequently, prophecy and
governance are sometimes found in two different persons, one of whom
is the prophet delegated to that community and the other the person
who has been given power over them. They support one another (III,
495, 19&ndash;21). The real problem seems, then, to be the dignity of
the person appointed as the caliph, which alone is the condition of a
legitimate prophetical succession. The Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s specific
idea on the identity of such a person is not clear. In addition, there
is apparently no distinction between the prophet, the
<em>im&#257;m</em> or the ruler with regard to the required
qualities, as Epistle 47 <em>On the essence of divine Law</em>
demonstrates. The sole &ldquo;doctrinal&rdquo; solution offered in the
encyclopedia seems that a ruler with ascetic tendencies can
legitimately take the place of the <em>im&#257;m</em>.</p>

<p>
The political ideas of the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; have not
been extensively analyzed by scholars, except when they have been
considered as a political movement. (The Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s interest
in political issues is mainly emphasized by Eastern scholars who in
general incline towards the hypothesis of their being
[&ldquo;filo]-Isma&#703;ili.&rdquo; Cf. Hijab, 1982; Tamir, 1983,
89&ndash;108). In fact, the &ldquo;Pure Brethren&rdquo; are contrasted
with the &ldquo;philosophers,&rdquo; who were understood to have taken
an outsider position with regard to the political expectations of the
society in which they lived, as a consequence of their evaluation of
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> (cf. e.g. Kraemer 1987 and Stroumsa
2003). However, the Ikhw&#257;n do not fail to approach policy from a
theoretical standpoint and the philosophical doctrines developed in
their Epistles can be understood to be a functional element of their
political vision. In Epistle 48, a <em>mad&#299;na f&#257;dila</em>
(perfect city) is featured &ndash; less known but no less worthy than
that proposed by al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;. This time the
Ikhw&#257;n do not hide themselves behind the ancient Platonic
heritage: they openly adapt a Greek idea to a Muslim situation, and
various aspects of the &lsquo;Ismailism&rsquo; of the treatise have
been highlighted in Baffioni, 2014a.</p>

<p>
Were the Ikhw&#257;n Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis? This of course
opens the way to the second side of the argument &ndash; the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; commitment of the Ikhw&#257;n.</p>

<p>
The saying &ldquo;<em>d&#299;n</em> and <em>mulk</em> are
twins&rdquo; in reference to the prophet and the king empowered to
perform the functions of the <em>im&#257;m</em> in the sense preached
by the Ikhw&#257;n perfectly fits the Fatimid rulers. If this
hypothesis is tenable, the debated &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; mentioned
in Epistle 31 with reference to the misunderstandings due to the
diversity of languages might be understood as the Fatimid versions of
the divine Law. If the Ikhwanian &ldquo;Lawgiver&rdquo; is identified
with the historical incarnation of the Isma&#703;ili faith, that is,
with the Fatimid caliph, and if the &ldquo;perfect city&rdquo; is the
one ruled by these caliphs, then the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;
are his <em>du&#703;&#257;&rsquo;</em>. Epistle 48, with the mention
of the term <em>da&#703;wa</em> in the title, might further support
the hypothesis of a project of concrete militancy by the
Ikhw&#257;n.</p>

<p>
The Ikhw&#257;n appear as the learned people who have the task of
promoting propaganda (<em>da&#703;wa</em>). Sometimes they even seem
to appropriate the qualities of the king-<em>im&#257;m</em>; in
Epistle 47 they introduce themselves as the best guides for the
defence of Islam in terms of <em>al-hukam&#257;&rsquo; wa
al-fal&#257;sifa wa al-fudal&#257;&rsquo;</em> (&ldquo;wise men,
philosophers and excellent people&rdquo;) and of the
<em>anbiy&#257;&rsquo;</em>, <em>khulaf&#257;&rsquo;
al-anbiy&#257;&rsquo; wa</em> <em>al-a&rsquo;imma
al-mahdiy&#363;n</em> (&ldquo;prophets, successors of the prophets
and well-guided <em>imams</em>,&rdquo; IV, 126, 5&ndash;17). That the
Ikhw&#257;n aim to be the guides of the elect community is further
confirmed by a passage in Epistle 9. The ascetics are described as
those &ldquo;who know the shortcomings [of the world], who crave for
the hereafter and are convinced of it, firmly rooted in its science,
that is the sincere Friends of God, [His] faithful servants, the cream
of all [His] creatures, whom the Creator &ndash; may [He] be exalted
&ndash; called &lsquo;persons of understanding, persons of view,
persons of mind&rsquo;&rdquo; (I, 357, 5&ndash;9; cf.
Al&iacute;-de-Unzaga 2024, 160, 2&ndash;5 Arabic, 305 transl.). These
qualities correspond to those of the Ikhw&#257;n engaged, as the
leaders of their community, in their philosophy of salvation; but they
also fit the prophets and the <em>im&#257;ms</em> perfectly. From
this point of view the reading of the Holy Book our authors have in
mind &ndash; rather than a Sh&#299;&#703;i or
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; perspective &ndash; might be the
<em>ta&rsquo;w&#299;l</em> performed in their own encyclopedia, where
God&rsquo;s Word is continually quoted and commented (Baffioni 2012b;
Gobillot 2013). And they refer to the spiritual city as &ldquo;our
spiritual city,&rdquo; which coincides with Paradise.</p>

<p>
In Epistle 47 the legacy of the Prophet is said to be inherited by
&ldquo;the most intelligent&rdquo; (<em>al-&#703;uqal&#257;&rsquo;
al-akhy&#257;r</em>) which emphasizes the epistemological function of
the Sh&#299;&#703;ite caliph. In this case a temporal ruler, the
&ldquo;ruler <em>im&#257;m</em>,&rdquo; is no longer necessary
because the rational Law is the real guide, &ldquo;incarnated&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;rightly guided&rdquo; <em>im&#257;m</em> and in his
reason and knowledge. In contrast to Baffioni 2006, 149&ndash;150,
Heck (2008, 205&ndash;209) seems to side with Netton&rsquo;s reading
of the intellect-guide in terms of a rational intellect.</p>

<p>
Further elements allow a better defining of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s
political position. The history of early Islam is approached from a
Sh&#299;&#703;i perspective; some important events of the prophet
Muhammad&rsquo;s life and mission are recalled; soon attention shifts
to two fatal events which led to the defeat of Sh&#299;&#703;ism,
the battle of Siff&#299;n and the slaughter of Karbal&#257;&rsquo;.
In a passage on the struggles for im&#257;mate, the
&ldquo;representatives of the Muhammadic (<em>Muhammadiyya</em>) Law
and of the Hashimi federation&rdquo; (cf. Epistle 31, III, 165,
11&ndash;12; Ormsby 2021, 117, 6&ndash;8 Ar. and 196, transl.) are
opposed. If the latter are the &#703;Abbasids (or even the supporters
of Ab&#363; H&#257;shim, son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya), the
former should be understood as the direct descendants of the Prophet
through F&#257;tima, whence the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s strict
&#703;Alid militancy should be demonstrated.</p>

<p>
Another passage from Epistle 31 (III, 153, 11&ndash;156, 9) might urge
to suppose that the authors&rsquo; target was the caliph
al-Ma&rsquo;m&#363;n, in spite of his pro-&#703;Alid policy (and
political support of Mu&#703;tazilism). The Ikhw&#257;n report on a
ruler, who encouraged politico-religious controversies among the
<em>&lsquo;ulam&#257;&rsquo;</em> (learned) of different persuasions,
claiming for himself the right to interpret the Law on the basis of
the Mu&#703;tazilite doctrine of the created Qur&rsquo;&#257;n.
Juxtaposed to him is <em>ahl bayt al-nubuwwa</em> (the immediate
family of the Prophet: Muhammad, his daughter F&#257;tima, his cousin
and son-in-law &#703;Al&#299; and their sons, al-Hasan and
al-Husayn) as the guarantors of the true tradition concerning
prophetic succession. The Ikhw&#257;n could then still be identified
with the supporters of the strict &#703;Alid conception of the
imamate, according to which the science of caliphate belongs to the
family of the Prophet only.</p>

<p>
If this hypothesis is tenable, Epistle 31 contains not only the core
of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s political thought, but also of their
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; commitment. On the other hand, their
presentation of the &ldquo;perfect city,&rdquo; in which mutual love
is the basis and the goal of the community, does not help us to
ascertain whether the Ikhw&#257;n have in mind spiritual rule or a
true government such as that of the Fatimid caliph, of whom they might
be the <em>du&#703;&#257;&rsquo;</em>. Scholars tend to consider
this &ldquo;perfect city&rdquo; as utopian as the Farabian (cf. e.g.
Marquet 1973, 153; Hamdani 1999, 81). The defeat of evil people is
also often foreshadowed in the encyclopedia (cf. e.g. Epistle 31, III,
154, 19&ndash;24 and 156, 2&ndash;3). In Epistle 4 the Ikhw&#257;n
present a cyclical conception of ruling dynasties, and state that
&ldquo;the dynasty of the evil reached its apex,&rdquo; hence only
decline and diminution are to be expected in the future. According to
Tibawi (1955, 37, note 4), the Ikhw&#257;n forebode here the fall of
the &#703;Abbasids. Cf. also Tibawi, 1978, 60.) The dynasty of the
good begins when the learned agree &ldquo;on a unique doctrinal school
and a single religion,&rdquo; commit themselves to mutual help, and
desire the vision of God and doing God&rsquo;s will as their [sole]
reward (I, 181, 14&ndash;182, 2). In Epistle 48, the Ikhw&#257;n
declare that the one whose advent in the world is expected is coming,
and it will be a wonderful event (IV, 190, 13), in which the welfare
of both religion and the world will be gathered. Magic, astronomy and
true dreams helped them establish even the year and month of the
advent of the &ldquo;lord of the cycle&rdquo; (<em>s&#257;hib
al-amr</em>) &ndash; but, of course, the date is not mentioned in the
encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
Recently, Kacimi has returned to these issues. According to Kacimi
2019, 369 ff., the Ikhw&#257;n displayed Sh&#299;&#703;&#299;
tendencies and opposed the &#703;Abbasids. In fact, they favoured the
annihilation of the &ldquo;kingdom of evil&rdquo; (<em>dawlat ahl
al-sharr</em>) and the establishment of the &ldquo;kingdom of
good&rdquo; (<em>dawlat ahl al-khayr</em>). The epistles conceal a
political project made explicit in the <em>J&#257;mi&#703;a</em>
(unlike the encyclopedia, the <em>J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> defends the
Seveners&rsquo; doctrine, according to Kacimi 2019, 378). The
Ikhw&#257;n may have had an Ismaili identity from the beginning, but
this is not patently evident in the epistles due to both the use of
<em>taqiyya</em> and the political strategy of not declaring
one&rsquo;s beliefs in order to attract individuals of different
doctrinal backgrounds (Kacimi 2024, 210). For this reason, the
<em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> do not indicate the time or place of
composition, despite the authors&rsquo; claims about the antiquity of
their prophetic and philosophical doctrine. Kacimi also disputes the
idea that the Brethren were Qarmats, despite a passage in the
<em>J&#257;mi&#703;a</em> stating that their doctrine is ancient.
Instead, echoes of Zaydi thought can be found in the encyclopedia
(Kacimi 2019, passim). Zaydism was practised by the Buyids, who were
also strong advocates of philosophy (Kacimi 2019, 371 and Kacimi 2024,
202&ndash;203). Despite Moh. Jalub Farhan&rsquo;s description of the
Ikhw&#257;n as being opposed to the Buyid regime notwithstanding the
fact that the Buyids supported science (1999, 30&ndash;31), Kacimi
hypothesizes that the authors played a dual role between the Buyid and
Fatimid powers. In fact, they had a relationship with al-Mu&#703;izz,
which was in opposition to the &#703;Abbasids. However, shortly after
al-Mu&#703;izz&rsquo;s death, &#703;Adud al-Dawla appeared in
Baghdad in 367/977. A Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; who patronised
philosophical knowledge and believed in the illegitimacy of the
&#703;Abbasid caliphs, he appreciated philosophy. Following his death
in 982 and subsequent conflicts between his sons, prominent
Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&#702; members preached in favour of the
Fatimid state (Kacimi 2019, 378). De Smet and Krinis, however, reject
this hypothesis (De Smet 2014&ndash;2015, 297; Krinis 2016, 33; Kacimi
2024, 204).</p>

<p>
Grounding himself on the <em>S&#299;rat ibn &#7716;awshab</em> of the
Fatimid <em>d&#257;&#703;&#299;</em> Ja&#703;far b. Mans&#363;r
al-Yaman (d. second half of the 10<sup>th</sup> century), Hamdani
hypothesizes the epistles to have been written under Ahmad b.
&#703;Abd All&#257;h b. Mu&#7717;ammad b.
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&rsquo;s im&#257;mate, who was considered as
the expected <em>im&#257;m</em>. Ahmad, however, was not their
author, but their <em>munshi&rsquo;</em> (&ldquo;issuer&rdquo;).
Therefore, the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; would have been a
think-tank at the service of the Fatimid propaganda, a secret
organization with the function of gaining support from the
non-initiates (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 1&ndash;2). The Brethren who
cooperated in the final version of the encyclopedia in the tenth
century might have been disguised adversaries of the Buyids, who were
Sh&#299;&#703;ites, not Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis. Poonawala also
proposes the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> to have been written by
propagandists belonging to the entourage of Ahmad, half a century
after al-Ma&rsquo;m&#363;n (Walker et al. 2015, 66; De Smet 2017,
157&ndash;158). More recently, Hamdani has noted in the encyclopedia
also Sunni-Sufi elements; thereby, the Ikhw&#257;n would be a secret
think-tank made up of <em>taf&#7693;&#299;l&#299;</em> Sunnis (that
is, they assert the superiority of &#703;Al&#299; over all the
successors of the Prophet), who hoped to replace the &#703;Abbasids
with a &#703;Alid caliphate, displaying in their work also liberalism
and religious tolerance (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 32&ndash;33).</p>

<p>
On the whole, the political vision outlined above appears to be
founded on doctrinal elements of Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299;
nature. The division between the &ldquo;elect&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;masses&rdquo; destines the former only for investigation of the
<em>curriculum studiorum</em> at the basis of the &ldquo;philosophy of
salvation&rdquo;. A rigid hierarchy of universe links each level of
existence, physical and spiritual, to that which precedes and that
which follows it where the beings that belong to the various levels
cannot go beyond them. (It should be noted that this may question the
idea of &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; in the Ikhw&#257;n that some scholars
have ascribed to them; cf. e.g. Vernet Gin&eacute;s 1990, 190; Marquet
1992). The didactic aims of the ruler mirror the aspect of
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; propaganda known as
<em>ta&#703;l&#299;m</em> (lit.: &ldquo;teaching&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
The influence of the <em>Epistles</em> on later (after the 12th
century) Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; literature has been widely
recognized (Stern 1964, 416&ndash;417; Diwald 1975, 26 ff.; Daftary
2007, 236). Their content has been transmitted and developed by
subsequent thinkers of various persuasions. It is noteworthy, however,
that extended literal quotations (and even translations) from the
Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; are found in the famous
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; thinker and missionary N&#257;sir-e
Khosrow (1004&ndash;1074) (see Saccone 2007, 67&ndash;68; Baffioni
2013c and Poonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 285 ff.): this may be
a proof of the use of the <em>Ras&#257;&rsquo;il</em> in 11th century
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; authors. If the Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; were Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lis or in someway
linked to Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism, then
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism influenced a much wider part of Islamic
thought and culture than previously recognized.</p>

<p>
With regard to an Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; commitment to the
Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;, some aspects of their philosophy of
nature (geology, mineralogy, and botany) have been recently examined
(Baffioni 2008, 2009, 2010b; de Callata&yuml; 2008). Mineralogy and
botany have been explored in order to find similarities with
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; philosophy, in particular with the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; thinker and missionary Ham&#299;d
al-D&#299;n al-Kirm&#257;n&#299;. The result is that they share
many basic views, but the Ikhw&#257;n has greater detail. Moreover,
some aspects of the Ikhw&#257;n&rsquo;s cosmology, and in particular
their use of the term and concept of <em>ibd&#257;&#703;</em>, are
relevant in identifying the similarities (Baffioni 2011a; 2013b;
2013d).</p>

<p>
However, the radical change of hypotheses about the dating of the
epistles after the identification of the role that Maslama
al-Qurtub&#299; would have played in them, also led to rethinking the
political (and possibly messianic) beliefs of the Ikhw&#257;n and the
attempts to identify the polemical targets of their assertions.
Madelung remarks that while the Fatimids were used to see both
Umayyads and &#703;Abbasids as usurpers and enemies of
&#703;Al&#299;, the Ikhw&#257;n had no longer contacts with any
hidden <em>im&#257;m</em>, as they believe that the advent of the
Mahd&#299; has been delayed to a remote future. Therefore, they
adopted a quietist attitude towards the existing regimes: their
purpose was only to purify Islam through the study of ancient thought,
thus preparing humanity for the advent of the true
<em>Mahd&#299;</em>. Maslama al-Qurt&#803;ub&#299; remained a loyal
subject of the Umayyad governor of Andalus, &#703;Abd
al-Rah&#803;m&#257;n III. Hence, the Ikhw&#257;n no longer regarded
the Umayyads as the inveterate enemies of the Family of the Prophet.
The <em>im&#257;m</em>, direct descendants of the Prophet, are
instead described as the only ones entitled to rule humanity, and for
this purpose divinely chosen; but their persecutors &ndash; although
denounced as tyrants &ndash; are not identified. Kacimi 2019 returns
on the anti-&#703;Abbasid polemic of the Ikhw&#257;n.</p>

<p>
In Arjomand 2022, an opposing view is proposed that straightforwardly
includes the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; among the supporters of
revolutionary action within the context of messianic expectations.
Arjomand shares Hamdani&rsquo;s opinion that the oldest epistles
should be dated to the period of the &ldquo;concealed imamate&rdquo;
(<em>satr</em>)&mdash;that is, after the death of Hasan
al-&#703;Askar&#299; in 874 and before the establishment of the
Fatimid caliphate in 909&mdash;when &ldquo;the proof of God on his
earth is hidden and concealed.&rdquo; This is the reason why the
Epistles speak of &ldquo;rightly guided imams&rdquo;
(<em>a&rsquo;immat al-mahdiyyun</em>) in the plural. The addressed
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; would subsequently be the composer
(<em>munshi&rsquo;</em>) of the Epistles, identified as someone like
the <em>d&#257;&#703;i</em> Ibn Hawshab (d. 914). After Hasan
al-&#703;Askar&#299;&rsquo;s death, the Brethren worked for the
composer of the Epistles seeking to recruit members among the
<em>Im&#257;miyya</em>. The Brethren believed that the expected Imam
was not hidden, but present, though his opponents refuse to recognize
him (cf. Ep. 48, IV, 199). Such facts are considered to be close to
Ibn Hawshab&rsquo;s doctrine, behaviour, and accounts. The Qarmat
leader &#701;Abd&#257;n is said to have been one of the Brethren and
a contributor to their encyclopedia, if not its editor. The
encyclopedia would then be the &ldquo;ideological spearhead of the
clandestine movement of the circle of intellectuals&rdquo; that he
recruited with Hamd&#257;n Qarmat in the heartland of the
&#703;Abbasid caliphate (Arjomand 2022, 236). In their attempt at
mobilizing for their &ldquo;apocalyptic revolution&rdquo; the Brethren
ranked seven social classes among which the &ldquo;artisans and
craftsmen&rdquo;, &ldquo;businessmen and traders,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;construction engineers and workers&rdquo; are set in the three
first places. &ldquo;Kings, rulers, and statesmen&rdquo; are placed
after these, and men of religion and jurists, whom the heretical
Brethren had no hope of converting, are put at the bottom of the list
and sharply criticized. In doing so, they are consistent with the
social background who led the earliest Ism&#257;&#699;ili missions.
In their &ldquo;revolutionary program for government and a theory of
revolution,&rdquo; the Brethren underline the functions of prophecy
and kingship in the Persian wisdom. Philosophy is considered the most
important after prophecy; al-F&#257;r&#257;bi is even considered to
be &ldquo;a possible contributor&rdquo; of the encyclopedia. The
Brethren&rsquo;s goal is the constitution of a &ldquo;spiritual
city&rdquo; guided by reason (<em>&#699;aql</em>) through the lawgiver
(<em>al-ra&rsquo;&#299;s wa&rsquo;l-im&#257;m</em>) who will empower
the tradition of the Law. The authors consider the time of setting
this new rule as the &ldquo;millennial moment of the turn in power
among nations&rdquo; (Arjomand 2022, 237). In indicating the various
changes of government and religions, they use numerology and astrology
in the light of the latest findings of astronomy. The Brethren of
Purity reconciled the duodecimal system of the Zodiac with the heptads
of Judeo-Christian sacred history. The
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; <em>d&#257;&#703;i</em> Ab&#363;
&#703;Abdall&#257;h al-Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; addressed his
followers, to whom he imparted esoteric teachings, as
&ldquo;brethren&rdquo; and &ldquo;the People of the Good,&rdquo;
encouraging them to perform good deeds (<em>&#699;amal khayr</em>) as
a means of getting closer to God. By contrast, there was little or no
discussion of the current clandestine &#703;Alid leadership of the
movement. Even in 909, after overthrowing the Aghlabids, Ab&#363;
&#703;Abdall&#257;h al-Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; had not yet made up
his mind about the &ldquo;agreed upon (<em>al-rid&#257;</em>) from
the Household of the Prophet&rdquo; (Arjomand 2022, 246). Ultimately,
following Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Shalaghlagh&rsquo;s demise in late 909, he
embraced Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Shalaghlagh&rsquo;s nephew, whom he had
never encountered, as the Mahdi. At that moment, Ab&#363;
&#703;Abdall&#257;h wrote to the Brethren in Ifr&#299;qiya that God
had kept His promise and made one of His proofs appear on His earth
and rescued the son of the Messenger of God. However, the Fatimid
Mahdi made the Berber tribe Kut&#257;ma his natural allies against
the urban Epistle intellectuals, who were led by Ab&#363;
&#699;Abdall&#257;h al-Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; and his brother
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-&#699;Abb&#257;s. On Friday 5 January 910, he
ordered the preachers of Raqqada and Qayrawan to pray for him,
presenting himself as God&rsquo;s deputy (a term with which the Sunni
majority would have been familiar) but also equating himself with the
&ldquo;rightly guided&rdquo; imams who had been the subject of the
Brethren of Purity&rsquo;s discourses. On 18 February 911, the Fatimid
Mahdi had Ab&#363; &#703;Abdall&#257;h and
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-&#703;Abb&#257;s murdered during a midday dinner.
Subsequently, he rejected the millennial theory of the imminent return
of Muhammad b. Ism&#257;&#699;&#299;l and altered his genealogy,
claiming descent from &#699;Abdall&#257;h, the older brother of
Ism&#257;&#699;&#299;l b. Ja&#699;far, rather than
Ism&#257;&#699;&#299;l himself. Later, Q&#257;d&#299;
al-Nu&#703;m&#257;n refuted the idea that the imam&rsquo;s divine
appointment depended on the people, or that the head of state of the
&ldquo;People of the Good,&rdquo; as described in the Epistles, was in
any way dependent on them. However, the political astrology of the
Brethren of Purity was incorporated into the official ideology of the
Fatimid Empire following the conquest of Egypt and Syria in the late
tenth century. Conversely, Hasan Sabbah accepted the notion of
inspired teaching (<em>ta&#703;l&#299;m</em>) from
&#703;Abd&#257;n. After seizing the fortress of Alamut in 1090 and
establishing an Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; state comprising
numerous fortresses in northern and north-eastern Iran, he, like
Ab&#363; &#703;Abdall&#257;h al-Sh&#299;&#703;&#299;, strictly
enforced <em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em> until the
<em>q&#257;&rsquo;im</em> appeared. However, on 8 August 1164, Hasan
II b. Mohammad b. Bozorg-Omid proclaimed the Resurrection and refused
to wait for the appointed time calculated by the Brethren of
Purity.</p>

<p>
De Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy also approached the encyclopedia from a
radically new perspective. In de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy 2018, he
illustrates the so-called &ldquo;soteriological complementarism&rdquo;
of the Brethren of Purity. This concept helps us to understand how God
may want salvation for all people if He saves only to those who
followed His path. In order to resolve the contradictions of religious
theology, the path to salvation must contain all paths as parts of a
common journey. The Epistles show that no one will find salvation
without everyone else. The world is built on complementary
relationships: no one is self-sufficient, but together we can meet any
need. If people are different, their religions will be too &ndash; and
other creatures worship the Creator in their own way. The existence of
multiple communities does not imply pluralism: &ldquo;Le
caract&egrave;re r&eacute;gional des religions n&rsquo;implique pas
leur r&eacute;gionalisation.&rdquo; Rather, diversity in creation is
conceived as serving the whole, thus becoming a unity. We therefore
speak of &ldquo;complementarity&rdquo; &ndash; doctrinal, political,
and soteriological. In terms of psychophysical relationship, the soul
dominates the body because, unlike the body, it is destined for
eternal life. However, the body is the instrument through which the
soul is fulfilled. Consequently, salvation will no longer be a reward
for good deeds, but rather the capacity to enable the soul to separate
from the body. Good deeds therefore contribute to common salvation.
The salvation of one community will coincide with that of all
communities. At the cosmic level, the soul unites with matter because
it is through matter that it achieves ever higher levels of
organisation and formation. Salvation will consist of allowing the
Universal Soul to exist in matter, and then separate from it. This
requires the mobilisation of all creation. In de Vaulx d&rsquo;Arcy
2023, opposition to theological occasionalism &mdash; which denied
nature &mdash; was made in the early stages of philosophy (with
al-Kind&#299; and the Ras&#257;&rsquo;il Ikhw&#257;n
al-Saf&#257;&rsquo;). This affirms the independence of nature from
its Creator, explaining natural changes by the idea that the world is
a being that prostrates itself before God of its own volition. The
relationship between the Ikhw&#257;n al-Saf&#257;&rsquo; and the
Andalusi philosopher Ibn al-S&#299;d al-Batalyaws&#299; is explored
by De Callata&yuml; 2024 and Baffioni 2025. These are the first
attempt to demonstrate, on textual bases, that the encyclopedia was
known in Andalus since the early stages of Andalusan philosophy.</p>
