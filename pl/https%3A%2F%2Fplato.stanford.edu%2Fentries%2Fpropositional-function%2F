<h2 id="PreHis">1. Pre-History</h2>

<p>
Before we begin our discussion of propositional functions, it will be
helpful to note what came before their introduction. In traditional
logic, the role of propositional functions is approximately held by
<em>terms</em>. In traditional logic, statements such as &lsquo;dogs
are mammals&rsquo; are treated as postulating a relation between the
subject term, &lsquo;dog&rsquo;, and the predicate term,
&lsquo;mammal&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
A term is treated either extensionally as a class of objects (i.e. the
extension of the term) or intensionally as a set of properties (those
properties that are essential to something that satisfies the term).
The intensional treatment of &lsquo;dogs are mammals&rsquo; interprets
this sentence as true because the semantic interpretation of the
subject is a <em>superset</em> of the interpretation of the predicate.
For example, the &lsquo;intent&rsquo; of the term &lsquo;dog&rsquo;
includes all the properties that are included in the intent of
&lsquo;mammal&rsquo;. On the extensional treatment of the sentence,
however, the sentence is true because the interpretation of the
subject (the class of dogs) is a <em>subset</em> of the interpretation
of the predicate (the set of mammals).</p>

<p>
These two treatments of the predicate are typical of the two
traditions in traditional logic &ndash; the intensional and the
extensional traditions. Logicians who can be counted among the
intensional logicians are Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Lambert, William
Hamilton, Stanley Jevons, and Hugh MacColl. Among the extensional
logicians are George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, Charles Peirce, and
John Venn.</p>

<p>
The way that intensional logics treated certain categorical sentences
might seem strange to modern readers. The intension of a predicate, in
20<sup>th</sup> Century philosophy, includes only those properties
that any competent speaker of a language would associate with that
predicate. These properties are not enough to make true ordinary
statements like &lsquo;every dog in my house is asleep&rsquo;. But we
can make sense of the intensional view of terms by considering its
origins. One of the founders of the intensional logic tradition is
Leibniz, who thinks that all truths are grounded in the nature of
individuals. The complete concept of an individual contains everything
that is true of it. Building on this, we can see that the complete
concept of a term will include enough to ground any truth about it as
well.</p>

<p>
In both the intensional and extensional logic traditions, we see
theories of complex terms. In the extensional tradition, disjunctive
and conjunctive terms are interpreted by taking the union and
intersection of classes. The conjunctive term \(AB\) is interpreted as
the intersection of the class \(A\) and the class \(B\) and the
extension of the disjunctive term \(A{+}B\) is understood as the union
of the extensions of \(A\) and \(B\).</p>

<p>
In the intensional tradition, the reverse holds. The term \(AB\) is
interpreted as the union of the properties in the intent of \(A\) and
the intent of \(B\) and \(A{+}B\) is interpreted as the intersection
of the properties in the intents of \(A\) and \(B\). This reversal
makes sense, since more things fit a smaller number of properties and
fewer things fit a larger number of properties. As Leibniz says,</p>

<blockquote>
when I say <em>Every man is an animal</em> I mean that all men are
included amongst all the animals; but at the same time I mean that the
idea of animal is included in the idea of man. &lsquo;Animal&rsquo;
comprises more individuals than &lsquo;man&rsquo; does, but
&lsquo;man&rsquo; comprises more ideas or more attributes: one has
more instances, the other has more degrees of reality; one has the
greater extension, the other the greater intension. (Leibniz (1982)
486)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although some of the logicians working in term logic have very
complicated treatments of negation, we can see the origin of the
modern conception in the extensional tradition as well. In Boole and
most of his followers, the negation of a term is understood as the set
theoretic complement of the class represented by that term. For this
reason, the negation of classical propositional logic is often called
&lsquo;Boolean negation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
On the subject of Boole, interestingly, he interprets statements as
terms of a sort, as sets of times in which they are true. See the
entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boole/#MathAnalLogi1847">George Boole</a>
 for more about his logic and how he interprets it.</p>

<h2 id="LogRel">2. The Logic of Relatives</h2>

<p>
In Charles Peirce&rsquo;s &lsquo;Logic of Relatives&rsquo; (1883), we
see a theory that is in some ways intermediate between traditional
term logic and the treatment of predicate expressions as propositional
functions. One problem with traditional term logic is that it lacks
the ability to deal with relations. Peirce&rsquo;s logic of relatives
is meant to remedy that. He adds terms to Boolean algebra that
represent relations, and gives an extensional interpretation of them.
They are not propositional functions in the full sense. Peirce&rsquo;s
relatives are &lsquo;common names&rsquo; that represent classes of
pairs of objects (1883, 328). Thus, the logic of relatives represents
a generalization of traditional logic rather than a departure from
it.</p>

<p>
Peirce extends the algebra of terms to deal with particular features
of relations. Like other terms, we can have conjunctive, disjunctive,
and negative terms. Where \(f\) and \(g\) are relatives, then \(fg\)
represents the class of pairs \((I,J)\) such that \(I\) bears both
\(f\) and \(g\) to \(J\). Similarly, the disjunctive relative,
\(f{+}g\) is such that it represent \((I,J)\) if \(I\) bears either
\(f\) or \(g\) to \(J\) and \(f'\) &ndash; the negation of the term
\(f\) &ndash; represents the class of pairs \((I,J)\) such that \(f\)
does not hold between them. Peirce also has a composition operator,
\(;\) , such that \(f{;}g\) names \((I,J)\) if there is some entity
\(K\) such that \(f\) names \((I,K)\) and \(g\) names \((K,J)\).</p>

<p>
In &lsquo;The Critic of Arguments&rsquo; (1892), Peirce adopts a
notion that is even closer to that of a propositional function. There
he develops the concept of the &lsquo;rhema&rsquo;. He says the rhema
is like a relative term, but it is not a term. It contains a copula,
that is, when joined to the correct number of arguments it produces an
assertion. For example, &lsquo;__ is bought by __ from __ for
__&rsquo; is a four-place rhema. Applying it to four objects \(a, b,
c\), and \(d\) produces the assertion that \(a\) is bought by \(b\)
from \(c\) for \(d\) (ibid. 420).</p>

<p>
One especially interesting point about Peirce&rsquo;s rhema is that he
uses the same chemical analogy as Frege does when they discuss the
relation between relations and their arguments. They both compare
relations (and properties) to &lsquo;atoms or radicals with
unsaturated bonds&rsquo;. What exactly this analogy says of relations
or properties, either in Frege or Peirce is somewhat unclear.</p>

<p>
See the entry on
 <a href="../peirce-logic/">Peirce&rsquo;s logic</a>,
 for a more complete exposition of his work.</p>

<h2 id="ProFunBirMatLog">3. Propositional Functions and the Birth of Mathematical Logic</h2>

<p>
In the work of Giuseppe Peano (1858&ndash;1932), we find another
important step towards the modern notion of a propositional function.
Although his work is not as sophisticated as Frege&rsquo;s (see
below), it is important in particular because of its influence on
Bertrand Russell.</p>

<p>
In his &lsquo;Principles of Arithmetic Presented by a New
Method&rsquo; (1889), Peano introduces propositional connectives in
the modern sense (an implication, negation, conjunction, disjunction,
and a biconditional) and propositional constants (a verum and a
falsum).</p>

<p>
More important for us is his treatment of quantification. Peano allows
propositions to contain variables, that is to say, he utilizes open
formulas. He does not give an interpretation of open formulas. He does
not tell us what they represent. But they are used in his theory of
quantification. Peano only has a universal quantifier. He does not
define an existential quantifier in the &lsquo;Principles&rsquo;. The
quantifier is always attached to a conditional or biconditional.
Quantified propositions are always of the form</p>

<blockquote>
\(A \supset_{x,y,\ldots} B\)
</blockquote>

<p>
or</p>

<blockquote>
\(A =_{x,y,\ldots} B\)
</blockquote>

<p>
Peano reads &lsquo;\(A \supset_{x,y,\ldots} B\)&rsquo; as saying
&lsquo;whatever \(x,y,\ldots\) may be, from the proposition \(A\) one
deduces \(B\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;=&rsquo; is Peano&rsquo;s
biconditional, that he defines in the usual way from the conditional
and conjunction.</p>

<p>
Predication is understood, as in Boole and his followers, as set
membership. In the formula \(a\supset b\), the symbols
&lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(b\)&rsquo; denote classes and the
horseshoe (or hook) is a subset sign. Thus, the horseshoe is
understood in Peano as both material implication and as subset.
Variables are understood as &lsquo;indeterminate objects&rsquo;, but
Peano does not discuss what this means. (Frege later cricitises that
terminology as meaning nothing.)</p>

<h2 id="FreFunCon">4. Fregean Functions and Concepts</h2>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s central ontological distinction is between functions and
objects. A function is an unsaturated entity that requires an object
as its argument to be, in some sense, complete. In the
<em>Begriffsschrift</em>, we first see the interpretation of an atomic
sentence &ndash; \(\Phi(A)\) &ndash; as meaning that a function
\(\Phi\) is applied to an argument \(A\). In the Begriffsschrift,
formulae represent <em>judgeable contents</em>. Judgeable contents are
remarkably similar to Russellian propositions but also to
Bolzano&rsquo;s propositions-in-themselves and Meinong&rsquo;s
objectives.</p>

<p>
In the early 1890s, Frege rejects judgeable contents and instead comes
to think of sentences as repersenting sentential senses (or
&ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;) and, as their denotations, truth values (i.e.
the True and the False).</p>

<p>
Consider the sentence</p>

<blockquote>
My dog is asleep on the floor.
</blockquote>

<p>
This sentence, like all linguistic expressions, has both a sense and a
referent. Its sense is an abstract object &ndash; a thought. Its
referent is its truth value (which as I write this is the True). We
will discuss Frege&rsquo;s analysis of the thought soon, but right now
let us look at the referents of the expressions that make up this
sentence.</p>

<p>
The expression &lsquo;my dog&rsquo;, according to Frege, is a singular
term. It picks out an object (my dog, Zermela). The expression
&lsquo;is asleep on the floor&rsquo; refers to a <em>concept</em>.
Concepts are functions of a sort. In this case, the concept is a
function from objects to truth values (which are also objects). So, we
can treat the above sentence as representing the concept __ <em>is
asleep on the floor</em> as applying to the object <em>my
dog</em>.</p>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s concepts are very nearly propositional functions in the
modern sense. Frege explicitly recognizes them as functions. A
concept, like any other function and like Peirce&rsquo;s rhema, is
<em>unsaturated</em>. They are in some sense incomplete. Although
Frege never gets beyond the metaphorical in his description of the
incompleteness of concepts and other functions, one thing is clear:
the distinction between objects and functions is the main division in
his metaphysics. There is <em>something</em> special about functions
that makes them very different from objects and this something is
their unsaturatedness.</p>

<p>
Let us consider &lsquo;my dog is asleep on the floor&rsquo; again.
Frege thinks that this sentence can be analyzed in various different
ways. Instead of treating it as expressing the application of __
<em>is asleep on the floor</em> to <em>my dog</em>, we can think of it
as expressing the application of the concept</p>

<blockquote>
<em>my dog is asleep on</em> __
</blockquote>

<p>
to the object</p>

<blockquote>
<em>the floor</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
(see Frege 1919). Frege recognizes what is now a commonplace in the
logical analysis of natural language. <em>We can attribute more than
one logical form to a single sentence</em>. Let us call this the
<strong>principle of multiple analyses</strong>. Frege does not claim
that the principle always holds, but as we shall see, modern type
theory does claim this.</p>

<p>
With regard to the sense of sentences, they are also the result of
applying functions to objects. The sense of &lsquo;my dog&rsquo; is an
abstract object. The sense of &lsquo;is asleep on the floor&rsquo; is
a function from individual senses, like that of &lsquo;my dog&rsquo;,
to thoughts (see Frege 1891). The sense of &lsquo;is asleep on the
floor&rsquo; is a <em>conceptual sense</em>. It would seem that the
principle of multiple analyses holds as much for senses as it does for
referents. Frege, however, sometimes talks as if the senses of the
constituent expressions of a sentence are actually contained somehow
in the thought. It is difficult to understand how all such senses
could be in the thought if there are different ways in which the
sentence can be analyzed into constituent expressions.</p>

<p>
In addition to concepts and conceptual senses, Frege holds that there
are extensions of concepts. Frege calls an extension of a concept a
&lsquo;course of values&rsquo;. A course of values is determined by
the value that the concept has for each of its arguments. Thus, the
course of values for the concept __ <em>is a dog</em> records that its
value for the argument Zermela is the True and for Socrates is the
False, and so on. If two concepts have the same values for every
argument, then their courses of values are the same. Thus, courses of
values are extensional.</p>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s strict ontological division of entities into functions
and objects leads to some rather interesting problems. Take, for
example, his infamous claim that the phrase &ldquo;the concept
horse&rdquo; does not denote a concept. Concepts are all functions,
but &ldquo;the concept horse&rdquo; is something that can be used as
the subject of a sentence, and hence names an object. Nothing for
Frege can be both an object and a function. Thus, &ldquo;the concept
horse&rdquo; must name something else, an object that represents the
concept (see Frege (1892) and Parsons (1986)). This view makes for a
rather complicated theory of reference and a rather complicated
understanding of how Frege&rsquo;s philosophical metalanguage can
accurately describe his own ontology.</p>

<p>
For more about Frege&rsquo;s theory of concepts and its relation to
his logic, see the entry on
 <a href="../frege-theorem/">Frege&rsquo;s theorem and foundations for arithmetic</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="EmeProFun">5. The Emergence of Propositional Functions</h2>

<p>
The term &lsquo;propositional function&rsquo; appears in print for the
first time in Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s <em>Principles of
Mathematics</em> (1903). Russell introduces the notion through a
discussion of kinds of propositions. Consider propositions of the type
that says of something that it is a dog. This is the kind &lsquo;\(x\)
is a dog&rsquo;. This kind is a propositional function that takes any
object \(o\) to the proposition that \(o\) is a dog.</p>

<p>
In this early period, Russell holds that propositions are entities
that have individuals and properties and relations as constituents.
The proposition that Socrates is a man has Socrates and the property
of being a man as constituents. In complex propositions the relation
between propositional function and the proposition is less clear. Like
Frege, Russell allows the abstraction of a propositional function from
any omission of an entity from a proposition. Thus, we can view the
proposition</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>if Socrates drinks hemlock he will die</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
as representing the application of the function</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>x drinks hemlock \(\supset\) x will die</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
to Socrates, or the function</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Socrates will drink x \(\supset\) Socrates will die</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
to hemlock, and so on. In other words, Russell accepts the principle
of multiple analyses.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Principles</em>, the quantifier &lsquo;all&rsquo; is
analyzed as a part of referring phrases that pick out classes (1903,
72). This, we can see, is a hold-over from the 19<sup>th</sup> Century
extensional logicians (see Section 1). But in slightly later works,
such as &lsquo;On Denoting&rsquo; (1905), propositional functions are
said to be constituents of universal propositions. According to this
analysis the proposition expressed by sentences such as &lsquo;All
dogs bark&rsquo; is made up of the propositional function <em>x is a
dog</em> \(\supset\) <em>x barks</em> and a function (of propositional
functions) that is represented by the quantifier phrase
&lsquo;all&rsquo;. Quantified propositions are interesting for us
because they contain propositional functions as constituents.</p>

<p>
In what follows, Russell&rsquo;s notation is used to represent
Russell&rsquo;s propositional functions. (Lambda notation is used in
the discussion of Montague grammar). Here is a simple example: where
&lsquo;\(R(a,b)\)&rsquo; is a well-formed formula,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{x}R(x,b), \hat{y}R(a,y), \hat{x}\hat{y}R(x,y), \hat{X}X(a,b),
\ldots \)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
are propositional functions. More generally, where \(A(x)\) is an open
formula,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{x}A(x)\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
is a propositional function.</p>

<h2 id="ProFunSimTypThe">6. Propositional Functions in Simple Type Theory</h2>

<p>
While writing the <em>Principles of Mathematics</em>, Russell
discovered the paradox that now bears his name. Before we get to
Russell&rsquo;s paradox, let us discuss some the method of
<strong>diagonalization</strong> by which this and many other
paradoxes are generated.</p>

<p>
The power set of a set \(S, \wp S\) contains all the subsets of \(S\).
Georg Cantor (1845&ndash;1918) used the method of diagonalization to
show that for any set \(S, \wp S\) is larger than \(S\).</p>

<p>
Here is Cantor&rsquo;s proof. Suppose that \(\wp S\) and \(S\) are the
same size. Then, by the set-theoretic definition of &ldquo;same
size&rdquo; (more correctly, &lsquo;same cardinality&rsquo;) there is
a one-to-one <strong>surjection</strong> between \(S\) and \(\wp S\).
This means that there is a function that matches up each member of
\(S\) with a unique member of \(\wp S\) so that there are no members
of \(\wp S\) left over. Let us call this function, \(f\). Then, if
\(x\) is a member of \(S, f(x)\) is in \(\wp S\). Now, since \(\wp S\)
is the power set of \(S\), it may be that \(x\) is in \(f(x)\) or it
may not be in \(f(x)\). Let us now define a set \(C\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(C = \{x \in S: x \not\in f(x)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly, \(C\) is a subset of \(S\), so it is in \(\wp S\). By
hypothesis, \(f\) is \(\mathbf{onto}\) &ndash; for every member \(y\)
of \(\wp S\), there is an \(x \in S\) such that \(f(x) = y\). Thus
there must be some \(c \in S\) such that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(f(c) = C\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, either</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(c \in C\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(c \not\in C\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that \(c\) is in \(C\). Then, by the definition of \(C, c\) is
not in \(f(c)\). That is to say, \(c \not\in C\). But, if \(c\) is not
in \(C\), then \(c \not\in f(c)\). So, by the definition of \(C, c\)
is in \(C\). Thus,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(c\) is in \(C\) if and only if \(c\) is not in \(C\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, the assumption that a set is the same size as its power set
leads to a paradox, and so this assumption must be false.</p>

<p>
Cantor&rsquo;s theorem has important consequences for the theory of
propositional functions. Consider a model for a (first-order) logical
language that has a domain \(D\). The variables of the language range
over members of \(D\). Now let us add predicate variables to the
language. These stand for propositional functions. How are we to
interpret them in the model? The standard way of doing so &ndash; that
is inherited from the extensional logic tradition &ndash; is to have
predicate variables range over subsets of the domain. A model in which
predicate variables range over all subsets of the domain is called a
&lsquo;standard model&rsquo; for second-order logic. Cantor&rsquo;s
theorem tells us that the domain for predicate variables in the
standard model is larger than the domain for individual variables. If
we have predicates of predicates, then the domain for third order
predicates is even larger. And so on.</p>

<p>
Russell&rsquo;s paradox is very closely related to Cantor&rsquo;s
theorem. There are two versions of the paradox: (1) the class version;
(2) the propositional function version. This entry only discusses the
propositional function version of the paradox.</p>

<p>
In his early writings, Russell wants logic to be a universal science.
It should allow us to talk about properties of everything. By this he
means that the variables in logic should be taken to range over all
entities. But propositional functions, at least in the
<em>Principles</em>, are entities. So variables should range over
them. Let&rsquo;s consider a logic in which variables range over both
individuals and propositional functions &ndash; and propositional
functions are all of only a single type. Now consider the predicate
\(R\) such that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\forall x)(Rx = \neg xx)\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(This may look ill-formed, but that&rsquo;s because we are used to
making type distinctions. This is a discussion of what happens when we
don&rsquo;t make those distinctions.)&nbsp;If we instantiate and
substitute \(R\) for \(x\), we obtain</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(RR \equiv \neg RR\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems, then, that the treatment of variables as completely general
together with the liberty to define propositional functions by means
of any well-formed formula enables us to derive a contradiction.</p>

<p>
Russell blocks the contradiction in the <em>Principles</em> by the
introduction of a theory of types. This is a simple theory of types,
that only distinguishes between the types of various propositional
functions (or, in its class-form, of classes). Let us depart from
Russell&rsquo;s own exposition of the theory of types in order to give
a more rigorous and more modern version of the theory. This will make
my presentations of the ramified theory of types and more modern
versions of type theory easier.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll use one basic type, \(i\) (the type of individuals) and
define the types as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(i\) is a type;</li>

<li>if \(t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n\) are types, then so is \(\langle t_1,
\ldots ,t_n\rangle\), where \(n \ge 0\).</li>

<li>Nothing else is a type except by repeated applications of (1) and
(2).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The type \(\langle t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n\rangle\) is the type of a relation
among entities of types \(t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n\). But, for simplicity, we
will interpret this as the type of a function that takes these
entities to a proposition. (Note that when \(n = 0\), then the empty
type, \(\langle \rangle\), is the type for propositions.) This
definition incorporates the idea of a well-founded structure. There
are no cycles here. We cannot have a function that takes as an
argument a function of the same or higher type. Thus, simple type
theory bans the sort of self-application that gives rise to
Russell&rsquo;s paradox.</p>

<p>
The type hierarchy corresponds neatly to the hierarchy of domains that
we saw in our discussion of Cantor&rsquo;s theorem. A unary predicate
has the type \(\langle i\rangle\); its domain is \(D\) &ndash; the set
of individuals. A unary predicate of predicates has the type \(\langle
\langle i\rangle \rangle\), and this corresponds to the domain of
subsets of \(D\). And so on.</p>

<p>
For more, see the entry on
 <a href="../russell-paradox/">Russell&rsquo;s paradox</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="ProFunRamTypThe">7. Propositional Functions in Ramified Type Theory</h2>

<p>
After the <em>Principles</em>, however, Russell comes to believe that
the simple theory of types is insufficient. The reason for it has to
do with the <em>liar paradox</em>. Suppose that &lsquo;\(L\)&rsquo; is
a name for the proposition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(L\) is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This statement is false if and only if it is true. The problem here
has something to do with self-reference, but it cannot be avoided by
the simple theory of types alone. For simple types only give us a
hierarchy of types of propositional functions. In simple type theory,
all propositions have the same type.</p>

<p>
The idea behind ramified type theory is to introduce a hierarchy of
propositions as well. On this view, propositions and propositional
functions have an <em>order</em>. If a propositional function is
applied to a proposition of a particular order, then it yields a
proposition of a higher order. And every function must have a higher
order than its arguments. Thus, we avoid the liar paradox by banning a
proposition from occurring within itself. If a proposition \(p\)
occurs within another proposition, as the argument of a function such
as <em>x is false</em>, then the resulting proposition is of a higher
order than \(p\).</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Russell never gives a precise formulation of ramified
type theory. Perhaps the best formulation is due to Alonzo Church
 (1976).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Almost at the same time as he adopts the ramified theory of types,
Russell abandons propositions. From about 1908 until 1918, although
Russell retains the idea that there are true propositions (i.e. he
accepts facts), he denies that there are false ones. When we think
about something that is false, say, <em>Zermela is a cat</em>, we are
not thinking about a false proposition, but rather the objects of our
thought are just Zermela and the property of being a cat. It might
seem odd to have a hierarchy especially designed to stratify the
propositions and then claim that there are no propositions. Some
interpreters, however, have claimed that Russell&rsquo;s denial of the
existence of propositions should not be taken seriously and that there
are very good reasons to read <em>Principia</em> as being largely a
theory of propositions (see Church 1984).</p>

<p>
One reason to take the ramified theory of types seriously (even
without accepting propositions) is that it can be usefully
incorporated into a substitutional theory of quantification. On the
substitutional interpretation of the quantifiers, a universally
quantified formula such as \((\forall x)Fx\) is true if and only if
all of its instances \(Fa_1, Fa_2, Fa_3,\ldots\) are true. Similarly,
\((\forall x)Fx\) is true if and only if at least one of its instances
is true.</p>

<p>
Consider a substitutional interpretation of quantifiers with variables
ranging over predicates, as in the formula, \((\forall P)Pa\). This
formula is true if and only if all of its instances are true. On a
simple theory of types, the type of the variable \(P\) is \(\langle
i\rangle\), since its arguments are all individuals (or singular
terms). But the simple type of the function, \((\forall P)Px\) is also
\(\langle i \rangle\). So an instance of \((\forall P)Pa\) is
\((\forall P)Pa\) itself. A substitutional interpretation of the
quantifiers requires that instances be simpler than the formulas of
which they are instances. In this case, all we find out is that a
particular formula is true only if it is true. This is uninformative
and it seems viciously circular.</p>

<p>
To block this sort of circularity, we can turn to the ramified theory
of types. On the ramified theory, the propositional function
\((\forall P)Px\) is of order 2, because of the presence of the
quantifier binding a variable of order 1. In this way, the ramified
theory forces formulas to be simpler (at least in terms of order) than
the formulas of which they are instances (see Hazen and Davoren
2000).</p>

<h2 id="N8UniProFun"> 8. Universals and Propositional Functions</h2>

<p>
In <em>The Problems of Philosophy</em> (1912), Russell gives a
sustained argument for the existence of universals. A universal is an
entity that can exist in many different things. It is predicable of
those things and, in may cases, is supposedly perceptable in them. As
Russell says, we are &ldquo;acquainted&rdquo; with them. Although
propositional functions are often used to represent universals&rsquo;
holding of things, propositional function and universal are distinct
ontological categories.</p>

<p>
Linsky (1999) argues that Russell distinguished between propositional
functions and universals, and it would be difficult to see how he
could have identified them. When Russell believed in propositions, he
thought of propositions as complex structures of individuals and
universals. Consider, for example, the proposition that Dave loves
Carol:</p>

<blockquote>
\(\langle\Loves,d,c\rangle\)
</blockquote>

<p>
The principle of multiple analyses allows us to construct several
different propositional functions from this proposition. Among them
are those that are represented by the following expressions:</p>

<blockquote>
\(\hat{x}\Loves(x,c), \hat{y}\Loves(d,y), \hat{R}R(d,c), \ldots\)
</blockquote>

<p>
Russell continued to believe in the existence of universals, even
after he had abandoned propositions. This view is discussed further in
section
 <a href="#WhaProFunRus">section 9</a>.</p>
 
<p>
To move away from discussing Russell for a moment, George Bealer
(1989) gives some general reasons for distinguishing between
universals and propositional functions. Here is one of his arguments.
Our modern notion of a function is an extensional one: if functions
\(f\) and g have the same values for every argument, then \(f\) and
\(g\) are identical with one another. But our notion of a universal
(or a property) is intensional. We could live in a world in which
every round thing is red and every red thing is round, but this would
not make roundness and redness the same property. We might even want
to distinguish between two properties that are necessarily
co-extensive. Consider the property of being a possible world that
satisfies the law of excluded middle and being a possible world that
satisfies the law of non-contradiction. These two laws are logically
equivalent, but we might want, in order to provide an adequate theory
of intentionality, say, to distinguish these two properties. But the
corresponding propositional functions would be the same.</p>

<h2 id="WhaProFunRus">9. What is a Propositional Function in Russell?</h2>

<p>
After 1905, we see in Russell a parsimonious inclination. He wants to
prune a number of entities from his ontology. Some time between 1908
and 1910 he begins to deny the existence of propositions and this
denial continues until he develops a theory of propositions as
structures of images or words in (1918). What, then, is the fate of
propositional functions? The logicism of <em>Principia</em> needs
propositional functions. Facts about classes (which form the basis of
the reduction of mathematics to logic) are reducible to facts about
propositional functions. If propositional functions themelves
disappear altogether, then, the nature of the logicist reduction
becomes completely obscure.</p>

<p>
Whitehead and Russell say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By a &lsquo;propositional function&rsquo; we mean something which
contains a variable \(x\), and expresses a proposition as soon as a
value is assigned to \(x\). That is to say, it differs from a
proposition solely by the fact that it is ambiguous: it contains a
variable of which the value is unassigned. (1910, 38).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this passage, it seems as though they are saying that a
propositional function is an ambiguous proposition, but it is unclear
exatly what that means.</p>

<p>
What it does mean is a matter of debate among Russell scholars. On the
realist side are the interpretations given by Alonzo Church (1984) and
Warren Goldfarb (1989). Goldfarb thinks that the logical theory of
<em>Principia</em> is motivated by Russell&rsquo;s attempt to find the
real nature of propositional functions and that this nature is
independent of our thinking about it. Goldfarb has a good point, since
Russell&rsquo;s logic is supposed to be a perspicuous representation
of the way things actually are. Thus Goldfarb interprets Russell as a
Platonist about propositional functions.</p>

<p>
Landini (1998) argues that this realist interpretation cannot be
correct. By the time that Whitehead and Russell had began to write
<em>Principia</em>, Russell had already rejected the existence of
propositions. Without the existence of propositions, what sense can we
make of the claim that propositional variables are ambiguous
propositions? Landini answers that the only entities that Russell has
in his ontology that can do the jobs that propositional functions are
supposed to do are linguistic entities: open formulas ((1998) p
277).</p>

<p>
A position that occupies a middle ground between the realism of Church
and Goldfarb and Landini&rsquo;s nominalism is the logical
constructivist view. This is put forward by Kurt G&ouml;del (1944). On
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s interpretation, Russell&rsquo;s propositional
functions are human constructs of some sort. They depend on our
ability to think about them or refer to them. But it seems that when
Whitehead and Russell quantify over them in <em>Principia</em>, there
need to be more propositional functions than anyone every has or ever
will imagine. A different version of the constructive interpretation
can be found in Linsky (1999). On this view, propositional functions
are logical constructions, which depend on the abstractions that one
<em>could</em> make, rather than the ones that are in fact made.</p>

<p>
With regard to abstractions, however, it would seem that propositional
functions must be abstracted from something that actually exists. If
propositions do not exist, then there must be something else that from
which propositional functions are abstracted. One possibility is that
propositional functions are abstracted from facts. Consider again the
proposition that Dave loves Carol. Suppose that Dave and Carol do not
even know each other. But they do have some relation to one another.
Perhaps they live 150 miles from one another. Thus, there is a fact,
\(\langle M,d,c\rangle\). We can then abstract the propositional
functions</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{R}R(d,c), \hat{R}\hat{x}\hat{y}R(x,y), \ldots.\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can then construct other functions, such as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{R}(\hat{x}R(x,c))\Loves,\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
which is extensionally the same as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{x}\Loves(x,c).\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\hat{R}R(d,c)\Loves, \hat{x}\Loves(x,c)d, \ldots \)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and similar constructions are not the same as the proposition that
Dave loves Carol. That proposition, if it exists (and is a
&ldquo;Russellian proposition&rdquo;), is not a construction and does
not have propositional functions as constituents. But we should also
note that the construction of propositional functions allows that
there do exist these sorts of <em>complete</em> constructions that
might substitute for propositions in some contexts.</p>

<h2 id="PosWorProFun">10. Possible Worlds and Propositional Functions</h2>

<p>
Jumping ahead some decades, adding possible worlds together with set
theory to the logicians&rsquo; toolbox has provided them with a very
powerful and flexible framework for doing semantics.</p>

<p>
The modern notion of a function was discussed briefly in
 <a href="#WhaProFunRus">section 8</a>.
 Here we need to say a bit more about it. From a set theoretic point
of view, a function is a set of ordered pairs. If \(\langle
a,b\rangle\) is in a function \(f\), this means that the value of
\(f\) for the argument \(a\) is \(b\) or, more concisely, \(f(a) =
b\). By the mathematical definition of a function, for each argument
of a total (as opposed to partial) function there is one and only one
value. So, if the ordered pair \(\langle a,b\rangle\) is in a function
\(f\) and so is \(\langle a,c\rangle\), then \(b\) is the same thing
as \(c\). (A total function is a function that has a value for any
argument. Thus, for example, the function \(x^2\) is total, when its
domain is the natural numbers. The function \(1/x\), however, is
partial on that same domain. It has values for all values of \(x\)
except 0. A partial function, then, is one that is undefined when
given certain arguments. It would make sense to discuss partial
propositional functions if the topic of truth-value gaps were to be
included in this entry.)</p>

<p>
The possible worlds construction of propositional functions begins
with possible worlds, individuals, and some simple set theory. Let us
call the set of possible worlds \(W\). A proposition is a set of
possible worlds. The proposition that Zermela barks, for example, is
all the sets of worlds in which Zermela barks. We also need to assume
that there is a set \(I\) of possible individuals (i.e., the
individuals that exist in at least one possible world). We now have
all the materials to construct a simple type-theoretic hierarchy of
functions.</p>

<p>
The usual treatment of the meaning of predicates differs slightly from
the manner described here. Usually, the intension of a predicate is
taken to be a function from possible worlds to sets of individuals (or
sets of ordered pairs of individuals for binary relations, ordered
triples for three place relations, and so on). Strictly speaking,
these functions are not propositional functions because they do not
take propositions as values. But for each such function, we can
construct an &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo; propositional function by using
a process called &lsquo;Currying&rsquo; after the logician Haskell
Curry. Let&rsquo;s start with a function \(f\) from worlds to sets of
individuals. Then we can construct the corresponding propositional
function \(g\) as follows. For each world \(w\) and individual \(i\),
we construct \(g\) so that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(w\) is in \(g(i)\) if and only if \(i\) is in \(f(w)\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, the more standard treatment of the meanings of predicates is
really equivalent to the use of propositional functions.</p>

<h2 id="MonSem">11. Montague Semantics</h2>

<p>
Now that we have a whole hierarchy of propositional functions, we
should find some work for them to do. One theory in which
propositional functions do good work is Montague semantics, developed
in the late 1960s by Richard Montague.</p>

<p>
In order to understand Montague&rsquo;s method we need to understand
<em>lambda abstraction</em>. Lambda abstracts are very similar to
Russell&rsquo;s circumfex variable binders for propositional
functions. For the formula \(A(x)\) we read the expression \(\lambda
x[A(x)]\) as a predicate expression. Its extension (in a given
possible world) is the set of things that satisfy the formula
\(A(x)\). Lambda abstractors are governed by two rules, known as
\(\alpha\)-conversion and \(\beta\)-reduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\alpha\)-con) \(A(a)\) (a formula with \(a\) free for \(x)\) can be
replaced by \(\lambda x[A(x)]a\).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\beta\)-red) \(\lambda x[A(x)]a\) can be replaced by \(A(a)\)
(where \(x\) is free for \(a\) in \(A(x))\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because of the equivalence between a formula \(A(x)\) and \(\lambda
x[A(x)]a\), one might wonder why add lambda abstractors to our
language. In Montague semantics, the answer has to do with the very
direct way that he translates expressions of natural languages into
his logical language. We will discuss that soon, but first let us
learn a bit about Montague&rsquo;s <em>intensional logic</em>.</p>

<p>
Montague adds two other pieces of notation to his language:
\(^{\wedge}\) and \(^{\vee}\). The expression \(^{\wedge}\lambda
x[Fx]\) represents a function from worlds to sets of individuals.
Given a possible world \(w, ^{\wedge}\lambda x[Fx]\) represents a
function that takes \(w\) to the extension of \(\lambda x[Fx]\). The
operator \(^{\vee}\) takes expressions of the form \(^{\wedge}\lambda
x[Fx]\) &lsquo;down&rsquo; to their extensions at the world in which
the expression is being evaluated. For example, the extension of
\(^{\vee\wedge}\lambda x[Fx]\) at \(w\) is just the same as the
extension of \(\lambda x[Fx]\) at \(w\).</p>

<p>
What is so special about Montague semantics is that it can be used in
a very direct way as a semantics for large fragments of natural
languages. Consider the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Zermela barks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The meaning of this sentence is understood in Montague semantics as a
structure of the meanings of its constituent expressions. Montague
represents the meanings of expressions using translation rules. Here
we use the following translation rules:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Zermela</strong> translates into \(\lambda
P[(^{\vee}P)z]\)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>barks</strong> translates into \(^{\wedge}B\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now we can construct a formula that gives the meaning of
&lsquo;Zermela barks&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\lambda P[(^{\vee}P)z]^{\wedge}B\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that in constructing the sentence we place the expressions in
the same order in which they occur in English. The use of lambda
abstracts allows us to reverse the order of two expressions from the
way in which they would appear in ordinary statements of a formal
logical language (that does not have lambdas). Now we can use
\(\beta\)-reduction to obtain:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((^{\vee \wedge}B)z\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And now we apply Montague&rsquo;s rule to eliminate \(^{\vee
\wedge}\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(Bz\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this process we start with an expression that has the same order of
expressions as the original English sentence and then reduce it to a
very standard formula of logic. This tells us that the truth condition
of the sentence &lsquo;Zermela barks&rsquo; is the set of worlds that
is the proposition expressed by \(Bz\). Of course we knew that
independently of Montague&rsquo;s work, but the point is that the
Montague reduction shows us how we can connect the surface grammar of
English sentences to the formula of our logical language. The formula
of standard logic, moreover, displays its truth-conditions in a very
perspicuous way. So, the Montague reduction shows us the connection
between sentences of natural languages to their truth conditions.</p>

<h2 id="CatGra">12. Categorial Grammar</h2>

<p>
Categorial grammars were first constructed in the 1930s by Kazamir
Ajdukiewicz (1890&ndash;1963), and developed by Yehoshua Bar Hillel
(1915&ndash;1975) and Joachim Lambek (1922&ndash;2014) in the 1950s an
1960s. Categorial grammars are logical tools for representing the
syntax of languages.</p>

<p>
In categorial grammar, the syntax of languages is represented using a
different sort of generalization of the functional notation than in
Montague semantics. In Montague Semantics, the lambda abstractor is
used to move the meaning of an expression to the location that the
expression occupies in a sentence. In categorial grammar, predicates
and many other sorts of expressions are taken to be functions of
sorts. But there is a distinction in categorial grammar between two
sorts of application of a function to its arguments.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s see how this works. Let&rsquo;s start with the primitive
types CN (common noun) and NP (noun phrase). The indefinite article
&lsquo;a&rsquo; takes a common noun (on its right) and returns a NP.
So it has the type NP/CN. The common noun &lsquo;dog&rsquo;, of
course, has the type CN. We write &lsquo;\(A\) has the type
\(T\)&rsquo; as &lsquo;\(A\vdash T\)&rsquo;. So we have,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a} \vdash\) NP/CN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\mathbf{dog} \vdash\) CN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In order to put these two sequents together, we can use a form of the
rule modus ponens which says that from a sequent \(X \vdash A/B\) and
a sequent \(Y \vdash B\), we can derive the sequent \(X{.}Y \vdash
A\). We can use this rule to derive:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a}.\mathbf{dog} \vdash\) NP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, an intransitive verb has the type NP\S, where S is the type
of sentences. The backslash in NP\S means that the expression takes an
argument of type NP <em>on the left side</em> and returns an
expression of type S. The verb &lsquo;barks&rsquo; is intransitive,
that is,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>barks</strong> \(\vdash\) NP\S</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The version of modus ponens that we use with the backslash is slightly
different. It tells us that from \(X \vdash A \backslash B\) and \(Y \vdash
A\) we can derive \(Y{.}X \vdash B\). So we now can obtain,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((\mathbf{a}.\mathbf{dog})\).<strong>barks</strong> \(\vdash\) S</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This says that &lsquo;a dog barks&rsquo; is a sentence.</p>

<p>
The logics used to describe grammars in this way are
 <a href="../logic-substructural/">substructural logics</a>.</p>
 
<p>
What is of interest to us here is that in categorial grammars
determiners such as &lsquo;a&rsquo; and verbs are thought of as
functions, but they can differ from one another in terms of whether
they take arguments on their right or on their left. In the set
theoretic concept of function as a set of ordered pairs, functions are
thought of just in terms of their correlating arguments with values. A
function, as it is understood in categorial grammar has more structure
than this. This is an interesting generalization of the notion of a
function as it is used in logic. We can see that it also has important
links to the concept of a propositional function, especially as it is
used in Montague semantics.</p>

<p>
In categorial grammar we can attribute more than one type to a single
expression in a language. Let us call this the <strong>principle of
multiple types</strong>. Here is an example due to Mark Steadman.
Consider the sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I dislike, and Mary enjoys, musicals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The transitive verbs &lsquo;dislike&rsquo; and &lsquo;enjoys&rsquo;
have the type (NP\S)/NP, that is, they take a noun phrase on their
right and return a verb phrase. But in the case of &lsquo;I dislike,
and Mary enjoys musicals&rsquo; the verbs are separated from their
object and joined to their objects. Steadman deals with this by
raising the type of the subjects &lsquo;I&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Mary&rsquo;. Usually, we treat these words as having the type
NP, but here they have the type S/(NP\S). This is the type of an
expression that takes a verb phrase on its right and returns a
sentence. Steadman then uses a rule that makes the backslash
transitive and derives that &lsquo;I.dislike&rsquo; has the type S/NP,
which takes a noun phrase (such as &lsquo;musicals&rsquo;) on its
right an returns a sentence.</p>

<p>
We can see that the principle of multiple types also holds if analyze
sentences other type theories, such as the simple theory of types. For
consider the sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Mary eats a hamburger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In interpreting this sentence we can take &lsquo;Mary&rsquo; to be of
type \(i\), but we can also take it to be of type \(\langle \langle i
\rangle \rangle\), that is, the type of a propositional function on
propositional functions of individuals. We can also raise the type of
&lsquo;eats a hamburger&rsquo; to \(\langle \langle \langle i \rangle
\rangle \rangle\), a propositional function on propositional functions
on propositional functions on individuals. And so on. The principle of
multiple types and the principle of multiple analyses together show
that a single expression or sentence can be interpreted as having a
very large number of logical forms.</p>

<h2 id="Con">13. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This brief history of propositional functions shows that they are
useful entities and that they have played a central role in logic as
it is used in philosophy and linguistics. The entry has omitted the
more mathematical uses of propositional functions, for example, in
Russell&rsquo;s and Ramsey&rsquo;s constructions of classes, in Paul
Halmos&rsquo;s polyadic algeba, and in Leon Henkin&rsquo;s general
models for higher-order logic. But the topic of propositional
functions is a big one and we can&rsquo;t cover it all in a single
encyclopedia article.</p>

functions plays an important role in dealing with paradoxes concerning
propositional attitude reports &ndash; i.e., statements about what
people believe, think, deny, etc.)</li>
