<h1>Comparative Philosophy of Religion</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Mar 19, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Comparative philosophy of religion is a subfield of both philosophy of
religion and comparative philosophy. Philosophy of religion engages
with philosophical questions related to religious belief and practice,
including questions concerning the concept of religion itself.
Comparative philosophy compares concepts, theories, and arguments from
diverse philosophical traditions. The term &ldquo;comparative
philosophy of religion&rdquo; can refer to the comparative
philosophical study of different religions or of different
philosophies of religion. It can thus be either a first-order
philosophical discipline&mdash;investigating matters to do with
religion&mdash;or a second-order philosophical discipline,
investigating matters to do with philosophical inquiry into religion.
When understood in the latter sense, comparative philosophy of
religion is a form of metaphilosophy.</p>

<p>
Following the famous dictum from Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller (who was
himself borrowing a phrase from Goethe), it may be claimed that, in
the study of religion, someone &ldquo;<em>who knows one, knows
none</em>&rdquo; (M&uuml;ller 1882: 13, original emphasis). By this,
M&uuml;ller meant not that it is impossible to have a deep practical
knowledge of a religion (such as a religion to which one is personally
committed) without knowing about other religions; rather, his point is
that one cannot come to know &ldquo;what religion really is&rdquo; if
one has knowledge of only one (1882: 13). In other words, without
comparison, one will not be able to take a step back from the specific
instance and gain a perspective on the phenomenon of religion more
generally. Applying this thought to philosophy of religion, it might
be contended that if a philosophical understanding of
<em>religion</em> (in general) is to be arrived at, rather than of
only one religion, the method must involve comparison. Hence, just as
it has been asserted by some that &ldquo;All philosophy is comparative
philosophy&rdquo; (Allinson 2001: 270; see also Masson-Oursel 1951),
so it might be argued that all philosophy of religion&mdash;or, at any
rate, all <em>good</em> philosophy of religion&mdash;has a comparative
element (Ruparell 2011: 45).</p>

<p>
The present entry surveys different ways of understanding both the
term &ldquo;comparative philosophy of religion&rdquo; and other terms
that have been used to designate the same or similar fields of study.
It also examines historical examples of comparative philosophy of
religion, from ancient to modern times, along with competing
approaches to this form of inquiry, some of which accentuate unity
while others accentuate diversity. Then, after considering a selection
of philosophically comparative studies of specific religious topics,
the entry ends with some reflections upon challenges for the field,
both methodological and political.</p>

<h2 id="ComPhiRelComTer">1. &ldquo;Comparative Philosophy of Religion&rdquo; and Comparable Terms</h2>

<h3 id="MeaComPhiRel">1.1 Meanings of &ldquo;Comparative Philosophy of Religion&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Comparative philosophy of religion&rdquo; has two main
meanings. On the one hand, it can denote the comparative philosophical
study of two or more religions. This meaning is typified by Franklin
Gamwell when he defines comparative philosophy of religion as
&ldquo;critical reflection that asks: What most general understandings
of the similarities and differences among religious activities are
valid?&rdquo; or, more succinctly, &ldquo;What are the most general
similarities and differences among religions?&rdquo; (Gamwell 1994:
22). On the other hand, the term can denote the comparative study of
two or more <em>philosophies</em> of religion. Timothy Knepper, for
instance, compares what he calls &ldquo;traditions of philosophy of
religion,&rdquo; under which heading he includes, as representative
examples, East Asian, South Asian, Mediterranean/Abrahamic, African,
Indigenous American, and European/Academic philosophies of religion
(Knepper 2023: 15).</p>

<p>
Since the distinction between a religion, or a religious idea, and a
philosophy of religion, or a philosophical idea about religion, is not
always sharp, there will be occasions when there is a merging of the
two meanings of &ldquo;comparative philosophy of religion&rdquo; that
have just been outlined. As Victoria Harrison remarks, &ldquo;the
global philosophical project &hellip; will inevitably involve the
practitioner with religious ideas simply because the world&rsquo;s
philosophical traditions are permeated with them&rdquo; (2020: 29).
If, for example, one were to compare the ideas of &#346;a&#7749;kara
(<em>c.</em> 8th century CE) with those of Thomas Aquinas
(1225&ndash;1274 CE)&mdash;as some scholars have done (e.g.,
Willman-Grabowska 1938; Smet 2013)&mdash;would one be comparing
religious ideas or philosophical ones? The answer is apt to depend on
exactly which ideas one is concerned with. On the face of it, however,
there is unlikely to be only one answer, for both &#346;a&#7749;kara
and Aquinas are commonly regarded as religious as well as
philosophical thinkers. Furthermore, some would argue that the very
distinction between religion and philosophy is a product of European
modernity (e.g., Howard 1996; King 1999: 4&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
In principle, comparative philosophy of religion could involve
comparing ideas from two or more philosophical or religious thinkers
from within the same cultural tradition. For example, the views of
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (870&ndash;950 CE) on the relation between
reason and revelation might be compared or contrasted with those of
Ibn Rushd (1126&ndash;1198 CE) (see, e.g., Kurmanaliyeva 2021), even
though each of these thinkers belongs to the tradition of Islamic
philosophical theology. More often, however, comparative philosophy of
religion compares ideas from thinkers or schools of thought located in
different traditions. For this reason, the terms &ldquo;cross-cultural
philosophy of religion&rdquo; (Clayton 2006; Maharaj 2018) or
&ldquo;intercultural philosophy of religion&rdquo; (Garsdal 2012;
Mosima 2022) are sometimes used in place of &ldquo;comparative
philosophy of religion.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="DesNorApp">1.2 Descriptive and Normative Approaches</h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;cross-cultural philosophy of religion&rdquo; has
occasionally been preferred to &ldquo;comparative philosophy of
religion&rdquo; on the grounds that &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; has
become associated with a &ldquo;descriptive or phenomenological
approach&rdquo; whereas cross-cultural philosophy of religion is a
normative enterprise that seeks to evaluate the truth-claims of
various religions (Dean 1995: 3&ndash;4). Although there is indeed a
notable divergence between approaches that emphasize description and
classification, on the one hand, and those that emphasize normative
evaluation and construction, on the other, it would be misleading to
assume that the terms &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cross-cultural&rdquo; are used universally to designate these
respective approaches. Some philosophers of religion readily embrace
the term &ldquo;comparative philosophy of religion&rdquo; while
nonetheless regarding philosophy as being necessarily concerned with
&ldquo;evaluative questions of meaning, truth, and value&rdquo;
(Knepper 2017: 1&ndash;2; see also Braak 2020: 21).</p>

<h3 id="DiaRatThaCom">1.3 Dialogue Rather than Comparison?</h3>

<p>
Some works of comparative philosophy of religion are composed in
explicitly dialogical form (see 2.2 below). Even when the style of
textual composition is not dialogical, however, works of comparative
philosophy of religion may be regarded as dialogical in an extended
sense of the term. Gamwell describes comparative philosophy of
religion as &ldquo;interreligious dialogue that has become critical
reflection&rdquo; (1994: 21); as he sees it, the comparative
enterprise involves bringing different religious voices into implicit
dialogue with one another and critically reflecting upon their
similarities and differences (22). John Clayton, following Wilhelm
Halbfass, understands his own comparative exercises as the pursuit of
&ldquo;dialogic comparison by constructing imaginary conversations
between major thinkers&rdquo; (Clayton 2006: 102; compare Halbfass
1997: 307). For both Halbfass and Clayton, these imagined
conversations are &ldquo;between major thinkers of the European and
Indian traditions&rdquo; (Clayton 2006: 102), but in principle they
could be between thinkers from any place or time.</p>

<p>
Raimundo Panikkar preferred the term &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; to
&ldquo;comparison&rdquo; because he held that &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;
implies, <em>per impossibile</em>, adopting a detached and neutral
standpoint from which to observe and evaluate the merits of two or
more positions (1980: 357, 358). Panikkar&rsquo;s favoured image is
that of an &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; between dialogue partners, who meet
one another on an equal footing (1999: 26). If the exchange of ideas
proceeds in terms of reasons and arguments, then Panikkar calls this
&ldquo;dialectical dialogue&rdquo;; if it takes a more directly
interpersonal form&mdash;getting to know the other as a
&ldquo;you&rdquo;&mdash;then Panikkar calls it &ldquo;dialogical
dialogue&rdquo; (ibid.). Even if it remains difficult to transfer this
model of verbal interaction to the written page, its emphasis on
mutual understanding and reciprocal progress towards a shared
goal&mdash;without simply glossing over genuine
differences&mdash;evokes a sensibility that authors such as Halbfass
and Clayton have sought to
 emulate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="ComPhiRelHisPer">2. Comparative Philosophy of Religion in Historical Perspective</h2>

<h3 id="EarSou">2.1 Early Sources</h3>

<p>
How far back we should assign the origins of the branch of philosophy
known as &ldquo;philosophy of religion&rdquo; is a contested matter.
As some have observed, philosophical arguments and speculations
relevant to religion are traceable to the earliest known Western
philosophers in ancient Greece (Oppy and Trakakis 2009). Similar
claims have been made about other ancient traditions, such as those of
India and China, where the origins of philosophy were bound up with
methods of &ldquo;self-cultivation,&rdquo; as indeed they were in
ancient Greece and Rome (Gowans 2021; Machek 2024). There are thus
good reasons for regarding philosophy of religion as having emerged
alongside, or as part of, philosophy tout court.</p>

<p>
So, too, are there good reasons for viewing philosophy of religion as
having had a comparative dimension from ancient times onwards. We see
this in, for example, early doxographies in ancient Greece and Rome. A
doxography is a text that provides an overview of the key doctrines or
tenets of one or more philosophers, thinkers, or schools of
 thought.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 In addition to ancient Greek and Roman sources, doxographies are also
available from medieval India, compiled by figures in the Brahmanical,
Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Given the fluidity between philosophy
and religion in the ancient and medieval periods, both the Greco-Roman
and the Indian doxographies commonly amount to works of comparative
philosophy of religion. They typically place divergent views in
juxtaposition to one another, often in a partisan way&mdash;for
example, ranking systems of thought on a scale from least to most
credible&mdash;but sometimes in ways that are designed simply to
highlight salient similarities and differences. One illustrative
example from the ancient Greco-Roman world is Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De
Natura Deorum</em> (&ldquo;On the Nature of the Gods,&rdquo; 45 BCE),
which takes the form of a dialogue between representatives of
Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Academic Scepticism on theological and
related topics (Cicero <em>DND</em>). A further example is
<em>Stromateis</em> (&ldquo;Patchworks,&rdquo; <em>c.</em> late 2nd to
early 3rd centuries CE), attributed to Clement of Alexandria, which
lays out several Christian themes (faith, marriage, martyrdom,
God&rsquo;s ineffability, sin, the nature of Christ) while contrasting
Christian views with those of Greek philosophers, poets, and other
writers (Clement of Alexandria <em>S</em>).</p>

<p>
Indian doxographies include
<em>Madhyamaka-h&#7771;daya-k&#257;rik&#257;</em> (&ldquo;Verses on
the Heart of the Middle Way&rdquo;) by the M&#257;dhyamika Buddhist
Bh&#257;viveka (8th century CE);
<em>&#7778;a&#7693;-dar&#347;ana-samuccaya</em> (&ldquo;Collection of
the Six Views&rdquo;) by the Jain philosopher-monk Haribhadra (8th
century CE); and <em>Sarva-siddh&#257;nta-sa&#7747;graha</em>
(&ldquo;Compilation of All Philosophical Conclusions,&rdquo;
<em>c.</em> 10th&ndash;14th centuries CE) by a representative of the
Advaita Ved&#257;nta school who has been traditionally, albeit almost
certainly apocryphally, identified as &#346;a&#7749;kara (see, e.g.,
Ra&#7749;g&#257;c&#257;rya 1909). Despite structural, stylistic, and
sectarian differences between these texts, it has been argued by
certain interpreters that they share a driving soteriological purpose:
readers are &ldquo;trained to elevate [their] view, through a
systematic dialogue with competing opinions,&rdquo; and to thereby
make progress towards a liberated state of wisdom (Bouthillette 2020:
21).</p>

<h3 id="DiaFor">2.2 The Dialogue Form</h3>

<p>
Composing texts in dialogue form has been a prevalent means of
undertaking comparisons in both European and Indian philosophical
traditions, for dialogues enable different philosophical or religious
viewpoints to be juxtaposed with one another. An example from ancient
India is the dialogue depicted in the
<em>B&#7771;had&#257;ra&#7751;yaka</em> <em>Upani&#7779;ad</em>
(<em>c</em>. 8th century BCE) between the female sage G&#257;rg&#299;
and the male sage Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya. G&#257;rg&#299; pushes her
questioning about the foundation of the universe so far that
Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya ends the discussion by telling her that if she
asks too many questions, her &ldquo;head will shatter apart!&rdquo;
(Olivelle 1996: 40). Further examples featuring characters that embody
different viewpoints or social positions include the respective
dialogues between a Brahmin named So&#7751;ada&#7751;&#7693;a and the
Buddha in the Buddhist <em>D&#299;gha</em> <em>Nik&#257;ya</em>
(<em>c</em>. 1st century BCE) and between a king named Janaka and a
female ascetic named Sulabh&#257; in the Brahmanical epic
<em>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</em> (<em>c</em>. 4th century BCE to
<em>c</em>. 4th century CE). In the first of these, the Buddha
convinces So&#7751;ada&#7751;&#7693;a that morality and wisdom rather
than caste status are the essential qualities of a Brahmin (Shulman
2017: 379); in the second, Sulabh&#257; argues that spiritual
liberation can be attained only through renunciation and that, for
this reason, a king cannot be liberated (Black 2015).</p>

<p>
A distinction may be made between didactic forms of dialogue, whose
purpose is to show the superiority of the position of one of the
interlocutors, and contemplative or impartial dialogues, which are
more even-handed in their presentation of the competing positions.
Instances of the didactic variety include some of the dialogues by
Plato, such as <em>Phaedo</em> and <em>Republic</em>, in which the
character Socrates appears to be &ldquo;a Platonic mouthpiece&rdquo;
(Morgan 1992: 233); other characters act as foils, whose questions are
responded to by Socrates and whose counterclaims serve only to show
the more compelling force of Socrates&rsquo; arguments. Instances of
contemplative dialogues include Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De Natura
Deorum</em> (mentioned in 2.1 above), the style of which influenced
David Hume&rsquo;s <em>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</em>
(1779; see 2.3 and 5.3 below). Clayton characterizes this
contemplative style as &ldquo;a kind of invitation to a conversation
that is projected beyond the text at hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;an invitation
to participate in a process of philosophizing&rdquo; (Clayton 2006:
104).</p>

<h3 id="ModEurComPhiRel">2.3 Modern European Comparative Philosophy of Religion</h3>

<p>
David Tracy has argued that the figures who are primarily responsible
for giving rise to philosophy of religion &ldquo;as an autonomous and
modern discipline&rdquo; are David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F.
Hegel in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and that each
of these three figures pursued a fundamentally comparative approach
(Tracy 1990:
 12&ndash;13).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 In the case of Hume, the comparative method is explicit in his
<em>The Natural History of Religion</em> (1757 [1956]) and implicit in
the dialogical form of his <em>Dialogues Concerning Natural
Religion</em> (1779) (Tracy 1990: 19). The purpose of the former of
these works is to show that religion has its origins not in reason but
in human nature, with its hopes and fears. In developing the argument,
Hume examines different types of polytheistic and monotheistic
religion, formulating an evolutionary theory of how, notwithstanding
some toing and froing between the two, monotheism superseded
polytheism. The <em>Dialogues</em>, by contrast, examine reasons for
and against holding a belief in God, with a particular focus on
arguments that have come to be known as &ldquo;teleological&rdquo; or
&ldquo;design&rdquo; arguments. By giving voice to divergent
viewpoints through invented characters, Hume brings the
particularities of each position into relief.</p>

<p>
In the case of Kant, Tracy points to several factors that indicate his
&ldquo;interest in comparativist issues&rdquo;: these include
Kant&rsquo;s lectures on Eastern religions; his curiosity with reports
by travellers and explorers; remarks in his <em>Opus postumum</em>
(<em>OP</em>) on Zoroaster and Job; and &ldquo;his insistence, in
<em>Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone</em> [1792], that his
philosophical analysis of religion applied not only to Christianity
but to all the religions&rdquo; (Tracy 1990: 19). Tracy admits,
however, that Kant&rsquo;s principal concern in the latter work is to
provide a &ldquo;philosophical elucidation of the Christian
religion&rdquo; (1990: 21), a concern that restricts the scope of
Kant&rsquo;s comparative interests.</p>

<p>
Hegel, too, gives pride of place to Christianity, &ldquo;The
Consummate Religion&rdquo; (<em>Die vollendete Religion</em>) (Hegel
<em>LPR</em>: Part 3). For Hegel (as paraphrased by Thomas Lewis),
&ldquo;The consummate religion is the one in which religion&rsquo;s
object is not simply the object itself, &lsquo;God,&rsquo; but also
the consciousness of this object&rdquo;&mdash;and Hegel maintains that
it is in Christianity that &ldquo;God and consciousness of God&rdquo;
are unified (Lewis 2011: 205). Hegel&rsquo;s comparative analysis of
religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism, along with the
religions of China, ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, occurs in Part 2
of his <em>Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</em>, in which he
devises a typology of &ldquo;Determinate Religion&rdquo;
(<em>LPR</em>: Part 2). As Tracy contends, &ldquo;at his elucidatory
best,&rdquo; Hegel was at the forefront of &ldquo;developing a
comparative hermeneutics of the historical religions&rdquo; (Tracy
1990: 25). At the same time, however, Hegel was prone to ignore such
factors as &ldquo;historical context,&rdquo; &ldquo;internal
developments and differences in distinct strands of a religious
tradition,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the religions as living religions&rdquo;
(Tracy 1990: 25). Thus, although Hegel was a pioneer in comparative
philosophy of religion, he left room for improvement in his methods of
analysis.</p>

<h3 id="TweTweFirCenDev">2.4 Twentieth- and Twenty-First-Century Developments</h3>

<p>
Influential figures in comparative philosophy of religion from the
twentieth century onwards&mdash;even if not all of them would identify
primarily as philosophers&mdash;include Nishida Kitar&#333;
(1870&ndash;1945), Sri Aurobindo (1872&ndash;1950), Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan (1888&ndash;1975), Wilfred Cantwell Smith
(1916&ndash;2000), Raimundo (aka Raimon) Panikkar (1918&ndash;2010),
John Hick (1922&ndash;2012), Ninian Smart (1927&ndash;2001), Keith
Ward (b. 1938), Robert Cummings Neville (b. 1939), and Arvind Sharma
(b. 1940). For reasons of space, the exposition here will focus on
Nishida, Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan, and Smart, who together represent a
diversity of approaches. (For more on Panikkar, see 1.3 above; for
more on Hick, see 3.3 below.)</p>

<p>
Nishida was an independently minded Japanese philosopher who drew upon
ideas from both Western and Asian philosophical and religious sources.
Regarding religion as &ldquo;the ultimate view of the world and the
most important question&rdquo; (quoted in Yusa 1987: 63), Nishida
developed a philosophy of religion that, while invoking Christian and
Buddhist ideas, is not reducible to one tradition or the other. Key
themes for Nishida include the notions of &ldquo;absolute
nothingness&rdquo; and the &ldquo;absolute present,&rdquo; each of
which is connected with what Nishida understood the Zen Buddhist state
of enlightenment or &ldquo;seeing one&rsquo;s nature&rdquo;
(<em>kensh&#333;</em>) to consist in (Nishida 1945 [1987: 108]).
Although, for Nishida, religion amounts to the human quest for eternal
life, he maintained that eternity is to be found not in a state of
existence after death, but in the durationless present instant.
Borrowing imagery from Christian theologians such as Nicholas of Cusa,
Nishida describes this &ldquo;eternal present&rdquo; as an infinite
circle or sphere: because it &ldquo;has no circumference, every point,
every act of consciousness, is a center radiating in infinity&rdquo;
(Nishida 1945 [1987: 53&ndash;54]). Having been one of the main
founders of the Ky&#333;to School of philosophy, Nishida has inspired
subsequent generations of Japanese philosophers, some of whom, such as
Abe Masao (1915&ndash;2006) and Ueda Shizuteru (1926&ndash;2019), have
themselves made significant contributions to comparative philosophy of
religion and Buddhist-Christian dialogue (see, e.g., Mitchell 1998;
Davis 2022).</p>

<p>
Aurobindo Ghose, better known as Sri Aurobindo, was a visionary
philosopher for whom the integration of what he viewed as the
materialistic tendencies of Western thought and the spiritual
tendencies of Asian, especially Indian, thought was central to his
philosophical project. He developed a conception of spiritual
discipline that he termed &ldquo;integral Yoga,&rdquo; which he
regarded as a synthesis of the various systems of yoga that have been
advanced in India over many centuries (Aurobindo 1999: chap. 5). This
discipline is &ldquo;integral&rdquo; insofar as its aim is to
integrate the bodily, mental, and divine aspects of one&rsquo;s life,
and &ldquo;to liberate them into their highest possibilities&rdquo;
(1999: 19). Aurobindo&rsquo;s philosophy has frequently been termed
&ldquo;integral philosophy&rdquo; (e.g., Banerjee 2012; Prince 2017)
since it, too, seeks to integrate elements from diverse sources. His
facility with Western as well as Indian philosophical and religious
ideas enables Aurobindo to draw upon both in formulating his own
constructive vision; for example, he identifies the concept of
&ldquo;Supreme Brahman&rdquo; with &ldquo;that which in Western
metaphysics is called the Absolute&rdquo; (Aurobindo 2005: 338).
Aurobindo conceived of philosophy as a spiritual discipline, &ldquo;an
effort at inner perfection of the being&rdquo; (2005: 912). In common
with later thinkers such as Pierre Hadot (1995), he views this
spiritual orientation as being present in ancient Greek and Roman
schools of philosophy (such as the Pythagorean, Stoic, and Epicurean
schools), as well as in certain strands of &ldquo;later Christian or
Neo-pagan&rdquo; thought; but, again like Hadot, he regards this
orientation as having been lost in modern Western philosophy, wherein
&ldquo;the spiritual urge and the intellectual reason&rdquo; have
largely &ldquo;parted company&rdquo; (Aurobindo 2005: 912). For this
reason, Aurobindo accentuates the benefits of a &ldquo;fusion&rdquo;
between &ldquo;the old Eastern and the new Western knowledge&rdquo; as
a means of investigating how that which is eternal and infinite gives
rise to, or manifests as, time and space (2005: 122).</p>

<p>
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was both a philosopher and a politician.
Among other positions, he held the Spalding Chair of Eastern Religion
and Ethics at the University of Oxford from 1936 to 1952 and was
President of India from 1962 to 1967. His interest in comparative
philosophy and religion is evident from the titles of some of his
books, such as <em>East and West in Religion</em> (1933), <em>Eastern
Religions and Western Thought</em> (1939), and <em>East and West: Some
Reflections</em> (1955). Radhakrishnan&rsquo;s view of religion is
comparable to the later religious pluralism of John Hick (3.3 below).
&ldquo;Religious experience is not the pure unvarnished presentment of
the real in itself,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;but is the presentment of
the real already influenced by the ideas and presuppositions of the
perceiving mind&rdquo; (Radhakrishnan 1927: 24). In some places,
Radhakrishnan, like Hick, implies that all religions&mdash;or all the
major ones&mdash;are on an equal footing when it comes to
conceptualizing reality or the divine truth: &ldquo;While all
traditions are of value, none is finally binding&rdquo; (Radhakrishnan
1937: 120). Elsewhere, he gives pride of place to the Hindu
philosophical school of Advaita Ved&#257;nta, which, he claims,
&ldquo;is not a religion, but religion itself in its most universal
and deepest significance&rdquo; (1927: 23). The &ldquo;idealist view
of life,&rdquo; of which Advaita Ved&#257;nta is a paradigm case, has,
however, taken many forms in different times and places&mdash;forms
which, despite their &ldquo;variations and oppositions,&rdquo; share
&ldquo;the same spirit&rdquo; (1937: 16). Radhakrishnan was a strong
advocate of cooperation between Western and Asian societies in both
the practical and the intellectual domains. &ldquo;The separation of
East and West is over,&rdquo; he wrote in 1955, &ldquo;The history of
the new world, the one world, has begun. It promises to be large in
extent, varied in colour, rich in quality&rdquo; (1955: 131).</p>

<p>
Ninian Smart was a major figure in twentieth-century philosophy of
religion and in the study of religions more broadly. His approach was
comparative from the outset; for example, his first book was a
comparative study of Christian and non-Christian discourse (1958), and
his second takes the form of an imagined conversation between six
representatives of different religious traditions: a Jew, a Christian,
a Muslim, a Hindu, a Sri Lankan Therav&#257;da Buddhist, and a
Japanese Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhist (Smart 1960). Smart held that
&ldquo;philosophers of religion &hellip; cannot ignore the comparative
study of religions&rdquo; because seeking the truth of religion
requires comparing the reasons for favouring one purported revelation
over others (1960: 11). Smart&rsquo;s notable contributions to
comparative philosophy of religion include his phenomenological
method, his multidimensional analysis of &ldquo;the sacred,&rdquo; and
his expansive notion of a philosophy of <em>worldviews</em>.
Notwithstanding Smart&rsquo;s concern with religious truth in some of
his works, his phenomenological method, adapted from the earlier
phenomenological tradition of Edmund Husserl and others, involves
&ldquo;bracketing&rdquo; questions of truth while describing religious
phenomena in sufficient depth to convey &ldquo;what it is
<em>like</em>&rdquo; to participate in religious activities (Smart
1973: 33, 75). Such a method, Smart maintains, has the potential to
facilitate widening the scope of philosophy of religion; by
&ldquo;stepping back&rdquo; from any specific religious commitment,
the phenomenologist may describe and compare multiple religions (1973:
7). Smart&rsquo;s multidimensional analysis goes beyond a fixation on
theoretical or doctrinal aspects of religion, taking account also of
other &ldquo;dimensions of the sacred&rdquo; (1996), such as the
ritual, mythic, experiential, ethical, social, artistic, and political
dimensions. Religions may be compared in relation to each of these
(and other) dimensions. Finally, Smart&rsquo;s promotion of the study
of worldviews encourages the comparative investigation of human
systems of belief and practice in general, including those such as
nationalism and secular humanism, rather than focusing solely on
religions (Smart 1981, 2000). This approach of Smart&rsquo;s is one
that continues to be developed further by others (e.g., Davies 2022;
Stenmark 2022); it is also becoming increasingly popular in
educational settings (see O&rsquo;Grady 2022).</p>

<p>
In addition to specific authors such as those mentioned above, it
should be noted that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have
also produced eminent events, projects, journals, and book series that
have made substantial contributions to comparative philosophy of
religion. Notable events include the series of East&ndash;West
Philosophers&rsquo; Conferences sponsored by the Department of
Philosophy at the University of Hawai&lsquo;i, beginning in 1939. Out
of this series grew the journal <em>Philosophy East and West</em>,
founded in 1951. Although the focus of the journal is not specifically
religion, many of its articles will be of interest to philosophers of
religion.</p>

<p>
In the 1990s and in 2001, two book series in comparative philosophy of
religion were published by State University of New York Press. The
first series, titled &ldquo;Toward a Comparative Philosophy of
Religions,&rdquo; was led by Frank Reynolds and David Tracy of the
University of Chicago Divinity School; it produced four edited volumes
and nine single-authored monographs between 1990 and 1999. The second
series was titled &ldquo;The Comparative Religious Ideas
Project.&rdquo; Based at Boston University, the project produced three
mutually complementary volumes in 2001, edited by Robert Neville
(2001a,b,c).</p>

<p>
Since 2012, the Comparison Project based at Drake University, Des
Moines, Iowa, has hosted series of lectures and conferences in which
different religious and philosophical perspectives are offered on
issues of religious importance. Publications produced by the project
include edited volumes on ineffability (Knepper and Kalmanson 2017),
death and dying (Knepper, Bregman, and Gottschalk 2019), miracles
(Zwier, Weddle, and Knepper 2022), and mysticism (Weed 2023).</p>

<p>
From 2020 to 2023, the Global Philosophy of Religion Project, funded
by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation, was led by Yujin
Nagasawa at the University of Birmingham, UK. Outputs included special
journal issues, videos, and a major open-access edited volume titled
<em>Global Dialogues in the Philosophy of Religion</em> (Nagasawa and
Zarepour 2024).</p>

<p>
Besides <em>Philosophy East and West</em>, other relevant journals
include <em>Sophia: International Journal of Philosophy and
Traditions</em> (founded in 1962), <em>Dao: A Journal of Comparative
Philosophy</em> (founded in 2001), and <em>Comparative and Continental
Philosophy</em> (founded in 2009), as well as the various journals
that specialize in philosophy of religion.</p>

<h2 id="SynAppCom">3. Synthesizing Approaches to Comparison</h2>

<p>
A broad distinction can be drawn between two different orientations in
comparative philosophy of religion. On the one hand are synthesizing
approaches, which emphasize similarities between religious or
religiously relevant philosophical ideas that derive from distinct
traditions. On the other hand, there are heterogenizing approaches,
which emphasize dissimilarities between such ideas. Although the
differences between these alternative orientations are indeed largely
a matter of emphasis, their respective emphases are often correlated
with specific methodological preferences and
 aspirations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 This and the next section give representative examples to illustrate
the two orientations in question.</p>

<h3 id="ArtSch">3.1 Arthur Schopenhauer</h3>

<p>
The work of Schopenhauer (1788&ndash;1860) exemplifies a synthesizing
approach to comparative philosophy of religion inasmuch as it draws
upon ideas and doctrines from various religious and philosophical
traditions&mdash;most notably Platonism, Kantian idealism, Indian
Ved&#257;nta, and Buddhism&mdash;for the purpose of developing or
augmenting what Schopenhauer describes as his own
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; system of thought (1818 [1969: xii]).
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s philosophical productiveness flourished at a
time&mdash;the early nineteenth century&mdash;when many texts from
Asia, especially India, were reaching European readers for the first
time; the efforts of translators and philologists were generating what
came to be known as the &ldquo;Oriental Renaissance&rdquo; (Schwab
1950). Schopenhauer especially admired the ancient Indian scriptures
known as the Upani&#7779;ads, which he read in a Latin translation
(which was itself rendered from a Persian edition rather than from the
original Sanskrit); this edition, he declared, &ldquo;has been the
consolation of my life and will be that of my death&rdquo; (1851
[1974:
 397]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
While incorporating references to Buddhist, Ved&#257;ntic, Platonic,
and Kantian sources into his work, Schopenhauer viewed his own
philosophical contribution as going beyond or perfecting those
sources. For example, despite concurring with Buddhist and
Ved&#257;ntic injunctions to renounce attachments and cultivate a
desireless state of mind, Schopenhauer thought that proponents of
these philosophies remained too attached to the promise of a positive
state beyond renunciation: they were prone to fool themselves with
&ldquo;meaningless words, such as reabsorption in <em>Brahman</em>, or
the <em>Nirvana</em> of the Buddhists,&rdquo; whereas, for
Schopenhauer, we should not be afraid to affirm that &ldquo;the final
goal&rdquo; is &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; (1818 [1969: 411]). Thus,
Schopenhauer was not an uncritical appropriator of his sources: he was
a constructive metaphysician who was pioneering in his openness to
religious and philosophical ideas from outside his own
nineteenth-century Germanic context.</p>

<h3 id="PerPhi">3.2 Perennial Philosophy</h3>

<p>
The term <em>philosophia perennis</em>, &ldquo;perennial
philosophy,&rdquo; is often assumed to have been &ldquo;coined by
Leibniz&rdquo; (Huxley 1945 [1947: 1]; Bilimoria 2003: 360 n. 1).
Although Leibniz does speak of <em>perennis quaedam Philosophia</em>
(&ldquo;a certain perennial philosophy&rdquo;) in a letter to
Nicolas-Fran&ccedil;ois R&eacute;mond in 1714 (Leibniz <em>PS</em>:
625), the term goes back at least as far as the Italian humanist
theologian Agostino Steuco (1497&ndash;1548), who published a treatise
titled <em>De perenni philosophia</em> in 1540 (Schmitt 1966:
506&ndash;507). From the early twentieth century onwards, proponents
of the idea of a perennial philosophy (or &ldquo;perennialists,&rdquo;
for short) have maintained that multiple philosophies and religions
share a common core of doctrines that are grounded in a transcultural
religious or mystical experience. Aldous Huxley, for example,
characterized the perennial philosophy in terms of its metaphysical,
psychological, and ethical components. Metaphysically, there is a
&ldquo;divine Reality&rdquo; underlying all things; psychologically,
there is a component of the soul that is at least similar and perhaps
identical to that divine Reality; and ethically&mdash;or, we might
say, soteriologically&mdash;the goal of life is to achieve knowledge
of the Reality or &ldquo;Ground of all being,&rdquo; which is
simultaneously transcendent and immanent (Huxley 1945 [1947: 1]).
Together, these components constitute the &ldquo;Highest Common
Factor&rdquo; at the heart of all theologies (ibid.).</p>

<p>
Any attempt to substantiate the claim that ostensibly diverse
religions, philosophies, or theologies in fact share common teachings
or are simply different paths to the same destination inevitably
requires comparative inquiry. Huxley quotes passages from sources as
varied as the Christian mystics Meister Eckhart and William Law, the
Brahmanical <em>Ch&#257;ndogya</em> <em>Upani&#7779;ad</em> and
<em>Vivekac&#363;&#7693;&#257;ma&#7751;i</em>, the Daoist Zhuangzi,
and the Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhist
<em>La&#7749;k&#257;vat&#257;ra</em> <em>S&#363;tra</em> (Huxley 1945
[1947: 8&ndash;14]). While admitting that differences of doctrine
obtain between these sources, Huxley&rsquo;s approach is to minimize
the differences by seeking interpretations that accentuate
commonalities. For example, in the case of the apparent divergence
between Hindu affirmations of an eternal self (<em>&#257;tman</em>)
and Buddhist denials of any such self, Huxley proposes that these
respective positions are reconcilable by prioritizing the specifically
Advaita (nondualist) Ved&#257;nta doctrine that only the nonpersonal
or cosmic &ldquo;Self&rdquo; is eternal and a certain understanding of
Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism according to which there is a
&ldquo;Universal Mind,&rdquo; which is comparable to the
&ldquo;Self&rdquo; of Advaita (Huxley 1945 [1947: 15&ndash;16]).</p>

<p>
Perennialism&mdash;especially under the name &ldquo;Perennial
Psychology&rdquo; (Forman 1998: 28)&mdash;remains prominent in the
study of mysticism, where it takes the form of opposition to a
competing view called contextualism. Contextualists (also termed, by
their opponents, constructivists) maintain that mystical experiences
are necessarily &ldquo;mediated&rdquo; or &ldquo;shaped&rdquo; by
concepts that mystics inherit from their cultural environment (Katz
1978: 26). In response, perennialists assert that there really is a
mystical state of consciousness that transcends conceptual mediation
and is common to multiple traditions. To identify this &ldquo;wakeful
though contentless&rdquo; state, Robert Forman coined the term
&ldquo;Pure Consciousness Event (PCE)&rdquo; (1990: 8). Both sides in
the debate engage in comparative analysis of relevant religious
sources, though Forman (1990: 28) also appeals to a purportedly
mystical experience of his own.</p>

<h3 id="RelPlu">3.3 Religious Pluralism</h3>

<p>
Following some terminology coined by Alan Race (1983), philosophical
or theological theories about religious diversity are frequently
divided into three main categories: exclusivism, inclusivism, and
 pluralism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 In brief, exclusivists hold that only one religion is the true one
that leads to salvation; inclusivists hold that only one religion is
wholly true but non-adherents of that religion may partake of enough
truth (or right action, etc.) to be saved; and pluralists hold that
there is some sense in which more than one religion is both true and
salvific. Holding any of these positions&mdash;and claiming to be
justified in holding it&mdash;presupposes some knowledge of more than
one religion. It is thus unsurprising that debates between
exclusivists, inclusivists, and pluralists typically involve
interreligious comparison. The most thoroughgoing comparativists tend
to be the religious pluralists, for developing a credible argument
that more than one religion is true and salvific requires extensive
comparative analysis.</p>

<p>
By far the best-known religious pluralist is John Hick, who argued
that, as far as metaphysical truth, soteriological efficacy, and
ethical rectitude are concerned, there is parity between all the
&ldquo;great world faiths&rdquo; (or &ldquo;great world
religions&rdquo;) (e.g., Hick 2010: 153; Hick 2004: xxxiii et passim).
For Hick, the latter category includes Hindu, Buddhist, Christian,
Jewish, and Muslim traditions; he also occasionally mentions other
traditions, such as Daoism, Confucianism, and Sikhism (e.g., 2004: 2,
39). He draws a broad distinction between these &ldquo;great&rdquo;
traditions, on the one hand, and the various forms of
&ldquo;archaic&rdquo; or &ldquo;primal&rdquo; religion, on the other
(2004: xiii, 23). So-called archaic religions are
&ldquo;pre-axial,&rdquo; in the sense that they are characteristic of
human religiosity prior to what Karl Jaspers dubbed the &ldquo;axis of
world history,&rdquo; which he located in the period between 800 and
200 BCE, with 500 BCE being its fulcrum (Jaspers 1953: 1). Hick
identifies small-scale indigenous religions of the present day as
being continuous with those &ldquo;archaic&rdquo; religions; instead
of being directed towards a salvific end, these remnants of pre-axial
religions are concerned merely with maintaining &ldquo;fragile human
life on an even keel&rdquo; (2004:
 23).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
According to Hick, what distinguishes the &ldquo;post-axial&rdquo; or
&ldquo;great&rdquo; traditions from the &ldquo;pre-axial&rdquo; or
&ldquo;archaic&rdquo; ones is not only their global spread but also
their soteriological ambitions: they all aim at
&ldquo;salvation/liberation/enlightenment&rdquo; (2004: xl)&mdash;a
state of ultimate human fulfilment&mdash;and they all affirm some
supreme reality. Although the names and ways of conceptualizing this
reality vary&mdash;Trinity, All&#257;h, Adonai, Brahman,
&#346;&#363;nyat&#257;&mdash;there is, Hick contends, a single
&ldquo;transcategorial (or ineffable) Real&rdquo; behind all these
conceptions (xix). Borrowing vocabulary from Kant, Hick claims that
the Real is noumenal whereas the sundry conceptions of it are
phenomenal appearances (xix). Hick&rsquo;s pluralism is thus a
synthesizing approach insofar as it prioritizes the search for a
unifying element that all the &ldquo;great&rdquo; religions have in
 common.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ProSolApp">3.4 Problem-Solving Approaches</h3>

<p>
Among the approaches to comparative philosophy of religion that are,
to some extent, responses to the kind of pluralism advocated by Hick
are what might be called <em>problem-solving approaches</em>. Yujin
Nagasawa explicitly contrasts his preferred version of global
philosophy of religion with those of Hick and Ninian Smart. Although
the latter two philosophers had sought to incorporate interreligious
perspectives into their work, they still operated with the assumption
that philosophy of religion ought to be concerned with establishing
&ldquo;the validity of particular worldviews or traditions&rdquo;
(Nagasawa 2017: 45). Nagasawa&rsquo;s alternative proposal involves a
reorientation away from the comparative evaluation of existing systems
of thought and practice, and towards collective reflection upon common
philosophical or existential problems. &ldquo;It would be
fruitful,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;if philosophers from distinct
traditions were to share their resources and tackle the common
problems together&rdquo; (2017: 45). As an example of a common
problem, Nagasawa cites the problem of evil, his thought being that
this problem might be responded to more proficiently by combining the
efforts of, among others, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, and
Buddhist philosophers than by trying to solve it from only one
religious or philosophical standpoint (46). Although there have been
instances in which a philosopher draws upon ideas from ostensibly
disparate traditions&mdash;such as Carlo Filice&rsquo;s effort to
supplement Abrahamic monotheisms with the idea of reincarnation
(Filice 2006)&mdash;what Nagasawa has in mind is something more
 collaborative.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 One way of pursuing such a collaborative venture is in the form of
dialogue, where an initial proposal is made by one philosopher and
then responded to by others, building up a multiperspectival analysis
of a given topic (see, e.g., Nagasawa and Zarepour 2024).</p>

<h2 id="HetAppCom">4. Heterogenizing Approaches to Comparison</h2>

<h3 id="IntPlu">4.1 Internalist Pluralism</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Internalist pluralism&rdquo; is a term coined by Victoria
Harrison to designate an approach to the analysis of religious
diversity that is inspired by Hilary Putnam&rsquo;s theory of internal
realism. Putnam contrasts his &ldquo;<em>internalist</em>
perspective&rdquo; with an &ldquo;<em>externalist</em>&rdquo; one
(1981: 49). The latter maintains that, first, the world is made up of
&ldquo;some fixed totality of mind-independent objects&rdquo;; second,
&ldquo;the way the world is&rdquo; is amenable to a single &ldquo;true
and complete description&rdquo;; and third, truth consists in
correspondence &ldquo;between words or thought-signs and external
things and sets of things&rdquo; (49). The internalist view, by
contrast, affirms that the question of what objects the world
comprises makes sense only within some specific &ldquo;theory of
description&rdquo; or &ldquo;conceptual scheme&rdquo; (1981: 49,
52).</p>

<p>
Applying Putnam&rsquo;s internal realism to the study of religions,
Harrison contends that if the question of what exists, or what is
real, cannot be addressed in a way that is &ldquo;conceptual-scheme
neutral,&rdquo; then the meaningful discussion of whether, or what,
&ldquo;religious realities&rdquo; exist can occur only internally to
some specific &ldquo;conceptual scheme or, what we might call, a
&lsquo;faith-stance&rsquo;&rdquo; (Harrison 2006: 292). For Harrison,
&ldquo;faith-stance&rdquo; is not a synonym of &ldquo;religion&rdquo;;
rather, any given religion may be constituted by several more-or-less
overlapping faith-stances&mdash;or, in other words, by several
more-or-less overlapping conceptual schemes (2012: 76). Nonetheless, a
deliberate consequence of Harrison&rsquo;s view is that what at first
may appear to be disagreements between distinct religions are merely
instances of members of the religions talking past one another,
because each party in the purported dispute is operating from within a
distinct conceptual scheme. Thus, for example, if a Hindu affirms that
&#346;iva is the true god, whereas a Roman Catholic denies this and
instead affirms that the true god is the Trinity of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, these competing affirmations amount to a mere difference
rather than to a genuine disagreement. From the perspective internal
to the community of worshippers of &#346;iva, it is indeed the case
that &#346;iva is the true god; and from the perspective internal to
Roman Catholicism, it is the case that the Holy Trinity is the true
god. There would be disagreement here only if the two communities
shared the same conceptual scheme, but, Harrison contends, they do not
(Harrison 2006: 293).</p>

<p>
An implication of Harrison&rsquo;s internalist pluralism for
comparative philosophy of religion is that diverse religions, or
faith-stances, may be compared, and their respective particularities
highlighted, without any insinuation being made that there is some
ultimate reality, transcendent of all conceptual schemes, to which
religious concepts and beliefs are accountable. A potential objection
might take the form of the observation that, in many cases, religious
disputes do seem to involve genuine disagreement rather than mere
differences. Even if we admit that when they affirm their respective
beliefs, the Hindu and the Christian, the Buddhist and the Muslim, are
operating with different concepts&mdash;perhaps even from within
different conceptual schemes&mdash;it remains the case that each of
them has much in common with the others: they all share a human form
of life, and that involves sharing many concepts. Further work may
thus be needed to show how, in view of this shared human framework, it
may nevertheless be the case that apparent disagreements over
religious matters are not genuine disagreements at
 all.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="RadPlu">4.2 Radical Pluralism</h3>

<p>
In the context of philosophy of religion, the term &ldquo;radical
pluralism&rdquo; has become associated principally with the
Wittgenstein-influenced philosopher D. Z. Phillips. (But see also
Bilimoria 1991; Jeanrond and Rike 1991.) In a posthumously published
essay, Phillips (2007) uses the terms &ldquo;radical pluralism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;radical plurality&rdquo; to identify both the situation in
which many people in the modern world find themselves&mdash;immersed
in cultures that exhibit a radical diversity of religious and other
ideological perspectives&mdash;and a distinctive philosophical
approach to the analysis of this condition of diversity. Like
internalist pluralism, the philosophical approach in question is
comparative and nonreductive; but unlike internalist pluralism, it
makes no claims to the effect that the various religious or
ideological perspectives constitute a set of distinct and
nonoverlapping conceptual schemes. A radical pluralist approach is
&ldquo;contemplative&rdquo; rather than metaphysical in its
aspirations, prioritizing the understanding of religious and
nonreligious points of view in their particularities instead of
seeking to establish a general theory about the nature of religion,
the truth of religious beliefs, or the efficaciousness of religious
practices.</p>

<p>
Developing Phillips&rsquo;s ideas further, Mikel Burley has combined
philosophical analysis with the use of ethnographic and literary
sources to expand the range of religions and religious phenomena to
which philosophical attention can fruitfully be given (esp. Burley
2020). While admitting that the primary purpose of the resultant
methods is to describe rather than evaluate, Burley maintains that
description can itself serve a critical function. Not only can it
bring out the complexity and diversity of phenomena that may
previously have been assumed to be largely homogeneous&mdash;thereby
disabusing us of misplaced assumptions about the phenomena in
question&mdash;but description of a variety of beliefs, practices, or
forms of life also exposes the contingency of those of oneself and
one&rsquo;s culture, calling into question the naturalness or
necessity of one&rsquo;s attitudes and
 norms.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It has also been argued that the sort of radical pluralist approach
recommended by Phillips provides a basis for the pursuit of
interreligious dialogue. According to Randy Ramal, it can supply this
basis by disclosing the &ldquo;unreflective and primal religious
reactions&rdquo; that may reasonably be regarded as giving rise to
diverse religious concepts across various religious traditions (2019:
136&ndash;137). To illustrate the point, Ramal suggests that the human
primal reaction of feeling shame at being seen naked by those other
than one&rsquo;s most intimate acquaintances may lie at the root of
certain religious attitudes towards nudity. Although significantly
different attitudes are displayed by, for example, Christians and
Digambara Jain monks, a recognition of basic human reactions may help
to overcome the tendency to see &ldquo;only incommensurability between
their different forms of life&rdquo; (Ramal 2019: 154). The overriding
goal of a radical pluralist approach is thus to draw attention to
differences where they obtain but without unduly rejecting the
possibility that common aspects of our shared humanity underlie the
plurality of expressions of religiosity.</p>

<h2 id="ComStuSpeRelIss">5. Comparative Studies of Specific Religious Issues</h2>

<p>
Comparative philosophy of religion is a potentially vast subfield of
inquiry. To illustrate its potential, there are numerous examples that
could be cited of comparative philosophy of religion being done. This
section mentions a representative sample.</p>

<h3 id="PerIdeSelDea">5.1 Personal Identity, the Self, and Death</h3>

<p>
One rich vein for religiously relevant comparative philosophical
investigation is the cluster of questions concerning personal identity
and the notion of a self. These questions often bear upon the issue of
what, if anything, persists of a human being once the physical body
has expired. A pioneering work in this connection is John Hick&rsquo;s
<em>Death and Eternal Life</em> (1976), which comprises an extensive
survey of various conceptions of death, postmortem continuation, and
what it might be that survives. The principal traditions expounded by
Hick include those of Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism, his
ambition being to advance &ldquo;a possible eschatology&rdquo; (1976:
chap. 22) in which, synthesizing elements from the diverse traditions,
he tentatively puts forward his own best estimate of what happens to
us after death. In brief, his conclusion is that some form of
reincarnation is plausible, facilitating &ldquo;moral and spiritual
growth of one and the same self through many lives&rdquo; (457), and
that this growth leads ultimately to a final life or state of being,
to which Hick is willing to apply, without any demarcation, terms such
as &ldquo;Vision of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;nirv&#257;&#7751;a,&rdquo;
&ldquo;eternal consciousness of the &#257;tman [&lsquo;self&rsquo;]
and its relation to Ultimate Reality&rdquo;
 (464).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
More recently, the potential of fruitful cross-cultural comparisons
relating to concepts of selfhood and subjectivity has been explored,
notably by specialists in Indian and Buddhist philosophy, analytic
philosophy of mind, and phenomenology. Typifying such
interdisciplinary work is the volume <em>Self, No Self?</em> (Siderits
et al. 2011), which, though not styled overtly as philosophy of
religion, nonetheless grapples with questions of profound importance
for religious practitioners. These include the question of whether, if
being conscious of something is necessarily accompanied by
self-consciousness or self-awareness, this would constitute
&ldquo;evidence for the existence of a self&rdquo; (Siderits et al.
2011: 1). Such questions quickly take us into, for example,
long-running disputes between Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophers
in the Indian and Asian context more
 broadly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ComRelEth">5.2 Comparative Religious Ethics</h3>

<p>
In a comparative study of Xunzi (third century BCE) and Augustine of
Hippo (354&ndash;430 CE), Aaron Stalnaker makes the perceptive
observation that the two most salient challenges faced by works of
comparative ethics are, first, to &ldquo;bring distant ethical
statements into interrelation and conversation,&rdquo; and second, to
&ldquo;simultaneously preserve their distinctiveness within the
interrelation&rdquo; (Stalnaker 2006: 17; see also Cline 2013: 64).
These challenges could well be said to apply to comparative
philosophy&mdash;and <em>a fortiori</em> to comparative philosophy of
religion&mdash;more generally.</p>

<p>
Comparative studies in ethics or moral philosophy frequently have
relevance to philosophy of religion, not least because, in many
religious traditions, cultivating a virtuous character or performing
morally right actions are among the means&mdash;and are sometimes the
primary means&mdash;of progressing along the spiritual path. Some
comparative works in this area identify two or more named
representatives of distinct yet comparable ethical positions. Lee
Yearley (1990), for example, provides a sustained comparative analysis
of the positions of the fourth-century Confucian philosopher Mencius
(Mengzi) and the thirteenth-century Dominican philosopher and
theologian Thomas Aquinas. With particular attention to their
respective theories of virtue and conceptions of courage,
Yearley&rsquo;s approach combines descriptive exposition with
constructive synthesis. He aims to &ldquo;chart similarities within
differences and differences within similarities&rdquo; while also
arriving at &ldquo;normative conclusions&rdquo; that emerge from the
comparison (1990: 1).</p>

<p>
A similar approach is exhibited by Asher Walden (2015), who selects
four philosophers from ostensibly disparate historical and cultural
contexts&mdash;namely, Zhu Xi (twelfth-century China), Schopenhauer
(nineteenth-century German Confederation), &#346;&#257;ntideva
(eighth-century India), and Nishida Kitar&#333; (twentieth-century
Japan)&mdash;and compares their respective responses to the question
of what justifies moral judgment. Notwithstanding the differences
between the four philosophers under examination, Walden finds in each
of them the affirmation of compassion as &ldquo;a kind of
meta-virtue&rdquo; that furnishes the &ldquo;basis for all the other
virtues&rdquo; (2015: viii). The fact that there is some degree of
confluence between philosophers from diverse times and places is, of
course, not in itself an argument for the truth of the claims that
they make, and Walden does not suppose that it is. Nevertheless, the
four-way comparative analysis deployed by Walden is one effective
means of showing how a similar solution to a problem can be arrived at
from different angles.</p>

<p>
The concept of compassion (<em>karu&#7751;&#257;</em>) also has a
prominent place in Ok-sun An&rsquo;s book-length treatment of the
relation between this concept as it occurs in early Buddhism and the
notion of benevolence (<em>jen</em> or <em>ren</em> &#20161;) in
Confucianism (An 1997). By means of interpretive exposition and
comparative analysis, An calls into question oversimplifying
assumptions, notably the assumptions that early Buddhism is solely
concerned with individual liberation from the cycle of rebirth and
that Confucianism is exclusively directed towards self-effacing
service of the social
 order.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="RelBeyRat">5.3 Religion and (or beyond) Rationality</h3>

<p>
Since philosophy is a discipline concerned in large part with giving
reasons and formulating arguments, it is little surprise that central
among the preoccupations of philosophy of religion has been the
construction or evaluation of reasons and arguments for certain
religious beliefs, typically presented in propositional
 form.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Works in comparative philosophy of religion also often involve the
comparison of arguments or &ldquo;acts of religious
reason-giving&rdquo; (Knepper 2023: 58). John Clayton (2006), for
example, undertakes a comparison of the respective arguments against
natural theology in David Hume&rsquo;s <em>Dialogues Concerning
Natural Religion</em> (1779) and R&#257;m&#257;nuja&rsquo;s eleventh-
or twelfth-century commentary on the <em>Brahma S&#363;tra</em>.
Clayton finds similarities in the reasons of these philosophers for
rejecting purported rational proofs of the existence or nature of the
divine. Through the character of Philo, Hume expresses scepticism that
any knowledge of God can be gained via inference or perceptual
experience. R&#257;m&#257;nuja, likewise, denies that Brahman is
knowable by these means; in doing so, he anticipates Hume&rsquo;s
principal objections to the &ldquo;design argument&rdquo; (Clayton
2006: 132). Unlike Hume, however, R&#257;m&#257;nuja maintains that
knowledge of Brahman is received from scripture, &ldquo;which rests on
endless unbroken tradition&rdquo; (R&#257;m&#257;nuja <em>VS</em>
[1904: 25], quoted in Clayton 2006: 111).</p>

<p>
Along with R&#257;m&#257;nuja, other philosophers who are sympathetic
to religion while denying that religious beliefs are rationally
supportable include Zhuangzi (4th century BCE) and S&oslash;ren
Kierkegaard (1813&ndash;1855). Karen Carr and Philip Ivanhoe (2000)
argue that each of these latter two philosophers, in his own way,
presents us with a form of &ldquo;antirationalism.&rdquo; By this,
Carr and Ivanhoe mean not that rationality is entirely rejected, but
that it is found to be &ldquo;not only inadequate but potentially
inimical to a proper appreciation of the truth&rdquo; (2000: 118).
While there is implicit agreement between Zhuangzi and Kierkegaard
that reason cannot lead us to ultimate truth (or salvation), the
respective &ldquo;positive prescriptions&rdquo; of these two thinkers
diverge (2000: 119). Zhuangzi proposes leaping into and harmonizing
one&rsquo;s life with the <em>dao</em>&mdash;the &ldquo;boundless
Way&rdquo; (120). Kierkegaard&rsquo;s leap is the leap of Christian
faith, in which one wholeheartedly commits one&rsquo;s life to God. By
means of their joint study, Carr and Ivanhoe exemplify a way of not
only bringing Daoist and Christian perspectives into constructive
comparative dialogue, but of doing so through the collaboration of
scholars with different areas of expertise.</p>

<h3 id="ConBelKnoWit">5.4 Concepts of Belief, Knowledge, and Witchcraft</h3>

<p>
Comparative studies involving African philosophies are growing in
prevalence, and many of these are relevant to philosophy of religion.
(See, e.g., Okafor 1997; Agada 2022; Stacey 2022.) One of the most
long-term and impressive projects in this area remains the
investigation of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; epistemological concepts carried
out from 1974 to 1984 by Barry Hallen and J. Olubi Sodipo (1997).
Deploying a method that they termed &ldquo;collaborative
analysis&rdquo; (1997: 121), Hallen and Sodipo undertook extended
conversations with respected figures in Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; society
known as <em>on&iacute;&#7779;&#7865;&#768;g&ugrave;n</em>
(&ldquo;masters of medicine&rdquo;). Data were gathered and analyzed
concerning the criteria that apply to the use of terms in the
Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; language that are typically translated into
English as &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; &ldquo;belief,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;witch.&rdquo; The conclusion of the study was that assumptions
on the part of previous Anglophone researchers about the supposed
universality of the concepts expressed by the latter English terms
&ldquo;have led to fundamentally false interpretations and analyses of
Yoruba thought&rdquo; (1997: 122).</p>

<p>
Without denying the semantic overlap between the relevant English and
Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; vocabulary, Hallen and Sodipo argue that
propositional attitudes such as those expressed by the English phrases
&ldquo;I believe that &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know that
&hellip;&rdquo; ought to be viewed as culturally relative (124).
Similarly, in the case of the Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; term
<em>&agrave;j&#7865;&#769;</em>, which has routinely been translated
into English as &ldquo;witch,&rdquo; Hallen and Sodipo maintain that
this translation is misleading insofar as it tends to carry with it
assumptions that are foreign to the Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; context. When
an African social group is attributed with the belief in witchcraft,
Hallen and Sodipo observe, &ldquo;The Western intellectual&rsquo;s
attitude is more or less a &lsquo;Thank goodness we don&rsquo;t
believe in <em>that</em> anymore&rsquo;, and that a society that does
is primitive, sick and inhuman&rdquo; (118). By contrast, for the
Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; spokespeople with whom Hallen and Sodipo
conversed, <em>&agrave;j&#7865;&#769;</em> has a range of meanings
that include someone who uses their medicinal abilities &ldquo;for the
welfare and benefit of mankind&rdquo; (117). Perceptively, Hallen and
Sodipo note that discovering the breadth of the concept of
<em>&agrave;j&#7865;&#769;</em> ought to prompt those who regard
&ldquo;witchcraft&rdquo; as expressing &ldquo;a conceptual and
cultural universal&rdquo; to reflect upon the range of meanings that
&ldquo;witch&rdquo; can have, and has had, in Western contexts (117);
what remains problematic, as Hallen and Sodipo see it, is the
uncritical application of potentially misleading translations without
due attention to cultural specificities.</p>

<h2 id="ChaForComPhiRel">6. Challenges for Comparative Philosophy of Religion</h2>

<h3 id="EurLeg">6.1 The Eurocentric Legacy</h3>

<p>
One type of complaint against comparative philosophy of religion is
that it all-too-often involves projecting or imposing culturally
European&mdash;or, more broadly, Western&mdash;categories onto other
cultures while assuming that those categories are universal and
normative. An equivalent complaint has long been raised against the
enterprises of &ldquo;comparative theology&rdquo; and
&ldquo;comparative religion,&rdquo; which have been accused of
assuming some version of Protestant Christianity to be the paradigm of
what a religion is and then looking around to see the extent to which
other religions satisfy, or fail to satisfy, the criteria laid down by
that paradigm (Hedges 2022: 53). In the case of comparative philosophy
of religion, Purushottama Bilimoria, from the perspective of
postcolonial theory, identifies the standard Eurocentric categories as
including, among others, &ldquo;God (the Absolute or the
Transcendent), Creation, the Problem of Evil, the Afterlife,
Immortality, Sin, Redemption, Purpose, and the End&rdquo; (Bilimoria
2003: 343). By assuming that these are the categories&mdash;or, at any
rate, the primary categories&mdash;in terms of which religions, and
philosophical analyses of religions, ought to be compared and
appraised, comparative philosophers of religion (so the accusation
goes) have biased their inquiry in favour of Western forms of
Christianity from the outset.</p>

<p>
One possible response to the charge of Eurocentrism (or
Eurohegemony&mdash;cf. Masuzawa 2005: 29) would be to point out that
neither Christianity as a whole nor Protestant Christianity in
particular is solely Western, still less solely European. Christianity
is itself a global phenomenon, having originated in the Middle East
and spread across all the inhabited continents of the world. To
conflate Christian categories with Western or European categories is
thus itself a category mistake. The proponent of the charge could
reply, however, that it is specifically Western forms of Christianity
that tend to be presupposed in much philosophy of religion, part of
the problem being that Western philosophers of religion have given
insufficient attention to the diversity of Christianities, let alone
the numerous other religions that exist. A consequence of this
presupposition is that it is not merely Christian categories that have
predominated in comparative philosophy of religion, but, more
narrowly, a subset of Western Christian categories.</p>

<p>
Even so, regardless of whether the charge is one of Eurocentrism,
Western-centrism, or Christian-centrism, it does not amount to a
charge against the viability of comparative philosophy of religion per
se; it can be construed as a call for reform and revision&mdash;an
insistence that participants in this field of study should critically
interrogate their own conceptual categories and assumptions. This is
precisely the call made by, for example, Sonia Sikka and Ashwani Kumar
Peetush when, with reference not only to comparative philosophy of
religion but to philosophy of religion across the board, they maintain
that &ldquo;philosophy of religion cannot be made more inclusive
simply by inserting a wider number of &lsquo;religions&rsquo; into the
category slots of the subject as currently constituted. The shapes of
the slots themselves need to be altered to fit varieties of beliefs
and practices configured differently than Christianity&rdquo; (Sikka
and Peetush 2021: 2).</p>

<p>
The demand for greater inclusivity is sometimes phrased in terms of
&ldquo;decolonization.&rdquo; Leah Kalmanson (2017), for instance,
utilizes the terms &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; (with reference particularly
to Buddhism) and &ldquo;dao&rdquo; (with reference to Daoism) and
raises the question of why these and other non-English terms should
not be prioritized over the term &ldquo;religion&rdquo; when
undertaking comparisons in philosophy of religion. In deploying the
terms &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; and &ldquo;dao,&rdquo; Kalmanson aims not
at &ldquo;<em>diversification</em> but <em>decolonization</em>&rdquo;;
she intends to counter &ldquo;the realities of ongoing power
differences in academia&rdquo; through her choice of words that do not
contribute to &ldquo;hegemonic practices&rdquo; (2017: 255). Such
moves, away from concepts expressed in European languages and towards
the recognition of non-European &ldquo;ways of knowing,&rdquo; accords
with broader academic trends that seek &ldquo;to deconstruct and
decentre the Eurocentric image of the world&rdquo; (Afolayan,
Yacob-Haliso, and Oloruntoba 2021).</p>

<h3 id="DoiVioIntTra">6.2 Doing Violence to the Integrity of Traditions?</h3>

<p>
A potential objection that might be targeted most specifically at the
kind of problem-solving approach to comparative philosophy of religion
advocated by Chakrabarti and Weber (2016) and by Yujin Nagasawa (2017)
is that such an approach fails to respect the integrity of religious
or philosophical traditions. Chakrabarti and Weber envisage research
projects in which the emphasis is placed on &ldquo;solving hitherto
unsolved problems&rdquo; in philosophy without making any claim to be
providing &ldquo;&lsquo;correct exposition&rsquo;&rdquo; of the
traditions from which ideas are being borrowed (Chakrabarti and Weber
2016: 22). The danger of this blas&eacute; attitude to accurate
exposition is that ideas may end up being borrowed in ways that uproot
them from the very cultural, religious, and philosophical contexts
that give them the sense that they have.</p>

<p>
The charge of doing violence to the integrity of traditions resembles
the charge of &ldquo;cultural appropriation,&rdquo; which is held to
occur when members of one culture appropriate, in the sense of
illicitly adopt, ideas or practices from another culture. Cultural
appropriation is widely regarded as especially pernicious when those
who are doing the appropriating belong to a culture that is
economically and politically more powerful than the one from which the
ideas or practices are being appropriated. One thing that
practitioners of comparative or cross-cultural philosophy of religion
can do to avoid being guilty of illicitly appropriating ideas from
other cultures is to give due attention to the cultural contexts in
which the ideas they are discussing have their original place. Another
option is to pursue Nagasawa&rsquo;s aim of developing collaborative
ventures in which conceptual and theoretical resources are shared by
philosophers from different traditions to address common issues (see
3.4 above). Although this emphasis on collaboration circumvents the
obvious danger of simply appropriating ideas from multiple traditions
without bothering to expound the ideas correctly, it nonetheless
presupposes the feasibility of combining ideas from disparate contexts
without thereby diluting or distorting their respective meanings. It
also presupposes that there are &ldquo;common problems&rdquo; which
take sufficiently similar forms across diverse religious and
philosophical traditions to be amenable to collective solutions. The
fruitfulness of such collaborative philosophizing ought not to be
prejudged, but will no doubt be shown through exemplary cases.</p>

<p>
Before assuming that what has come to be designated as cultural
appropriation is in every case malign, it should be acknowledged that
views differ on this matter among certain marginalized or subordinated
groups themselves. For example, notwithstanding many protests
concerning the adoption by outsiders of the ceremonial items or
practices of Native American peoples, &ldquo;a significant
minority&rdquo; of these peoples welcome participation in &ldquo;the
red road&rdquo; (that is, Native American ways of life) for the
engendering of a more harmonious relationship with the earth (Taylor
1997: 187; see also Brunk and Young 2009: 96). This is among the vital
lessons that comparative philosophy of religion, when done well, can
teach us: that religious and philosophical traditions are rarely, if
ever, homogeneous phenomena&mdash;they are likely to be internally
complex and variegated.</p>

<h3 id="EntTra">6.3 The Entanglements of Traditions</h3>

<p>
The charge that there is anything suspect about bringing ideas from
different religious or philosophical traditions into relation or into
dialogue with one another becomes still less forceful when one
acknowledges the extent to which these &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; have
already undergone processes of mutual influence and intermingling over
the long course of history. As the editors of a volume on world
philosophy put it, &ldquo;the notion of hermetically sealed traditions
in parallel development is largely a historical fiction&rdquo;
(Edelglass and Garfield 2011: 4). A similar contention is made by
Omedi Ochieng in a book on the &ldquo;good life&rdquo; in African
philosophy: against those who assume that
&ldquo;Western&rdquo;&mdash;or, as Ochieng prefers, &ldquo;North
Atlantic&rdquo;&mdash;philosophy is the paradigm tradition of
philosophy that was then exported to other countries and continents,
Ochieng argues that &ldquo;the North Atlantic canon&rdquo; is itself
&ldquo;inextricably bound and indeed constituted by the presence of
Africans, Asians, Arabs, Native Americans, and so on&rdquo; (Ochieng
2017: 5). By this, Ochieng means that even in texts where the peoples
heralding from places outside the North Atlantic region are not
overtly referred to, such texts are nonetheless written with an
implicit awareness of the lives and ideas of those peoples. Through
the notion of a mutually constitutive relationship, Ochieng seeks to
avoid oversimplified representations such as that of different
&ldquo;orders of incommensurable discourses&rdquo; or, at the other
extreme, traditions that are &ldquo;subsumable or reducible to one
another&rdquo; (2017: 5&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
The recognition of the &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; (Chakrabarti and
Weber 2016: 5) or &ldquo;intertwinement&rdquo; (Ochieng 2017: 6) of
traditions need not vitiate the project of comparative philosophy of
religion, but it does necessitate a degree of subtlety on the part of
those who carry out the exercise. A balance must be struck that, as
Ochieng recommends, avoids the extremes both of treating
traditions&mdash;whether religious or philosophical&mdash;as
incomparably alien to one another and of regarding them as mutually
indistinguishable. It is possible to engage in comparison without
assuming that what are being compared run on entirely separate
tracks.</p>

<h3 id="DifAcqExpMulTra">6.4 The Difficulty of Acquiring Expertise in Multiple Traditions</h3>

<p>
A final challenge for comparative philosophy of
religion&mdash;although it is perhaps the first challenge faced by
anyone who attempts to undertake this kind of philosophy&mdash;is the
sheer difficulty of gaining sufficient expertise in more than one
religion, or in more than one tradition of philosophizing about
religion, to do justice to the subject matter under investigation.
Clayton remarks that &ldquo;The ideal would be, from intimate
knowledge of several traditions, to develop a reflective style that is
global and not simply bi-cultural&rdquo;; he is quick to add, however,
that this ideal &ldquo;is just that &mdash; <em>an ideal</em>&rdquo;
(Clayton 2006: 101). In other words, no matter how much any one
philosopher may aspire to develop extensive knowledge of multiple
traditions, it is unlikely that this will be widely achieved; thus
two-way (bicultural or bi-religious) comparisons may have to suffice
for most budding comparative philosophers. This is especially true of
the contemporary era, when there are career-related pressures for
academic philosophers to become hyperspecialized in only one or two
areas of philosophy, lest they fail to keep up to speed with the
rapidly growing literature in their subfield.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, those who call for an expansion or diversification of
philosophy of religion&mdash;regardless of whether they apply the term
&ldquo;comparative philosophy of religion&rdquo; to that expansive
endeavour&mdash;rarely demand that individuals should become experts
in multiple religions or philosophical traditions. What is normally
proposed is that the field of philosophy of religion as a whole should
expand its parameters, the aim being for the field to become more
welcoming of a variety of perspectives and topics of inquiry. The
result might be that, collectively, philosophers of religion could
legitimately claim that their branch of philosophy takes into account
the whole gamut of religions&mdash;the &ldquo;spectrum of
worldviews&rdquo; (Vroom 2006)&mdash;or at least a representative
selection of them, rather than only a small minority or an unduly
abstract conception of &ldquo;theism.&rdquo; Comparative philosophy of
religion is indeed a collective enterprise, for it is only through the
participation of many contributors that a rich understanding of the
phenomenon of religion, and the plurality of religions, can be
cultivated.</p>
