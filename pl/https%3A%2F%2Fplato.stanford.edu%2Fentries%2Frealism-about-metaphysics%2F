<h1>Realism and Anti-Realism about Metaphysics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Feb 10, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
This entry surveys the literature surrounding certain kinds of views
about metaphysics. In particular, the central concern here will be
with <em>critiques</em> of metaphysics and responses to those
critiques. And so the views under discussion can be thought of as
<em>metametaphysical</em> views, or <em>metaontological</em>
views.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#ReaAntReaAboMetVsReaAntReaMet">Section 1</a>
 distinguishes the views to be discussed&mdash;namely, realist and
anti-realist views <em>about</em> metaphysics&mdash;from views of
another kind (namely, realist and anti-realist views <em>in</em>
metaphysics). Then the survey of views begins in
 <a href="#LocAntReaVie">section 2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The survey is organized around <em>anti-realist</em> views&mdash;i.e.,
views that offer critiques of metaphysics&mdash;and realist responses
to the anti-realist critiques. This mirrors how the literature in this
area has gone. Most of the work done in support of realism about
metaphysics has been aimed at simply defending metaphysics against
anti-realist critiques, rather than developing positive realist views.
This is perhaps because realism about metaphysics is something like
the &ldquo;default view&rdquo; in metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Lots of philosophers seem to have an intuitive feeling that
there&rsquo;s something <em>wrong</em> with certain kinds of
metaphysical questions. One might jokingly put the thought here like
this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When two grown-ass adults with PhDs and genius-level IQs are arguing
at length about whether tables exist&mdash;employing sophisticated,
often very technical arguments&mdash;something has gone badly
wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But while it&rsquo;s easy to poke fun, it&rsquo;s much harder to
produce cogent <em>arguments</em> for the claim that there&rsquo;s
something wrong with metaphysics. This entry surveys a few
anti-realist attempts to produce such arguments, as well as some
realist responses to these arguments.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important distinguish <em>global</em> critiques of
metaphysics in general from <em>local</em> critiques of specific
metaphysical questions. The history of philosophy has seen many
critiques of the first kind&mdash;from people like Hume (1748), Kant
(1781/87), Wittgenstein (1921, 1953), and the logical positivists of
the first half of the twentieth century. But this entry covers works
that were written later than this&mdash;the era covered can be thought
of as beginning in 1950, with the publication of Carnap&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology&rdquo;&mdash;and much of
this later work is profitably thought of as being driven by local
critiques. Thus, most of this entry
 (<a href="#LocAntReaVie">section 2</a>
 and
 <a href="#ObjLocAntReaVie">section 3</a>)
 will be concerned with local critiques of specific metaphysical
questions. In particular, section 2 will cover a variety of local
anti-realist views; and section 3 will cover realist responses to
these local critiques. But then in
 <a href="#GloAntReaVie">section 4</a>,
 we will consider a few anti-realist views that are more global, or
more general.</p>

<h2 id="ReaAntReaAboMetVsReaAntReaMet">1. Realism and Anti-Realism <em>About</em> Metaphysics vs. Realism and Anti-Realism <em>In</em> Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
The terms &lsquo;realism&rsquo; and &lsquo;anti-realism&rsquo; will be
used to denote the two main kinds of views that will be discussed. But
since these terms can be used to mean very different things, even
within the confines of the literature on a single metaphysical
question, some care is needed to clarify the kinds of views that will
be under discussion here. For reasons that will become clear shortly,
it makes sense to start with anti-realism, rather than realism.</p>

<p>
Very roughly, if MQ is a metaphysical question, then to endorse an
anti-realist view of MQ, in the sense at issue in this entry, is to
maintain that there&rsquo;s something <em>wrong</em> with MQ. So, for
example, an anti-realist about MQ might claim that MQ is
<em>trivial</em>, or <em>non-factual</em>, or that debates about MQ
are <em>merely verbal</em>. Indeed, these three kinds of anti-realist
views&mdash;i.e., <em>trivialist</em> views, <em>non-factualist</em>
views, and <em>mere-verbalist</em> views&mdash;will be the main kinds
of views discussed in this entry. And more precise definitions of
these three kinds of views will emerge in
 <a href="#LocAntReaVie">section 2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
To endorse a <em>realist</em> view of MQ, on the other hand, is, very
roughly, to maintain that no such anti-realist view of MQ is true. So,
at the very least, realism about MQ implies that trivialist,
non-factualist, and mere-verbalist views of MQ are all false. But
realist views of MQ also typically imply other claims as
well&mdash;e.g., that MQ is a deep and important question about the
nature of reality (in particular, the mind-and-language-independent
part of reality).</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important to distinguish realist and anti-realist views of
this kind from realist and anti-realist views of another kind. To this
end, consider the following metaphysical question:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>The composite-object question</em>: Are there any such things as
composite objects&mdash;i.e., objects that have proper
parts&mdash;like tables and cats and rocks?</p>

<p>
On one very standard way of speaking, we can say that those who answer
this question in the affirmative&mdash;i.e., those who say that there
<em>are</em> composite objects&mdash;are <em>realists</em> about
composite objects; and those who answer the above question in the
negative are <em>anti-realists</em> about composite objects&mdash;or
<em>nihilists</em>, as they&rsquo;re often called. But this entry is
not centrally concerned with these kinds of realism and anti-realism;
it isn&rsquo;t (centrally) concerned with realism and anti-realism
<em>about composite objects</em>; rather, the central concern is with
realism and anti-realism <em>about metaphysical
questions</em>&mdash;e.g., the composite-object question. And, to
repeat, anti-realist views of this kind might say that the
composite-object question is <em>trivial</em>, or
<em>non-factual</em>, or <em>merely verbal</em>.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that these two kinds of
realist/anti-realist divides can cut across each other. For example,
realists about composite objects (i.e., those who believe that there
<em>do exist</em> composite objects, e.g., tables or cats or whatever)
can be anti-realists about the composite-object question&mdash;for,
e.g., they might claim that the composite-object question is entirely
trivial (and that it&rsquo;s an utterly obvious and trivial fact that
tables
 exist).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 And anti-realists about composite objects (i.e., nihilists) can be
realists about the composite-object question&mdash;for, e.g., they can
claim that the composite-object question is a deep and important
question about the nature of reality (and that nihilism is a deep and
important fact about mind-independent
 reality).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It&rsquo;s plausible to think of these two kinds of
realist/anti-realist divides as arising at different levels of
inquiry. For example, the dispute between realists and anti-realists
<em>about tables</em> is a <em>first-order</em> dispute. And the
dispute between realists and anti-realists <em>about the
composite-object question</em> is a <em>second-order</em> dispute.
This is why the latter dispute is often characterized as a dispute in
metametaphysics, or metaontology.</p>

<h2 id="LocAntReaVie">2. Local Anti-Realist Views</h2>

<p>
In this section, we will consider three different kinds of local
anti-realist views, namely, <em>trivialism</em>,
<em>mere-verbalism</em>, and <em>non-factualism</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Tri">2.1 Trivialism</h3>

<p>
The first kind of local anti-realist view that we&rsquo;ll consider is
the following:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Trivialism about a metaphysical question MQ</em> is the view that
(a) there&rsquo;s a fact of the matter about the answer to MQ, but (b)
it&rsquo;s an utterly trivial fact&mdash;along the lines of the fact
that all bachelors are unmarried, or the fact that there are no
married bachelors. More specifically, the facts that settle MQ are not
substantive metaphysical facts at all; on the contrary, they&rsquo;re
just <em>semantic</em> facts (i.e., facts about the meanings or truth
conditions of our sentences), together perhaps with ordinary empirical
facts that are entirely uncontroversial.</p>

<p>
Consider, e.g., the composite-object question. We can think of this
question as being about the truth values of sentences like the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em indent" id="senTable">
<dt>[Table]</dt>
<dd>There exist tables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Those who believe in composite objects will say that [Table] is true,
and those who don&rsquo;t believe in composite objects&mdash;i.e.,
nihilists&mdash;will say that [Table] is false. It&rsquo;s important
to note, however, that nihilists don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re
hallucinating when we think we&rsquo;re seeing tables; they just think
that what we&rsquo;re actually seeing in these situations aren&rsquo;t
tables. For instance, according to one popular version of nihilism,
what we&rsquo;re seeing in these situations are <em>huge pluralities
of tiny simples</em>&mdash;where a <em>simple</em> is an object that
doesn&rsquo;t have any proper parts. More specifically, according to
this version of nihilism, what we&rsquo;re actually seeing (when it
seems like we&rsquo;re seeing tables) are huge pluralities of simples
that are arranged in a table-type way&mdash;or, in the lingo of the
composite-object debate, what we&rsquo;re seeing are <em>simples
arranged tablewise</em>.</p>

<p>
Given all of this, one way to be a trivialist about the
composite-object question is to endorse the following view:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Trivialist Tableism</em>: (i) [Table] is obviously true because
(a) the existence of simples arranged tablewise is already sufficient
for the truth of [Table]&mdash;where, again, a <em>simple</em> is an
object with no proper parts&mdash;and (b) it&rsquo;s entirely
<em>obvious</em> (from, e.g., a cursory glance at people&rsquo;s
dining rooms) that there are simples arranged tablewise. And (ii)
likewise for other sentences like
 [Table].<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The really important claim in this view is claim (a). But let&rsquo;s
start by saying a few words about claim (b). The idea behind claim (b)
is that whatever we end up saying about the existence of composite
objects like tables, we should all agree that there are simples
arranged tablewise. Even philosophers who reject the existence of
composite objects like tables (e.g., van Inwagen (1990), Merricks
(2001), Rosen and Dorr (2002), and Sider (2013)) will still admit that
there are simples arranged tablewise. After all, to repeat, these
philosophers don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re hallucinating when we think
we&rsquo;re seeing tables; they just think that what we&rsquo;re
actually seeing in these situations are huge pluralities of simples
arranged tablewise.</p>

<p>
Now, you might object that some people&mdash;namely, <em>mereological
monists</em>&mdash;will deny that there are simples arranged
tablewise. More specifically, you might object here by saying
something like the following:</p>

<p class="indent">
Let <em>mereological monism</em> be the view that there exists exactly
one concrete object, namely, the entire universe. On this
view&mdash;which has been endorsed by, e.g., Horgan and Potr&#269;
(2000) and Builes (2021, 2023)&mdash;the universe is just a great big
simple that doesn&rsquo;t have any proper parts. So this view is a
version of <em>nihilism</em>&mdash;i.e., it entails that there are no
such things as composite objects. But it also seems to imply that
there aren&rsquo;t any simples arranged tablewise&mdash;because,
according to this view, there are no objects smaller than the
universe. And so the claim that there <em>are</em> simples arranged
tablewise isn&rsquo;t as uncontroversial as the above trivialist
tableist view implies that it is.</p>

<p>
But we can sidestep this worry by just defining &lsquo;simples
arranged tablewise&rsquo; so that if mereological monism is true (and
if, otherwise, things are as they actually are), then the
<em>universe</em> counts as a simple that&rsquo;s arranged tablewise.
If we define our terms in this way, then all parties to the dispute
will agree that there are simples arranged tablewise, and so we can
treat the claim that there are simples arranged tablewise as trivial
in the relevant sense of the term.</p>

<p>
(Actually, there will still be some people who would resist the claim
that there are simples arranged tablewise&mdash;e.g., people who think
that all objects are <em>gunky</em> (i.e., that all objects have
proper parts). We could bring these people into the fold by switching
from &lsquo;simples arranged tablewise&rsquo; to &lsquo;objects
arranged tablewise&rsquo;, but we needn&rsquo;t bother with this
 here.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>)</p>
 
<p>
Let&rsquo;s move on now to claim (a) in the definition of trivialist
tableism. The idea behind claim (a) is essentially this: We can derive
the existence of tables (and, hence, composite objects) from a
<em>trivial</em> claim that virtually all of us agree on (namely, that
there are simples arranged tablewise) together with a
<em>semantic</em> claim about the truth conditions of [Table] (namely,
that the existence of simples arranged tablewise is already sufficient
for the truth of [Table]). And it&rsquo;s important to note that the
<em>controversial</em> part of trivialist tableism is the second claim
here&mdash;i.e., the claim about the truth conditions of sentences
like [Table]&mdash;and so it&rsquo;s a claim about <em>language</em>.
And this is a general feature of trivialist views; the controversial
claims in these views are claims about <em>meaning</em>, or <em>truth
conditions</em>, or some such thing.</p>

<p>
How might trivialists go about <em>arguing</em> for their semantic
claim about [Table]? The most obvious way to do this is to take their
semantic claim to be a claim about what [Table] means in <em>ordinary
English</em>, and to then argue for this claim by (a) presenting
empirical evidence for the thesis that ordinary speakers assent to
sentences like &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a table here&rsquo; when presented
with simples arranged tablewise, and (b) arguing for a principle of
charity that, together with the empirical evidence just mentioned in
point (a), implies that, in ordinary language, the existence of
simples arranged tablewise is sufficient for the truth of sentences
like [Table]. (See Hirsch 2009 for an argument of this kind.)</p>

<p>
(Trivialist views of the kind discussed in this section should be
distinguished from <em>Moorean</em> views. Mooreans about the
composite-object question might claim that we have an immediate
intuition that tables exist and that we&rsquo;re more certain of this
claim than we are of any of the premises that appear in any of the
arguments against the existence of
 tables.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 But, by itself, this isn&rsquo;t a trivialist view. In order to count
as trivialists, Mooreans would need to claim that the question of
whether tables exist is settled by <em>semantic facts</em>, i.e., by
facts about the meanings (or truth conditions, or some such thing) of
our sentences, together with uncontroversial empirical facts. In other
words, in order to count as trivialists, Mooreans would need to commit
to a trivialist semantic theory of the kind discussed above&mdash;and,
again, semantic theories of this kind are extremely controversial. If
Mooreans don&rsquo;t commit to a trivialist semantic theory, then
their view won&rsquo;t count as an anti-realist view at all. Indeed,
their view will be compatible with a rather strong kind of
realism&mdash;a kind that implies not just that there are substantive
metaphysical facts about the existence of composite objects, but that
we can access these facts by means of a mysterious faculty of
intuition.)</p>

<h4 id="ActTri">2.1.1 Actual Trivialists</h4>

<p>
Trivialist views have been endorsed by numerous philosophers in
connection with numerous metaphysical questions.</p>

<p>
Carnap (1950) can be interpreted as endorsing a trivialist view of the
abstract-object question, i.e., the question of whether there are any
such things as abstract objects like numbers (where an <em>abstract
object</em> is an object that&rsquo;s non-physical, non-mental, and
 non-spatiotemporal<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>).
 On Carnap&rsquo;s view, the sentence &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo; is
trivially true&mdash;indeed, analytic&mdash;in what he calls <em>the
linguistic framework of numbers</em>. And Carnap thinks that our
linguistic framework <em>includes</em> the framework of numbers. And
so, on Carnap&rsquo;s view, &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo; is trivially
true in our language.</p>

<p>
Thomasson (2007, 2009, 2015) endorses trivialist views of multiple
ontological questions, most notably, the composite-object question,
the abstract-object question, and the coincident-object question
(i.e., the question of whether there are any statue-lump-style
coincident objects). In particular, on Thomasson&rsquo;s view, the
application conditions for predicates like &lsquo;is a table&rsquo;
and &lsquo;is a number&rsquo; are trivially satisfied. E.g., on her
view, the existence of simples arranged tablewise is already
sufficient for the truth of &lsquo;There are tables&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Hirsch (2002, 2009) endorses trivialist views of the composite-object
question and the perdurantism-vs-endurantism question (i.e., the
question of whether ordinary objects have temporal parts). We&rsquo;ll
see below that he also endorses mere-verbalist views of these two
questions, but as we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#ActMerVer">section 2.2.3</a>,
 these two kinds of views (i.e., trivialist views and mere-verbalist
views) are compatible with one another. In a nutshell, Hirsch&rsquo;s
view is that (a) debates about these two questions are merely verbal,
and (b) ordinary English is a composite-object-realist language and an
endurantist language, and so, in ordinary English, endurantism and
composite-object realism are true&mdash;indeed, they&rsquo;re
<em>trivially</em> true, in the relevant sense of the term.</p>

<p>
Rayo (2013) endorses trivialist views of the abstract-object question
and the composite-object question. On his view, the sentences
&lsquo;The number of witches is 0&rsquo; and &lsquo;There are no
witches&rsquo; <em>say the same thing</em>&mdash;or, as he puts it,
for the number of witches to be 0 <em>just is</em> for there to be no
witches&mdash;and so the claim that numbers exist follows trivially
from the claim that there are no witches. And likewise, on
Rayo&rsquo;s view, &lsquo;There are tables&rsquo; and &lsquo;There are
some things arranged tablewise&rsquo; <em>say the same
thing</em>&mdash;or, again, in Rayo&rsquo;s lingo, for there to be
tables <em>just is</em> for there to be some things arranged
tablewise.</p>

<p>
Also, Schiffer (2003) endorses a trivialist view of the
abstract-object question; most notably, on Schiffer&rsquo;s view, the
existence of propositions is entirely trivial. And Hale and Wright
(2001, 2009) endorse a trivialist view of the question of whether
numbers exist. And Van Fraassen (2002) endorses a version of
trivialism about the composite-object question.</p>

<p>
Hofweber (2016) develops a non-standard sort of trivialist view about
the question of whether there are numbers, as well as a wide variety
of other ontological questions. We&rsquo;ll consider his view in more
detail in
 <a href="#GloAntReaVie">section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
One might interpret Unger (2014) as endorsing trivialist views of
various metaphysical questions, e.g., the composite-object question;
but he&rsquo;s probably better interpreted as endorsing mere-verbalist
views.</p>

<p>
Finally, Warren (2020) endorses a trivialist (and conventionalist)
view of the question of whether there are any such things as
numbers.</p>

<h3 id="MerVer">2.2 Mere-Verbalism</h3>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s turn now to anti-realist views of another kind, namely,
<em>mere-verbalist</em> views. Very roughly, mere-verbalist views of a
metaphysical question MQ say that debates about MQ are merely verbal.
We&rsquo;ll get a more careful formulation of this view in
 <a href="#MerVerAboMetQue">section 2.2.2</a>,
 but first, we need to get clear on what the term &lsquo;<em>merely
verbal debate</em>&rsquo; will mean in this entry.</p>

<h4 id="MerVerDeb">2.2.1 Merely Verbal Debates</h4>

<p>
Sometimes people get into debates that are, in an important sense,
<em>merely verbal</em>&mdash;and <em>not really factual</em>. To take
an example from Bennett (2009), suppose that you&rsquo;re at a bar,
and two of your friends&mdash;Jack and Jill&mdash;get into a debate
about whether your drink is a <em>martini</em>. But suppose that (a)
Jack and Jill agree about the relevant worldly facts about your
drink&mdash;namely, that it&rsquo;s a mixture of vodka and green apple
liqueur in a V-shaped glass&mdash;and (b) they disagree about whether
your drink is a martini only because they mean different things by
&lsquo;martini&rsquo; (Jill means <em>drink made of gin and a splash
of vermouth</em>, and Jack means <em>alcoholic drink in a V-shaped
glass</em>). Then, intuitively, this debate is merely verbal.</p>

<p>
We can make this more precise with the following definition:</p>

<p class="indent">
Let <em>D</em> be a debate (or a dispute&mdash;we can use these two
words interchangeably) between two people, P1 and P2, over the truth
value of a sentence <em>S</em>, in which P1 says that <em>S</em> is
true and P2 says that <em>S</em> is false; then <em>D</em> is
<em>merely verbal</em> if and only if (a) P1 and P2 mean different
things by <em>S</em>&mdash;or, more precisely, <em>S</em> expresses
different propositions in the languages of P1 and P2&mdash;and (b)
<em>S</em> is obviously true (or trivially true, or some such thing)
in P1&rsquo;s language, and <em>S</em> is obviously false (or
trivially false, or some such thing) in P2&rsquo;s language.</p>

<p>
So, e.g., on this definition, the above dispute between Jack and Jill
counts as merely verbal. For (a) Jack and Jill mean different things
by &lsquo;That drink is a martini&rsquo;, and (b) that sentence is
obviously true in Jack&rsquo;s language, and obviously false in
Jill&rsquo;s language.</p>

<p>
(You might worry that if P1 and P2 are speaking the same public
language (e.g., English), then they mean the same thing by
<em>S</em>&mdash;namely, whatever <em>S</em> means in
 English.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 E.g., you might think that if Jack and Jill are both speaking
English, then in <em>both</em> of their utterances, the word
&lsquo;martini&rsquo; means whatever it means in English&mdash;and so,
in fact, Jack and Jill <em>mean the same thing</em> by &lsquo;That
drink is a martini&rsquo;. But we can sidestep this worry by giving a
stipulative definition of the expression &lsquo;the language of person
<em>P</em>&rsquo;. Following Hirsch (2009), we can say that <em>the
language of <em>P</em></em>&mdash;or <em>P&rsquo;s
language</em>&mdash;is the language that would be spoken by a
community of people just like <em>P</em>. Given this, the above worry
just goes away; e.g., according to this definition, the word
&lsquo;martini&rsquo; clearly has a different meaning in Jack&rsquo;s
language than it does in Jill&rsquo;s language.)</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that the above definition of
&lsquo;merely verbal debate&rsquo; is not intended to capture the
<em>ordinary notion</em> of a merely verbal debate, or all and only
the debates that seem to us (intuitively) to be merely verbal. Rather,
the intent here is to provide a <em>stipulative</em> definition of a
concept that will be helpful in characterizing a certain kind of
anti-realist view about metaphysical questions.</p>

<p>
But even granting that the above definition is stipulative, you might
wonder why we&rsquo;re defining &lsquo;merely verbal debate&rsquo; in
precisely this way. In particular, you might consider clause (b) from
the definition:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt id="clauseb">(b)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> is obviously true in P1&rsquo;s language, and
<em>S</em> is obviously false in P2&rsquo;s language.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and wonder why it requires the truth values of <em>S</em> to be
<em>obvious</em> in the two languages; more specifically, you might
wonder why we don&rsquo;t replace clause (b) with the following
alternative clause:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt id="clausebS">(b*)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> is true in P1&rsquo;s language and false in P2&rsquo;s
language.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The answer is that we need to require obviousness (or something like
obviousness) to get the result that the debate is <em>merely</em>
verbal. To appreciate this, consider the following debate between Luna
and Althea:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Luna says that &lsquo;God exists&rsquo; is true, and Althea says that
&lsquo;God exists&rsquo; is false; but Althea uses the word
&lsquo;God&rsquo; to refer to the God of Christianity (if that God
exists), and Luna uses it to refer to a supernatural force of love
that&rsquo;s at work in the universe (if that force exists).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This debate is surely <em>partly</em> verbal; but insofar as the
sentence &lsquo;God exists&rsquo; is controversial in <em>both
languages</em>&mdash;i.e., in Luna&rsquo;s language and in
Althea&rsquo;s language&mdash;the debate doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
<em>merely</em> verbal. Now, to this, you might respond as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whether the debate between Luna and Althea is merely verbal depends on
facts about Luna and Althea. If they both agree that (a) there is no
Christian God, but (b) there <em>is</em> a supernatural force of love
at work in the universe, then their debate <em>is</em> merely
verbal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you like this response, then you might want to replace clause (b),
in the above definition of &lsquo;merely verbal debate&rsquo;, with
the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em indent">
<dt id="clausebSS">(b**)</dt>
<dd>P1 and P2 would agree that <em>S</em> is true in P1&rsquo;s
language and false in P2&rsquo;s
 language.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
We <em>could</em> proceed in this way&mdash;defining &lsquo;merely
verbal debate&rsquo; in terms of what P1 and P2 believe, instead of
what seems obvious or trivial to <em>us</em>&mdash;and for some
purposes, this definition would be very useful. But in the present
context&mdash;i.e., the context of discussing mere-verbalist critiques
of metaphysics&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to use the definition given
above (i.e., the definition that employs clause (b) instead of (b**)).
For if we use (b**), then the claim that some metaphysical debate is
merely verbal will be compatible with the claim that there are <em>two
different substantive metaphysical questions</em> at issue in
connection with the given debate. And that doesn&rsquo;t seem like
much of a <em>critique</em>. In short&mdash;and this will become clear
in
 <a href="#MerVerAboMetQue">subsection 2.2.2</a>&mdash;if
 we use the above definition (i.e., the one containing clause (b)
instead of (b**)), it will be easier to use the notion of a merely
verbal debate to articulate a kind of mere-verbalism about
metaphysical questions that counts as a kind of <em>anti-realism</em>
about metaphysical questions.</p>

<h4 id="MerVerAboMetQue">2.2.2 Mere-Verbalism About Metaphysical Questions</h4>

<p>
In this section, we&rsquo;ll articulate a kind of mere-verbalism that
one can endorse of a metaphysical question. We&rsquo;ll focus on
<em>the temporal-ontology question</em>&mdash;i.e., the question of
whether past and future objects exist&mdash;and to make things easy,
we&rsquo;ll assume that either (a) past and future objects
<em>both</em> exist or (b) <em>neither</em> of them
 exist.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Given this simplifying assumption, the temporal-ontology question is
equivalent to the question of whether <em>presentism</em> or
<em>eternalism</em> is true&mdash;where, roughly speaking,
<em>presentism</em> is the view that only present objects exist, and
<em>eternalism</em> is the view that past, present, and future objects
all
 exist.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 (For more precise definitions of presentism and eternalism, see the
entries on
 <a href="../time/">time</a>
 and
 <a href="../presentism/">presentism</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
We can think of the temporal-ontology question as being about the
truth values of sentences like the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag6em indent" id="dinosaurs">
<dt>[Dinosaur]</dt>
<dd>There exist dinosaurs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Eternalists claim that sentence like [Dinosaur] are true, and
presentists claim that they&rsquo;re false. But one might think that
when presentists and eternalists make these claims, they&rsquo;re
<em>speaking different languages</em>. More specifically, one might
think that sentences like [Dinosaur] are <em>obviously true in the
language of eternalists and obviously false in the language of
presentists</em>. To see how one might develop a view of this kind,
consider the following two languages:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Presentese</em> is a language in which (a) [Dinosaur] is a
<em>present-tense</em> sentence that expresses the (obviously false)
proposition that dinosaurs exist at the present time, i.e., in the
twenty-first century; and (b) likewise for other sentences like
[Dinosaur].</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Eternalese</em> is a language in which (a) [Dinosaur] is a
<em>tenseless</em> sentence that expresses the (obviously true)
proposition that either there were dinosaurs, or there will be
dinosaurs, or there are dinosaurs at the present time; and (b)
likewise for other sentences like [Dinosaur].</p>

<p>
Given this, one might endorse the following view:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>View V</em>: Typical debates about the temporal-ontology
question&mdash;i.e., typical debates between mainstream philosophers
who are actually debating the temporal-ontology question in
print&mdash;are merely verbal. For Eternalese is the language of
typical mainstream eternalists, and Presentese is the language of
typical mainstream presentists, and so sentences like [Dinosaur] are
obviously true in the language of eternalists and obviously false in
the language of presentists.</p>

<p>
Now, of course, you might doubt that this view is true; in particular,
you might doubt that typical presentists and eternalists really do
speak these languages. We&rsquo;ll return to this issue in
 <a href="#ObjLocAntReaVie">section 3</a>,
 but the more important point to note here is that View <em>V</em> is
<em>not an anti-realist</em> view of the temporal-ontology
question&mdash;on the way that &lsquo;anti-realism&rsquo; is being
used in this entry&mdash;because it doesn&rsquo;t imply that
there&rsquo;s something <em>wrong</em> with the temporal-ontology
question. To appreciate this, notice that View <em>V</em> is perfectly
compatible with the claim that the temporal-ontology question is a
deep and important question about the nature of mind-independent
reality that&rsquo;s both factual and non-trivial. View <em>V</em> is
a critique not of the temporal-ontology question, but of a group of
<em>actual philosophers</em>&mdash;namely, the philosophers who have
actually been debating the temporal-ontology question in print.</p>

<p>
But while View <em>V</em> isn&rsquo;t an anti-realist view, it&rsquo;s
easy to define a kind of mere-verbalism that <em>is</em> a kind of
anti-realism. To get at this kind of view, we need to define three
more kinds of debates, in addition to merely verbal debates:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>A <em>debate about meaning</em> is a debate about the truth value
of a sentence of the form &lsquo;Word <em>W</em> means <em>X</em> in
language <em>L</em>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;In <em>L</em>, the sentence
<em>S</em> is true if and only if <em>p</em>&rsquo;, or something
along these lines). (So, e.g., if we got into a debate about what the
word &lsquo;martini&rsquo; means in folk English, we would be having a
debate about meaning.)</li>

<li>A <em>conceptual-engineering debate</em> (or an
<em>ameliorative</em> debate) is a debate about the truth value of a
sentence of the form &lsquo;We <em>should</em> use word <em>W</em> to
mean <em>X</em>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;We should employ a language in which
the sentence <em>S</em> is true iff <em>p</em>&rsquo;, or something
along these lines). (So, e.g., if we got into a debate about how we
<em>should</em> use &lsquo;martini&rsquo; in our language, we would be
having a conceptual-engineering debate (or an ameliorative
 debate).)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>A <em>non-verbal debate</em> is a debate that&rsquo;s neither
merely verbal nor about meaning nor a conceptual-engineering
debate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given these definitions, we can define mere-verbalism as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Mere-verbalism about a metaphysical question MQ</em> is the view
that there is no non-verbal
 (metaphysical<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>)
 debate to be had about MQ. (In other words, on this view, any
(metaphysical) debate about MQ would have to be either merely verbal
or about meaning or a conceptual-engineering
 debate.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Unlike View <em>V</em>, mere-verbalism about MQ involves a
<em>critique</em> of MQ&mdash;it entails that there&rsquo;s something
<em>wrong</em> with MQ. For it entails that there is no debate
<em>about reality</em>&mdash;or, rather, about the non-linguistic part
of reality&mdash;to be had in connection with MQ. And insofar as MQ is
supposed to be a <em>metaphysical</em> question, that seems like a
<em>critique</em> of MQ.</p>

<p>
But you might wonder how a mere-verbalist view could be true; you
might wonder how it could be the case that there&rsquo;s no non-verbal
debate to be had about a metaphysical question. To see how this could
be the case, let&rsquo;s start with the following two definitions:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>Let&rsquo;s say that a language <em>L</em> is <em>initially
relevant</em> to a metaphysical question MQ just in case it&rsquo;s at
least initially plausible that <em>L</em> is a language that matters
vis-&agrave;-vis MQ.</li>

<li>And let&rsquo;s say that <em>L</em> <em>matters vis-&agrave;-vis
MQ</em> just in case it&rsquo;s the language (or one of the languages)
that the relevant people do speak or should speak in trying to answer
 MQ.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 (The language that these people <em>do</em> speak might be the
relevant <em>public</em> language (e.g., <em>English</em>); or it
might be a special language (which we might call
<em>&ldquo;Ontologese&rdquo;</em>) that&rsquo;s spoken by the
philosophers who are actually debating MQ in print.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given these definitions, we can define the following kind of view:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Type-2 mere-verbalism about a metaphysical question MQ</em> is the
view that (a) there are at least two languages that are <em>initially
relevant to MQ</em>, call them L1 and L2 (there might be more than two
languages that are initially relevant here, but the important thing is
that L1 and L2 are initially relevant to MQ); and (b) in all of these
languages (and, in particular, in both L1 and L2), the answer to MQ is
obvious (or trivial, or some such thing); and (c) in L1, we get one
answer to MQ, and in L2, we get another answer to MQ.</p>

<p>
For example, one could endorse type-2 mere-verbalism about the
temporal-ontology question by claiming that (a) the only two languages
that are even initially relevant to the temporal-ontology question are
Presentese and Eternalese, and (b) sentences like [Dinosaur] are
trivially true in Eternalese and trivially false in Presentese. And if
this were true, it would presumably entail mere-verbalism about the
temporal-ontology question&mdash;i.e., it would entail that there is
no non-verbal (metaphysical) debate to be had about the
temporal-ontology question.</p>

<p>
Mere-verbalism, as it was defined above, doesn&rsquo;t strictly entail
type-2 mere-verbalism; but the two views fit together very well, and
if type-2 mere-verbalism about MQ is true, it seems to more or less
<em>explain why</em> mere-verbalism about MQ is true.</p>

<h4 id="ActMerVer">2.2.3 Actual Mere-Verbalists</h4>

<p>
Other philosophers haven&rsquo;t defined mere-verbalism in the exact
way that it was defined in
 <a href="#MerVerAboMetQue">section 2.2.2</a>.
 But there are numerous philosophers who would endorse mere-verbalist
views&mdash;or something very much like mere-verbalist views&mdash;of
a variety of metaphysical questions. For starters, Carnap (1950) can
be interpreted as endorsing a view of this kind of the abstract-object
question&mdash;and, in particular, the question of whether numbers
exist. For Carnap thinks that (i) in the linguistic framework of
numbers, the sentence &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo; is trivially true
(and, indeed, analytic); and (ii) there are alternative linguistic
frameworks, which we could reasonably employ, in which &lsquo;Numbers
exist&rsquo; is obviously <em>not</em> true.</p>

<p>
(In
 <a href="#ActTri">section 2.1.1</a>,
 we saw that Carnap can be interpreted as endorsing a
<em>trivialist</em> view of the abstract-object question. But
mere-verbalism about a metaphysical question MQ is perfectly
compatible with trivialism about MQ. You can endorse both of these
views by claiming that (a) there are exactly two languages that are
initially relevant to MQ, namely, L1 and L2; and (b) the answer to MQ
is obviously (or trivially) &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in L1 and obviously (or
trivially) &lsquo;No&rsquo; in L2; and (c) L1 is <em>our actual
language</em> (i.e., <em>English</em>), and so trivialism about MQ is
true. Carnaps&rsquo;s view of the abstract-object question is an
example of this. For in addition to endorsing (i) and (ii) from the
preceding paragraph, Carnap also thinks that (iii) the sentence
&lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo; is true (and analytic) in
<em>English</em>.)</p>

<p>
There are other philosophers as well who can be interpreted as
endorsing mere-verbalism (or something very much like that view) about
various metaphysical questions. Perhaps most notably, Hirsch (2002,
2009) endorses views of this kind in connection with the
composite-object question and the perdurantism-vs-endurantism question
(i.e., the question of whether ordinary objects have temporal parts).
In particular, Hirsch endorses a <em>quantifier-variantist</em> view
according to which the word &lsquo;exist&rsquo; (and the quantifier
&lsquo;&exist;&rsquo;) mean different things in the language of the
perdurantist and the language of the endurantist (and in the language
of the mereological nihilist and the language of the person who
believes in composite objects like tables). (We saw in
 <a href="#ActTri">section 2.1.1</a>
 that Hirsch also endorses <em>trivialist</em> views of the
composite-object question and the perdurantism-vs-endurantism
question; but as we just saw, mere-verbalism about a metaphysical
question is compatible with trivialism about that question. And like
Carnap, Hirsch&rsquo;s view is an example of this; he thinks that
debates about the composite-object question and the
perdurantism-vs-endurantism question are merely verbal, but he also
thinks that ordinary English is a composite-object-realist language
and an endurantist language, and so he thinks that, in ordinary
English, endurantism and composite-object realism are (trivially)
true.)</p>

<p>
Like Hirsch, Putnam (1987, 1994), Sidelle (2002, 2007), Button (2013),
Unger (2014), and Warren (2015, 2020, 2022) can all be interpreted as
endorsing mere-verbalist views (or something like mere-verbalist
views) of the composite-object question (and Putnam claims that Carnap
also endorses a view of this kind of the composite-object question).
Moreover, all of these philosophers very likely endorse mere-verbalist
views of various other ontological questions; e.g., Sidelle explicitly
endorses a view of this kind in connection with the coincident-object
question&mdash;i.e., the question of whether there are any such things
as statue-lump-style coincident objects&mdash;and the question of
whether we should endorse mind-brain identity theory or some sort of
functionalist view in the philosophy of mind.</p>

<p>
In addition, Parfit (1995) endorses a mere-verbalist view in
connection with questions of personal identity. And Dennett (2013)
seems to endorse something like mere-verbalism in connection with
various metaphysical questions, although he&rsquo;s not very clear
about which questions he has in mind. He talks mostly about weird
objects like <em>sakes</em> and <em>holes</em>, but perhaps he would
endorse a mere-verbalist view of the question of whether there are any
<em>numbers</em>.</p>

<p>
Sosa (1999), on one reading, endorses something in the ballpark of a
mere-verbalist view of the composite-object question and the
coincident-object question. But one might also read Sosa as endorsing
a realist view of these questions (and of composite objects and
coincident objects).</p>

<p>
Cortens (2000) develops, but doesn&rsquo;t endorse, a general sort of
mere-verbalism about ontological questions, and he interprets Putnam
as endorsing this view.</p>

<p>
Hume (1748) endorses a mere-verbalist view of the free-will question,
and by that, he seems to mean the question of whether human beings
<em>have</em> free will.</p>

<p>
Chalmers (2011) endorses a mere-verbalist view of the question of
whether compatibilism or incompatibilism about free will is true. And
Balaguer (2010) endorses a similar view, although he claims that this
question is more charitably interpreted as being <em>about
meaning</em>. Moreover, in his 2021 book, Balaguer takes this stance
further, arguing that <em>all</em> conceptual-analysis
questions&mdash;e.g., &lsquo;What is free will?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What is
knowledge?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What is a person?&rsquo;, etc.&mdash;are
best interpreted as being about meaning. In particular, on his view,
these questions are about the meanings of the words &lsquo;free
will&rsquo;, &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;person&rsquo;, and so
on.</p>

<p>
Finally, Thomasson (2017) and Belleri (2017) argue that ontological
disputes (e.g., disputes over the existence of composite objects and
abstract objects and 4-dimensional objects and so on) can be thought
of as conceptual-engineering disputes&mdash;or as they put it,
<em>metalinguistic negotiations</em>. Moreover, Carnap (1950) can be
interpreted as endorsing a view of this kind as well. For while Carnap
is a trivialist about what he calls <em>internal</em> questions, he
thinks that what he calls <em>external</em> questions are pragmatic
questions about what language to adopt.</p>

<p>
(Flocke (2021) endorses a kind of anti-realism about ontological
questions that she calls <em>ontological expressivism</em>; according
to this view, ontological sentences like &lsquo;Abstract objects
exist&rsquo; and &lsquo;Composite objects don&rsquo;t exist&rsquo;
express <em>noncognitive mental states</em>. This view is similar in
certain ways to mere-verbalism, but it&rsquo;s also importantly
different.)</p>

<h3 id="NonFac">2.3 Non-Factualism</h3>

<p>
The final kind of local anti-realist view that we will consider can be
defined as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Non-Factualism about a metaphysical question MQ</em> is the view
that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter about the answer to MQ; i.e.,
it&rsquo;s the view that no answer to MQ is true.</p>

<p>
So, e.g., non-factualism about the temporal-ontology question is the
view that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter whether past and future
objects exist. And non-factualism about the composite-object question
is the view that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter whether composite
objects like tables exist. And non-factualism about the
abstract-object question is the view that there&rsquo;s no fact of the
matter whether abstract objects (e.g., numbers or propositions or
whatever) exist.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll see below that there are versions of non-factualism that
are compatible with mere-verbalism. But we&rsquo;ll start by
considering some <em>non-mere-verbalist</em> versions of
non-factualism. These kinds of non-factualism differ from
mere-verbalist views and trivialist views in an important way.
Trivialist and mere-verbalist views (of a metaphysical question MQ)
all imply something like the following claim: <em>In all of the
languages that matter vis-&agrave;-vis MQ, the answer to MQ is
obvious, or trivial, or some such thing</em>. But non-mere-verbalist
non-factualist views of MQ don&rsquo;t imply anything like this; on
the contrary, they imply that the languages that matter the most to MQ
are <em>not trivialist languages</em>&mdash;i.e., they&rsquo;re not
languages in which the answer to MQ is obvious.</p>

<p>
We can define non-mere-verbalist non-factualist views as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Non-Mere-Verbalist Non-Factualism about a metaphysical question
MQ</em> is the view that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter what the
answer to MQ is because, in the language that matters vis-&agrave;-vis
MQ, the sentences that state the competing answers to MQ are so
imprecise that they don&rsquo;t have truth values.</p>

<p>
Consider, e.g., the composite-object question&mdash;and, more
specifically, the question of whether there are any tables.
Non-mere-verbalist non-factualism about this question says that (in
the language that matters vis-&agrave;-vis the composite-object
question) sentences like &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tables
do not exist&rsquo; are so imprecise that they lack determinate truth
values.</p>

<p>
One way to argue for this view would be to argue for the following two
claims: (i) The language that matters vis-&agrave;-vis the
composite-object question is a <em>substantialist</em> language; more
specifically, in this language, the truth of the sentence
&lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; requires there to be an <em>extra
fact</em>, on top of the existence of simples arranged tablewise, and
the truth of the sentence &lsquo;Tables do not exist&rsquo; requires
it to be the case that this alleged extra fact <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
exist; and (ii) it&rsquo;s catastrophically imprecise what the alleged
extra fact could even <em>be</em> (or what the lack of this extra fact
could amount to).</p>

<p>
(Balaguer constructs an argument of this kind in his 2021 book; he
also argues there that (a) if there were a fact of the matter about
whether &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; was true or false in the language
that matters vis-&agrave;-vis the composite-object question, then it
would have to be either a contingent fact or a necessary fact, and (b)
it&rsquo;s neither. Finally, he argues (in his 1998 book, as well as
his 2021 book) for an analogous view of the abstract-object question,
and he suggests (in his 2021 book) that similar arguments can be run
in connection with other metaphysical questions, e.g., the
coincident-object question and the question of whether there are any
non-natural moral facts.)</p>

<p>
A second way to argue for a non-mere-verbalist non-factualist view is
based on the idea that there&rsquo;s nothing that determines whether
the relevant sentences are true, or whether the relevant terms refer.
For instance, in connection with the question of whether there are any
such things as numbers, one might argue as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
(i) The only thing that could determine whether numerals refer (and,
hence, whether numbers exist) is the effect that the referential
success of numerals would have on the truth values of sentences
containing numerals. But (ii) the referential success of numerals
<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have any effect on the truth values of
sentences containing numerals (because the same sentences come out
true and false, regardless of whether numerals refer to numbers).
Therefore, (iii) <em>nothing</em> determines whether numerals
refer&mdash;and, hence, whether numbers exist.</p>

<p>
(Yablo 2009 suggests an argument of this kind. More specifically, he
argues for premise (ii) and tells a just-so story about how premise
(i) could be true&mdash;although he doesn&rsquo;t really argue for
premise (i).)</p>

<p>
A third argument for non-mere-verbalist non-factualist views is based
on the idea that we can distinguish two different quantifiers&mdash;a
<em>lightweight quantifier</em> that&rsquo;s used in ordinary
discourse and a <em>heavyweight quantifier</em> that&rsquo;s used in
ontological debates. Given this, one might argue for
non-mere-verbalist non-factualist views of certain kinds of
ontological questions by saying something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The heavyweight quantifier is <em>defective</em> because we&rsquo;re
free to adopt multiple (distinct) domains of objects as the domain
against which we evaluate ontological claims that are articulated with
the heavyweight quantifier. Thus, if we&rsquo;re speaking the language
of ontology (and, hence, using the heavyweight quantifier), then the
disputed sentences&mdash;e.g., sentences like &lsquo;There are
tables&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t have determinate truth values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Chalmers 2009 endorses a view of this kind in connection with the
composite-object question, the coincident-object question, and the
perdurantism-vs-endurantism
 question.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>)</p>
 
<p>
Finally, a fourth way to argue for non-mere-verbalist non-factualist
views is to argue that ontological questions&mdash;e.g., the
composite-object question and the abstract-object question&mdash;are
non-factual because they suffer from a certain sort of
<em>presupposition failure</em>. More specifically, the idea here is
that (a) these questions presuppose that there are deep metaphysical
facts of a certain kind&mdash;facts that we can&rsquo;t observe
empirically and that would settle our ontological questions; and (b)
there just <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> any such facts. (Warren develops an
argument of this kind in his 2016a
 paper.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In addition to the non-mere-verbalist versions of non-factualism that
we&rsquo;ve been considering so far, there are also mere-verbalist
versions of non-factualism. We can define these views as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Mere-Verbalist Non-Factualism about a metaphysical question
MQ</em> is the view that (a) there are at least two languages that
matter vis-&agrave;-vis MQ, call them L1 and L2 (there might be more
than two languages that matter here, but the important thing is that
L1 and L2 matter); and (b) all of the languages that matter
vis-&agrave;-vis MQ (e.g., L1 and L2) matter to the same
extent&mdash;i.e., none of these languages matters more than any of
the others vis-&agrave;-vis MQ; and (c) in all of these languages
(and, in particular, in both L1 and L2), the answer to MQ is obvious
(or trivial, or some such thing); and (d) in L1, we get one answer to
MQ, and in L2, we get another answer to MQ; and so (e) there&rsquo;s
no fact of the matter about the answer to MQ.</p>

<p>
For example, you could endorse mere-verbalist non-factualism about the
temporal-ontology question by claiming that (a) there are exactly two
languages that matter vis-&agrave;-vis the temporal-ontology question,
namely, Presentese and Eternalese; and (b) neither of these two
languages matters more than the other vis-&agrave;-vis the
temporal-ontology question; and (c) [Dinosaur] is trivially true in
Eternalese and trivially false in Presentese; and so (d) there&rsquo;s
no fact of the matter whether [Dinosaur] is true in <em>the language
that matters</em> vis-&agrave;-vis the temporal-ontology question (and
likewise for other sentences like [Dinosaur]), and so there&rsquo;s no
fact of the matter whether presentism or eternalism is true.</p>

<p>
You might wonder why it would be true that L1 and L2 <em>matter
equally</em> vis-&agrave;-vis MQ. The reason might be that (a)
there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter whether <em>ordinary English</em>
is L1 or L2 (because the linguistic intentions of ordinary folk
aren&rsquo;t robust enough to determine what language they&rsquo;re
speaking). Or the reason might be that (b) there&rsquo;s no fact of
the matter whether <em>the language of the philosophers who are
debating MQ in print</em> is L1 or L2 (because these philosophers
haven&rsquo;t been precise enough about what they mean by their
words). Or the reason might be that (c) L1 and L2 are <em>equally
good</em> in some sense, so that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter
which of these two languages we <em>should</em> use.</p>

<p>
(Many of the mere-verbalists mentioned in
 <a href="#ActMerVer">section 2.2.3</a>
 endorse something like mere-verbalist non-factualism; in particular,
Carnap (1950), Putnam (1987, 1994), Sidelle (2002), Button (2013), and
Parfit (1995) can all be interpreted as endorsing views of this
 kind.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 And Cortens (2000) develops a very general version of this sort of
view, but he doesn&rsquo;t endorse it.)</p>

<h2 id="ObjLocAntReaVie">3. Objections to Local Anti-Realist Views</h2>

<h3 id="ObjMetPri">3.1 The Objection from Metaphysical Privilege</h3>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s begin with an objection to mere-verbalist views, in
particular, quantifier-variantist views (i.e., views that say that
quantifiers like &lsquo;exist&rsquo; and &lsquo;&exist;&rsquo; mean
different things in the languages of the philosophers who endorse
opposing views in connection with ontological
 questions<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>).
 The objection here is based on the idea that while it might be true
that there are multiple candidate meanings of &lsquo;exist&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&exist;&rsquo;, one of these meanings is <em>metaphysically
privileged</em> and, hence, is the one that matters in connection with
ontological questions. One argument for this stance, developed by
Sider (e.g., 2001, 2006, 2009, 2011), can be put in the following
way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The primitive terms of the best overall theory of the world <em>carve
nature at the joints</em>&mdash;i.e., they&rsquo;re <em>natural</em>
terms in something like Lewis&rsquo;s (1983) sense of the term. But
&lsquo;exist&rsquo; (or &lsquo;&exist;&rsquo;) is a primitive term in
our best overall theory of the world, and so we have at least an
initial reason to think that &lsquo;exist&rsquo; is a joint-carving
expression, or a <em>natural</em> expression, and hence that
there&rsquo;s a unique interpretation of
&lsquo;exist&rsquo;&mdash;namely, the joint-carving
interpretation&mdash;that&rsquo;s metaphysically privileged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is an interesting argument, and it can provide certain kinds of
metaphysicians (namely, those who think that the world contains deep
structural facts, or that there are deep &ldquo;joints&rdquo; in
reality) with a background view that justifies a realist view of
ontological questions (in the metaontological sense of
&lsquo;realism&rsquo; outlined in
 <a href="#ReaAntReaAboMetVsReaAntReaMet">section 1</a>).
 But it seems unlikely that this argument will convince any
anti-realists about ontological questions to give up their
anti-realism; for anti-realists are likely to see this argument as
relying on the claim that there are deep metaphysical facts of
precisely the kind that, as anti-realists, they reject.</p>

<h3 id="ObjMaxColArg">3.2 The Objection from Maximalism (and the Collapse Argument)</h3>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s move on now to another objection to mere-verbalist views.
Consider, e.g., mere-verbalism about the composite-object question.
This view says (among other things) that there&rsquo;s a language
(namely, L1) in which, e.g., &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; is obviously
true and another language (namely, L2) in which &lsquo;Tables
exist&rsquo; is obviously false. Given this, we can object to
mere-verbalist non-factualism by saying something like the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; comes out true in L1, then <em>reality
makes it true</em> in L1. But this means that <em>tables exist</em>.
And this means that there&rsquo;s a clear, non-verbal fact of the
matter about whether tables exist&mdash;they <em>do</em>. And this
flies in the face of the mere-verbalist claim that there&rsquo;s no
non-verbal debate to be had about whether tables exist. Moreover,
since mere-verbalism implies that &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; is false
in L2, it seems that this must be because the quantifiers of L2 are
restricted, or something like that. (Arguments of this general kind
have been developed by Hawthorne (2006) and Eklund (2008).)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(It might seem that the move from &ldquo;&lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; is
true in L1&rdquo; to &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; begs the question
against mere-verbalists. But Eklund responds to this by switching to
sentences involving singular terms&mdash;like, e.g., &lsquo;Herbie is
a table&rsquo;. The idea here is that if &lsquo;Herbie is a
table&rsquo; is true in L1, then &lsquo;Herbie&rsquo; has a
referent&mdash;i.e., it refers to a real object that exists in
reality&mdash;and that object is a table.)</p>

<p>
This argument can be used in connection with a wide variety of
ontological questions, and in each case, the conclusion will be that
the mere-verbalist view in question leads to the result that the
<em>maximal-ontology</em> view is correct. E.g., in connection with
the composite-object question, we&rsquo;ll be led to <em>mereological
universalism</em> (i.e., to the view that for any plurality of
physical objects, there&rsquo;s an object that&rsquo;s composed of
those
 objects<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>).
 And in connection with the abstract-object question, we&rsquo;ll be
led to <em>plenitudinous platonism</em> (i.e., to the view that the
platonic realm is a plenitude in which all the abstract objects that
could exist actually do
 exist<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>).
 And in connection with the coincident-object question, we&rsquo;ll be
led to the plenitudinous the view that for any physical object,
there&rsquo;s a plenitude of distinct objects that are coincident with
that object (so, e.g., on this view, there is a massive plenitude of
objects that are coincident with my computer, e.g., a pile of matter,
and a sum of computer parts, and a thing that&rsquo;s essentially on
my table, and so
 on<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>).</p>
 
<p>
Mere-verbalists might respond to this objection by claiming that the
relevant existence claims are <em>trivially</em> true in the
maximalist languages that they have in mind. E.g., in connection with
the abstract-object question, the claim might be that sentences like
&lsquo;There exist numbers&rsquo; are <em>analytic</em>. And in
connection with the composite-object question, the claim might be that
&lsquo;There exist tables&rsquo; is made true by the mere existence of
simples arranged tablewise&mdash;and that the existence of simples
arranged tablewise is obviously true and knowable via quick glances
into dining rooms. And so mere-verbalists might maintain that even if
the relevant existence claim&mdash;i.e., &lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo;, or whatever&mdash;is true in the
maximalist&rsquo;s language, we still have a deflationary,
anti-realist view of the given metaphysical question.</p>

<p>
But while mere-verbalists can surely stipulate that the maximalists
that they have in mind are speaking a language in which these
sentences are trivial, two different problems arise. One&mdash;which
Eklund and Hawthorne both bring out&mdash;is that it&rsquo;s hard to
see how mere-verbalists could provide a compositional semantics for
the maximalist language that they have in mind. E.g., it seems that in
this language, the sentences &lsquo;There are simples&rsquo;,
&lsquo;There are tables&rsquo;, and &lsquo;There are numbers&rsquo;
will all have different logical forms. (For a response to this worry
about compositional semantics, see Hirsch &amp; Warren 2019.)</p>

<p>
The second problem is that while mere-verbalists can stipulatively
create languages at will, their view will ultimately depend on the
claim that the languages that they&rsquo;re talking about are the
languages that <em>matter</em> vis-&agrave;-vis the given metaphysical
question. And that claim might be hard to justify. We will return to
this issue in
 <a href="#ObjSub">section 3.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
(The argument from maximalism that we&rsquo;ve been discussing in this
subsection is similar in spirit to another widely discussed
argument&mdash;namely, the <em>collapse argument against quantifier
variance</em>. The main idea behind the collapse argument is that if
&lsquo;L1&rsquo; and &lsquo;L2&rsquo; are understood in the manner of
the first paragraph of the present subsection, then once we admit that
&lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo;, or
whatever) is true in L1, we&rsquo;ll be able to derive that
&lsquo;Tables exist&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo;, or
whatever) is true in L2&mdash;as long as the word &lsquo;exist&rsquo;
obeys the usual inference rules for existential quantifiers in both L1
and L2&mdash;and this will undermine quantifier-variantist views of
the debate about the existence of tables (or numbers, or whatever). If
this argument is sound, it can be used to undermine
quantifier-variantist views of all ontological disputes. The collapse
argument is based on an argument in Harris (1982); versions of the
argument have been developed by Hale and Wright (2009), Dorr (2014),
and Rossberg (unpublished); and responses have been given by Warren
(2015, 2022) and Sider
 (2023).)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ObjAna">3.3 The Objection from Analyticity</h3>

<p>
The next objection we will consider is an objection against trivialist
views, but it would be very easy to extend the argument so that it was
directed against mere-verbalist views as well. We can put this
objection in the following way:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Trivialists are committed to the claim that certain sentences are
<em>analytic</em>. E.g., in connection with the composite-object
question, they&rsquo;re committed to the claim that sentences like the
following are analytic:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em indent" id="IfTable">
<dt>[If-Table]</dt>
<dd>If there are simples arranged tablewise, then there are
tables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But sentences like this are, in fact, <em>not</em> analytic. For (a)
the consequent of [If-Table] has ontological commitments that the
antecedent doesn&rsquo;t have&mdash;in particular, the table is
supposed to be <em>numerically distinct</em> from the simples
mentioned in the antecedent&mdash;and (b) we can&rsquo;t define
objects into existence. (Bennett 2009 develops an argument of this
kind.)</p>
</div>

<p>
Some trivialists might quibble with the claim that they&rsquo;re
committed to saying that sentences like [If-Table] are analytic; e.g.,
Rayo (2013) might prefer to say that the two sides of [If-Table]
<em>say the same thing</em>, and he might not want to commit to the
claim that they&rsquo;re synonymous. But it seems clear that
trivialists are committed to saying that sentences like [If-Table] are
something <em>like</em> analytic&mdash;e.g., that the two sides of
[If-Table] <em>say the same thing</em>, or some such thing. (And
mere-verbalists are committed to similar claims that leave them
vulnerable to objections of this general kind as well.)</p>

<p>
It seems that trivialists (and mere-verbalists) have to respond to
this argument by rejecting claim (a)&mdash;i.e., by denying that the
consequent of [If-Table] has ontological commitments that the
antecedent doesn&rsquo;t have. And this, it seems, will force them to
say that there&rsquo;s some important sense in which the antecedent
and consequent <em>say the same thing</em>. But, <em>prima facie</em>,
this seems implausible. If we take claim (a) as a claim about
<em>ordinary English</em> (or as a claim about the language
that&rsquo;s just like ordinary English except that it&rsquo;s had the
expression &lsquo;simples arranged tablewise&rsquo; added to it), then
it seems extremely plausible. And it also seems very plausible if we
take claim (a) as a claim about the language that&rsquo;s actually
employed by typical ontological realists who are debating the
composite-object question in print.</p>

<p>
Now, of course, trivialists (and mere-verbalists) could respond to
this by simply stipulating that <em>in the language that they&rsquo;re
talking about</em>, the antecedent and consequent of [If-Table] do not
have different ontological commitments (because they say the same
thing, or because they&rsquo;re synonymous, or some such thing). But
then the same two worries that arose in
 <a href="#ObjMaxColArg">section 3.2</a>
 will reemerge here. First, if trivialists (and mere-verbalists) claim
that the antecedent and consequent of [If-Table] say the same thing,
then it seems that they&rsquo;ll have to give up on
<em>compositionality</em>&mdash;because it seems that they&rsquo;ll
have to say that expressions like &lsquo;there are&rsquo; (and
&lsquo;there exist&rsquo; and &lsquo;&exist;&rsquo; and so on) mean
different things in sentences like &lsquo;There are simples&rsquo; and
&lsquo;There are tables&rsquo; and &lsquo;There are
numbers&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
And second, trivialists and mere-verbalists will have to argue that
the languages that they&rsquo;re talking about here are the languages
that <em>matter</em> vis-&agrave;-vis the relevant metaphysical
questions. And as we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#ObjSub">section 3.4</a>,
 this might be hard to do.</p>

<h3 id="ObjSub">3.4 The Objection from Substantialese</h3>

<p>
Another objection against mere-verbalist views and trivialist views,
developed by Balaguer (2021)&mdash;and for similar but somewhat
different objections, see Dorr (2005) and Sider (2009, 2011)&mdash;can
be put like this:</p>

<p class="indent">
(i) While trivialists and mere-verbalists can easily define languages
in which the answers to our metaphysical questions are obvious (or
trivial, or whatever), in every case, it&rsquo;s easy to define a
language&mdash;what we might call a <em>substantialist
language</em>&mdash;in which the answer to the given metaphysical
question is <em>non</em>-obvious. And (ii) in connection with most
metaphysical questions, the substantialist language is the language
that matters vis-&agrave;-vis the given metaphysical question.</p>

<p>
For example, in connection with the composite-object question, we can
define a language&mdash;call it
<em>Substantialist-Compositese</em>&mdash;in which it&rsquo;s
stipulated that (a) &lsquo;There are tables&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t
follow analytically from &lsquo;There are simples arranged
tablewise&rsquo;, and (b) the truth of &lsquo;There are tables&rsquo;
requires there to be an <em>extra object</em> that&rsquo;s numerically
distinct from the simples that compose it and that exists in a
metaphysically substantive way. And in connection with the
temporal-ontology question, we can define a language&mdash;call it
<em>Substantialist-Temporalese</em>&mdash;in which it&rsquo;s
stipulated that (a) &lsquo;There are dinosaurs&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t
follow analytically from the claim that there used to be dinosaurs;
and (b) this sentence doesn&rsquo;t analytically entail the claim that
dinosaurs exist at the present time, i.e., in the twenty-first
century; and (c) the truth of &lsquo;There are dinosaurs&rsquo;
requires it to be the case that reality is a 4-dimensional block in
which dinosaurs exist (in a metaphysically substantive eternalist way)
in a past region of a 4-dimensional spatiotemporal block. And in
connection with the abstract-object question, we can define a
language&mdash;call it <em>Substantialist-Platonese</em>&mdash;in
which it&rsquo;s stipulated that (a) &lsquo;There are numbers&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t analytic, and (b) the truth of &lsquo;There are
numbers&rsquo; requires it to be the case that there are non-physical,
non-mental, non-spatiotemporal objects that exist in a metaphysically
substantive platonistic way. And so on.</p>

<p>
In connection with just about all of our metaphysical questions, it
seems, <em>prima facie</em>, that substantialist languages of this
kind are the languages that matter vis-&agrave;-vis the relevant
metaphysical questions. Balaguer supports this claim by arguing that
(i) natural languages like English are best thought of as
substantialist languages, not trivialist languages; and (ii) even if
(i) isn&rsquo;t true, mainstream philosophers who are actually
debating the relevant metaphysical questions in print are best thought
of as speaking substantialist languages rather than trivialist
languages; and, most importantly, (iii) even if (i) and (ii) were both
false&mdash;i.e., even if ordinary folk and mainstream metaphysicians
were best interpreted as speaking trivialist
languages&mdash;substantialist languages would still be the languages
that matter vis-&agrave;-vis our metaphysical questions. The argument
for claim (iii) is based on the fact that (a) if we debate our
metaphysical questions in substantialist languages, then we get
questions of the kind that we&rsquo;re <em>trying</em> to ask, namely,
substantive non-obvious metaphysical questions; and (b) if we debate
our metaphysical questions in trivialist languages, then we get
trivial, boring questions about things like whether there&rsquo;s
anything in the dining room that will keep our dinner from falling to
the ground (in the composite-object debate), and whether dinosaurs are
extinct (in the temporal-ontology debate), and how many witches there
are in Salem, Massachusetts (in the abstract-object debate).</p>

<p>
One way to respond to this argument would be to claim that
substantialist languages of the above kind are, in some sense, <em>not
possible</em>&mdash;that we <em>can&rsquo;t</em> speak these
languages. But this might be hard to justify because, intuitively, it
seems that we <em>can</em> speak these languages&mdash;that it&rsquo;s
at least <em>possible</em> for us to debate our metaphysical questions
in substantialist languages of this kind. And if trivialists and
mere-verbalists admit that this is possible, then it&rsquo;s hard to
see how they could plausibly deny that these substantialist languages
<em>matter</em> vis-&agrave;-vis our metaphysical questions; for it
would seem rather odd to maintain that (a) if we wanted to, we could
have a substantive debate about a metaphysical question MQ by speaking
the language <em>L</em>, but (b) this doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;we
should stick to a trivialist language in which the answer to MQ is
trivial.</p>

<p>
Trivialists and mere-verbalists might try to motivate this stance by
arguing that substantialist languages of the kind at issue here are
<em>imprecise</em>&mdash;so imprecise that (a) the disputed sentences
don&rsquo;t have truth values in these languages, and (b)
there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter about the answers to our
metaphysical questions in these languages. One might argue,
however&mdash;and, in fact, Balaguer does argue&mdash;that even if
substantialist languages are imprecise in this way, they&rsquo;re
<em>still</em> the languages that matter vis-&agrave;-vis our
metaphysical questions. But, of course, trivialists and
mere-verbalists might deny this.</p>

<h3 id="ProMisSecLanUnmMerVerReaEndAntReaMet">3.5 The Problem of the Missing Second Language (and Unmasking Mere-Verbalists as Really Endorsing Anti-Realism <em>In</em> Metaphysics)</h3>

<p>
Another objection to mere-verbalist views is based on the observation
that it&rsquo;s often very difficult to figure out what the two
languages are supposed to be. For instance, in connection with the
composite-object question, one language will be the language of
Thomasson-style trivialists. In this language, the existence of
simples arranged tablewise is already sufficient for the truth of
&lsquo;There exist tables&rsquo;, and so that sentence comes out
trivially true. But what is the language in which &lsquo;There exist
tables&rsquo; comes out trivially <em>false</em>? It&rsquo;s not clear
that there&rsquo;s any plausible answer to this question.</p>

<p>
Bennett (2009) develops a version of this worry and suggests that
mere-verbalists might claim that the second language here is a
language in which &lsquo;There exist tables&rsquo; is equivalent to
the following sentence:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent" id="SenT">
<dt>[T]</dt>
<dd>There are regions in which (a) there is a plurality of simples
arranged tablewise, and (b) there is also an <em>extra object</em>
that&rsquo;s numerically distinct from the simples arranged
tablewise.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But, as Bennett points out, it&rsquo;s not clear that mereological
nihilists mean to be speaking a language in which &lsquo;There exist
tables&rsquo; is equivalent to [T]. Moreover&mdash;and more
importantly&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to see why we should think that
 <a href="#SenT">[T]</a>
 is <em>trivially false</em>. This would presumably be denied by
anyone who thinks that the composite-object question is an important
non-obvious question about the metaphysical nature of reality. In
other words, <em>realists about the composite-object question</em>
would presumably deny that [T] is trivially false. And so any language
in which &lsquo;There exist tables&rsquo; is equivalent to [T]
isn&rsquo;t a language of the kind that mere-verbalists need.</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s also a second objection to mere-verbalist views
that&rsquo;s lurking in the background here. If mere-verbalists do
claim that the nihilist&rsquo;s language is a language in which
&lsquo;There exist tables&rsquo; is equivalent to
 <a href="#SenT">[T]</a>&mdash;and
 it&rsquo;s hard to see what other language they could take to be the
nihilist&rsquo;s
 language<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>&mdash;then
 since mere-verbalists are committed to saying that &lsquo;There exist
tables&rsquo; is false in the nihilist&rsquo;s language, they&rsquo;ll
also have to say that [T] is false. But [T] just seems to be an
articulation of a metaphysically robust version of realism about
composite objects like tables. Thus, if mere-verbalists about the
composite-object question say that [T] is false, then it seems that
they&rsquo;re really just <em>nihilists</em>&mdash;i.e., it seems that
they just reject the existence of substantive composite objects. And
that seems incompatible with the whole spirit of mere-verbalism.</p>

<p>
If this argument can be generalized to other ontological
questions&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not clear how far it can be
 generalized<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>&mdash;then
 it seems that mere-verbalists are really just anti-realists about
objects of the kinds that our ontological questions are about. In
other words, while mere-verbalists claim to be anti-realists <em>about
our ontological questions</em>, if the argument under discussion here
is correct, then mere-verbalists are unmasked as really being
anti-realists about the <em>objects</em> that our ontological
questions are about. Or to put the point into the lingo of
 <a href="#ReaAntReaAboMetVsReaAntReaMet">section 1</a>,
 the claim here is that mere-verbalists are unmasked as really being
anti-realists <em>in</em> metaphysics, rather than anti-realists
<em>about</em> metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Dorr (2005) runs an argument that&rsquo;s somewhat similar to this but
also importantly different. In particular, Dorr argues that (a)
ontological questions are best thought of as being debated in a
special language in which semantically defective predicates are to be
replaced with logically contradictory predicates; and (b) the
two-place predicate &lsquo;is a proper part of&rsquo; is semantically
defective, and so in the language of ontology, nihilism (i.e., the
view that there are no objects with proper parts) is true; and (c)
mere-verbalists (and various other kinds of anti-realists about the
composite-object question) should say that &lsquo;is a proper part
of&rsquo; is semantically defective, and so they are
&ldquo;unmasked&rdquo; as really being nihilists.</p>

<p>
One might reasonably think that similar remarks can be made about
<em>trivialists</em>&mdash;i.e., that trivialists about the
composite-object question can be thought of as &ldquo;nihilists in
disguise&rdquo;, and that trivialists about the abstract-object
question can be thought of as &ldquo;anti-platonists in
disguise&rdquo;, and so on. At first glance, this might seem odd
because trivialists claim to endorse the existence of objects of these
kinds&mdash;i.e., they claim that sentences like &lsquo;There are
tables&rsquo; and &lsquo;There are numbers&rsquo; are <em>true</em>.
But it&rsquo;s hard to resist the feeling that trivialists are engaged
in a kind of &ldquo;false advertising&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s hard to
resist the feeling that trivialists don&rsquo;t really believe in
objects of the kinds that are under dispute among ontological
realists&mdash;i.e., among philosophers who endorse realist views of
our ontological questions. In other words, it&rsquo;s hard to resist
the feeling that trivialists don&rsquo;t believe in the existence of
full-blown (i.e., metaphysically substantive) abstract objects or
full-blown composite objects.</p>

<h3 id="ProMetEqu">3.6 The Problem of Metaphysical Equivalence</h3>

<p>
Consider the following pair or sentences:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt id="SenU">[U]</dt>
<dd>There&rsquo;s a table in Beth&rsquo;s dining room.</dd>
<dt id="SenN">[N]</dt>
<dd>There are simples arranged tablewise in Beth&rsquo;s dining
room.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These two sentences seem to give us different descriptions of reality.
But mere-verbalists (and, in particular, quantifier variantists) seem
to be committed to saying that if a mereological universalist utters
[U] and a nihilist utters [N], then they&rsquo;ve <em>said the same
thing about reality</em>, or they&rsquo;ve <em>painted equivalent
pictures of reality</em>. Put differently, quantifier variantists seem
committed to saying that these two utterances are <em>metaphysically
equivalent</em>.</p>

<p>
Given this, one might argue against mere-verbalist (and, in
particular, quantifier-variantist) views by arguing that [U] and [N]
are <em>not</em> metaphysically equivalent, or that we don&rsquo;t
have any good reason to believe that they&rsquo;re metaphysically
equivalent. (McSweeney 2016 constructs an argument of this kind. In
particular, she argues that in order for us to be justified in
believing that two theories T1 and T2 are metaphysically equivalent,
there needs to be some perspective from which we can conceive of T1
and T2 as giving us a single unified theory, T+, that says everything
that T1 and T2 say individually and nothing more. And then she raises
doubts about whether we have such a perspective in connection with the
pairs of theories that quantifier variantists think are
equivalent.)</p>

<p>
Intuitively, it seems that pairs of theories&mdash;or, more
importantly, pairs of <em>utterances</em>&mdash;of the kind in
question here <em>are</em> equivalent. Now, if you&rsquo;re thinking
of <em>English</em>, this claim might be surprising. For in English,
pairs of sentences like [U] and [N] don&rsquo;t seem to be equivalent.
But that&rsquo;s not what matters here. What matters is whether the
<em>Universalese</em> sentence [U] (where Universalese is the language
that mere-verbalists think that compositional universalists speak) is
equivalent to the <em>Nihilese</em> sentence [N] (where Nihilese is
the language that mere-verbalists think that compositional nihilists
speak). And it seems that once we learn to speak Nihilese and
Universalese, it becomes very intuitive to think that these two
sentences are equivalent. This is because, in Universalese, the fact
that makes [N] true&mdash;i.e., the existence of simples arranged
tablewise in Beth&rsquo;s dining room&mdash;is already sufficient for
the truth of [U]. And so it seems that in order to undermine
mere-verbalist views with an argument of the above kind, you would
need to argue that we don&rsquo;t understand these two languages as
well as we seem to. (In McSweeney&rsquo;s lingo, the claim here is as
follows: the fact that the above two sentences seem intuitively
equivalent to us suggests that we <em>do have</em> a perspective from
which we can conceive of them as giving us a single unified
theory.)</p>

<h2 id="GloAntReaVie">4. Global Anti-Realist Views</h2>

<p>
This entry has been focused on <em>local</em> kinds of
anti-realism&mdash;i.e., on anti-realist views of <em>specific</em>
metaphysical questions, like the abstract-object question and the
composite-object question. But it&rsquo;s important to note that there
are also some more global anti-realist views in the literature. As was
pointed out at the start of the entry, Wittgenstein (1921, 1953) and
the logical positivists (e.g., the early Carnap 1928, 1934) offered
very general critiques of metaphysics. But those critiques are largely
believed to have failed for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most
important reason is that these views are thought to be
<em>self-refuting</em>; in other words, the arguments that these
philosophers gave against metaphysics seemed to refute their own
anti-metaphysical views.</p>

<p>
We won&rsquo;t consider the critiques of Wittgenstein and the logical
positivists&mdash;for more on their views, see the entries on
 <a href="../wittgenstein/">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>
 and
 <a href="../logical-empiricism/">logical empiricism</a><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>&mdash;but
 in this section, we will briefly consider some critiques of
metaphysics that have been put forward recently that are more general
than the local sorts of critiques considered in
 <a href="#LocAntReaVie">section 2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
One sort of view here might be called <em>global anti-metaphysical
scientism</em>. Views of this kind say that we can get all the
metaphysics that we need from science, or that we shouldn&rsquo;t
endorse any metaphysical claims that go beyond what the sciences say,
or something along these lines. (Views in this general vicinity have
been endorsed by van Fraassen (2002), Maudlin (2007), and Ismael
(2013). Ladyman and Ross (2007) endorse a similar view; they argue
that the only legitimate kind of metaphysics is aimed at explaining
how multiple scientific theories can be <em>unified</em>.)</p>

<p>
A second way to develop a more general variety of anti-realism is to
argue for a <em>general trivialist</em> view of ontological questions.
There are multiple versions of this kind of view. One version,
developed by Thomasson (2015), is based on the idea that once we get
clear on the meanings and truth conditions of certain kinds of
sentences, it becomes clear that the kinds of questions that are
typically asked by ontologists are <em>easily
answerable</em>&mdash;either conceptually (as in the case of the
question of whether there any numbers) or via easy empirical
experiments (as in the case of the question of whether there are any
tables, which can be answered by simply looking into certain dining
rooms). A second version of general trivialism about ontological
questions, developed by Hofweber (2016), is based on a distinction
between two kinds of quantifiers&mdash;one that&rsquo;s existentially
loaded (the external quantifier) and one that&rsquo;s not
existentially loaded (the internal quantifier). Somewhat roughly, the
view here is that for just about any predicate F, (i) if the
quantifiers associated with our talk of Fs are <em>internal</em>, then
the sentence &lsquo;Fs exist&rsquo; is trivially true when
&lsquo;exist&rsquo; is read internally, and it&rsquo;s trivially false
when &lsquo;exist&rsquo; is read externally; and (ii) if the
quantifiers associated with our talk of Fs are <em>external</em>, then
the question of whether there are any Fs is trivially settled by our
empirical scientific theories. For example, on Hofweber&rsquo;s view,
the quantifiers associated with our talk of <em>numbers</em> are
internal, and so &lsquo;Numbers exist&rsquo; is trivially true in the
internal sense and trivially false in the external sense; and the
quantifiers associated with our talk of ordinary objects like
<em>rocks</em> are external, and the claim that things like rocks
exist follows immediately from our empirical theories.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth noting that neither of these versions of general
trivialism is supposed to be <em>entirely</em> general. On
Thomasson&rsquo;s version of the view, there are some existence
questions that are difficult to answer because they&rsquo;re
<em>conceptually</em> or <em>empirically</em> difficult; e.g., it
might be conceptually difficult to determine whether there&rsquo;s a
largest pair of twin primes, and it might be empirically difficult to
determine whether there are planets with moons orbiting Alpha Centauri
A. And similar remarks can be made about Hofweber&rsquo;s version of
the view. Moreover, even if we limit our attention to the kinds of
ontological questions that <em>metaphysicians</em> ask, the view still
isn&rsquo;t entirely general; for it&rsquo;s compatible with the claim
that some of these questions (e.g., &lsquo;Does God exist?&rsquo;) are
<em>not</em> trivial.</p>

<p>
(It seems likely that some of the trivialists and mere-verbalists
discussed in
 <a href="#LocAntReaVie">section 2</a>
 would endorse very general trivialist views as well. In particular,
it seems that Carnap (1950) and Rayo (2013) would endorse very general
trivialist views of ontological questions. And Cortens (2000) develops
view that&rsquo;s similar but also a bit different&mdash;it&rsquo;s
better thought of as a general version of mere-verbalist
non-factualism. Cortens interprets Putnam as endorsing this view, but
he doesn&rsquo;t endorse it himself. Finally, Unger (2014) seems to
endorse a general version of mere-verbalism as well. But Hirsch (2002,
2009) would not endorse as general a view as some of these other
philosophers; he endorses trivialist/mere-verbalist views of numerous
ontological questions, but he doesn&rsquo;t endorse a view of this
kind of the abstract-object question.)</p>

<p>
A third very global kind of anti-realism, developed by Balaguer
(2021), can be called <em>neo-positivism</em>. Very roughly, glossing
over some details, neo-positivism is the view that for any
metaphysical question MQ, either (a) a non-mere-verbalist
non-factualism is true of MQ, or (b) a local anti-metaphysical sort of
scientism is true of MQ (i.e., very roughly, MQ is an ordinary
empirical question about physical reality, and we can&rsquo;t make any
substantive progress on MQ by using philosophical arguments). For
example, Balaguer argues for non-mere-verbalist non-factualist views
of the composite-object question and the abstract-object question (and
he suggests that similar arguments can be run in connection with the
coincident-object question and the non-natural-moral-fact question);
and he argues for local anti-metaphysical scientistic views of
conceptual-analysis questions, the question of whether we have free
will, the question of whether mind-brain materialism is true, and the
question of whether God exists.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that at least some of these more recent
views fare better with respect to self-refutation worries than earlier
versions of global anti-realism do&mdash;in particular, they fare
better than the views of Wittgenstein and the logical positivists do.
For example, the general trivialist views of Thomasson and Hofweber
aren&rsquo;t self-refuting because (a) these views are about
<em>ontological questions only</em>, and (b) these views aren&rsquo;t
themselves ontological claims. And Balaguer&rsquo;s neo-positivism
isn&rsquo;t self-refuting because neo-positivists can endorse
anti-metaphysical scientism about the question of whether
neo-positivism is true; more specifically, they can take
neo-positivism to be an empirical hypothesis about the actual
metaphysical questions that are debated in print by actual
metaphysicians; and they can claim that the argument for
neo-positivism is a piecemeal inductive argument based on specific
arguments for neo-positivist views of specific metaphysical <span  class="nw">questions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup></span></p>
 
<p>
On the other hand, it&rsquo;s not clear that advocates of global
anti-metaphysical scientism can avoid the worry of self-refutation.
Perhaps they could argue that our scientific theories imply (or
suggest, or some such thing) that we should be anti-realists about
metaphysical theorizing that goes beyond what the sciences tell us;
but it is far from clear that this is true.</p>

<p>
Similar remarks can be made about the &ldquo;just-more-metaphysics
worry&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., the worry that anti-metaphysical views
don&rsquo;t succeed in getting rid of metaphysics because they are
<em>themselves</em> metaphysical theories. This isn&rsquo;t a serious
problem for general trivialism or neo-positivism; for advocates of
those views can just grant that their theories are metaphysical
theories, and they can simply deny that they&rsquo;re trying to get
rid of metaphysics altogether. Since general trivialist theories are
about <em>ontology only</em>&mdash;and since these theories
aren&rsquo;t <em>themselves</em> ontological theories&mdash;advocates
of these theories can simply claim that their theories belong to a
part of metaphysics that doesn&rsquo;t concern ontology. And advocates
of neo-positivism can say (and, indeed, Balaguer does say) that
neo-positivism is a metaphysical theory but that we can endorse
anti-metaphysical scientism (and, hence, neo-positivism) about the
question of whether neo-positivism is true.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s less obvious, however, that advocates of global
anti-metaphysical scientism can shrug off the worry that their
theories are metaphysical theories. For it&rsquo;s not obvious that
our scientific theories imply that global anti-metaphysical scientism
is
 true.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup></p>
