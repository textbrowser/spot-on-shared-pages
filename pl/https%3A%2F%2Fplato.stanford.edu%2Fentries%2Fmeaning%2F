<h1>Theories of Meaning</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jan 26, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jul 31, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The term &ldquo;theory of meaning&rdquo; has figured, in one way or
another, in a great number of philosophical disputes over the last
century. Unfortunately, this term has also been used to mean a great
number of different things. In this entry, the focus is on two sorts
of &ldquo;theory of meaning&rdquo;. The first sort of theory&mdash;a
semantic theory&mdash;is a theory which assigns semantic contents to
expressions of a language. The second sort of theory&mdash;a
metasemantic theory&mdash;is a theory which states the facts in virtue
of which expressions have the semantic contents that they have.
Following a brief introduction, these two kinds of theory are
discussed in turn.</p>

<h2 id="TwoKindTheoMean">1. Two Kinds of Theory of Meaning</h2>

<p>
In &ldquo;General Semantics&rdquo;, David Lewis wrote</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I distinguish two topics: first, the description of possible languages
or grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are
associated with aspects of the world; and, second, the description of
the psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of
these abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or
population. Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. (Lewis
1970: 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis was right. Even if philosophers have not consistently kept these
two questions separate, there clearly is a distinction between the
questions &ldquo;What is the meaning of this or that symbol (for a
particular person or group)?&rdquo; and &ldquo;In virtue of what facts
about that person or group does the symbol have that
meaning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Corresponding to these two questions are two different sorts of theory
of meaning. One sort of theory of meaning&mdash;a <em>semantic
theory</em>&mdash;is a specification of the meanings of the words and
sentences of some symbol system. Semantic theories thus answer the
question, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this or that
expression?&rdquo; A distinct sort of theory&mdash;a <em>metasemantic
theory</em>&mdash;tries to explain what about some person or group
gives the symbols of their language the meanings that they have.
(Metasemantic theories are also sometimes called &ldquo;foundational
theories of meaning&rdquo; or a &ldquo;metaphysics of meaning.&rdquo;) To be sure, the
shape of a correct semantic theory places constraints on the correct
metasemantics, and vice versa; but that does not change the fact that
semantic theories and metasemantic theories are simply different sorts
of theories, designed to answer different questions.</p>

<p>
To see the distinction between semantic theories and metasemantic
theories, it may help to consider an analogous one. Imagine a social
anthropologist interested in table manners sent out to observe a
distant community. One task the anthropologist clearly might undertake
is to simply describe the table manners of that community&mdash;to
describe the different categories into which members of the community
place actions at the table, and to say which sorts of actions fall
into which categories. This would be analogous to the task of the
philosopher of language interested in semantics; their job is say what
different sorts of meanings expressions of a given language have, and
which expressions have which meanings.</p>

<p>
But our anthropologist might also become interested in the nature of
manners; they might wonder how, in general, one set of rules of table
manners comes to be the system of etiquette governing a particular
group. Since presumably the fact that a group obeys one system of
etiquette rather than another is traceable to something about that
group, the anthropologist might put his new question by asking,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In virtue of what facts about a person or group does that person or
group come to be governed by a particular system of etiquette, rather
than another?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our anthropologist would then have embarked upon the analogue of the
construction of a metasemantic theory: they would then be interested,
not in which etiquette-related properties particular action types have
in a certain group, but rather the question of how action-types can,
in any group, come to acquire properties of this
 sort.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Our anthropologist might well be interested in both sorts of
questions about table manners; but they are, pretty clearly, different
questions. Just so, semantic theories and metasemantic theories are,
pretty clearly, different sorts of theories.</p>

<p>
The term &ldquo;theory of meaning&rdquo; has, in the recent history of
philosophy, been used to stand for both semantic theories and
metasemantic theories. As this has obvious potential to mislead, in
what follows I&rsquo;ll stick instead to the more specific
&ldquo;semantic theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;metasemantic
 theory&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This entry focuses on the meanings of expressions of natural
languages. But the expressions of natural languages are not the only
things to which meanings are attributed. Philosophers often also talk
about the meaning, or content, of mental representations. We also talk
about the meanings of pictures, maps, and other non-linguistic
representations. In either domain, we could make a distinction
parallel to our distinction between semantic and metasemantic
theories. While there are interesting connections between theories of
meaning in our senses and these topics, for reasons of space these
topics are not addressed in what follows. For discussions of these
topics, see the entries on
 <a href="../mental-representation/">mental representation</a>
 and
 <a href="../depiction/">depiction</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There is one other use of &ldquo;theory of meaning&rdquo; worth mentioning, which
is perhaps most often used in connection with verificationism. The
verificationist theory of meaning is the theory that a sentence is
meaningful if and only if it is (in a sense to be specified by the
theory) verifiable as true or false on the basis of experience. This
does not answer the questions to which either semantic or metasemantic
theories are addressed; it neither tells us what the meanings of
sentences are nor tells us the facts in virtue of which they have
those meanings. Instead, it is what we might call a &ldquo;theory of
meaningfulness&rdquo;; it gives the conditions under which a sentence is
meaningful. If the verificationist theory, or some other such theory
of meaningfulness, were true, this would provide a constraint which
the correct semantic and metasemantic theories would have to meet. I
set theories of meaningfulness aside in what follows. For more on the
history of verificationism, see the entry on
 <a href="../logical-empiricism/">logical empiricism</a>.</p>
 
<p>
This entry covers a lot of ground, and is quite long. However, many
parts can be read independently of each other. A reader interested
just in getting a sense of how one standard approach to natural
language semantics works can read only &sect;2.1. Readers interested
in getting a brief introduction to one or another of the alternatives
to this standard approach to semantics can read the corresponding
subsections of &sect;2.2 on their own. Likewise, the introductions of
general issues in semantics in &sect;2.3 &ndash; context-sensitivity,
relativism, and theories of propositions &ndash; can all be read on
their own. And the discussions of various approaches to metasemantics
in &sect;3 can all be read independently of each other and
independently of the discussion of semantics in &sect;2.</p>

<h2 id="SemaTheo">2. Semantic Theories</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this section is to lay out the main approaches to
constructing a semantic theory for natural languages. These theories
agree that there is some way of assigning meanings to the parts of
sentences from which the meanings of sentences can be derived; they
disagree on what this assignment looks like. But before we get into
the disagreements: why think that there is any true theory of this
sort to be discovered?</p>

<p>
The standard answer to this question focuses on a fact about our
understanding of language, and goes back at least to Frege:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the possibility of our understanding sentences which we have never
heard before rests evidently on this, that we can construct the sense
of a sentence out of parts that correspond to words. (Frege
[1914/1980]: 79)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are all able to understand sentences which we have never
encountered before. How do we manage to do this? A natural answer is
that we are able to do this because we understand the meanings of the
words out of which these new sentences are formed, and understand the
way in which those words are combined in the new sentences. But then
it seems that there must be some way of deriving the meanings of
sentences from the meanings of the words of which they are composed
plus the facts about the ways in which those words are combined. But
this way of deriving the meanings of sentences is just what a semantic
theory aims to provide; so there must be some true semantic theory to
be found. A semantic theory which respects the principle that the
meanings of sentences are derived from the meanings of words plus the
way in which those words are combined is called a
&lsquo;compositional&rsquo; semantic theory. For discussion of
different versions of this principle and arguments for and against the
existence of a true compositional semantic theory, see the entry on
compositionality.</p>

<p>
No two languages have the same semantics; no two languages are
comprised of just the same words, with just the same meanings. Given
this, it may seem hard to see how we can say anything about semantic
theories in general, as opposed to the semantics of this or that
language. While it is of course correct that the semantics for English
is one thing and the semantics for French something else, most assume
that the various natural languages should all have semantic theories
of (in a sense to be explained) the same form. The aim of what follows
will, accordingly, be to introduce the reader to the main approaches
to natural language semantics&mdash;the main views about the right
form for a semantics for a natural language to take&mdash;rather than
to provide a detailed examination of the various views about the
semantics of some particular expression. (For an overview, see the
entry on
 <a href="../word-meaning/">word meaning</a>.
 For discussion of issues involving particular expression types, see
the entries on
 <a href="../names/">names</a>,
 <a href="../quantification/">quantifiers and quantification</a>,
 <a href="../descriptions/">descriptions</a>,
 <a href="../prop-attitude-reports/">propositional attitude reports</a>, and
 <a href="../natural-kinds/">natural kinds</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Before a semantic theorist sets off to explain the meanings of the
expressions of some language, she needs a clear idea of what she is
supposed to explain the meaning <em>of</em>. This might not seem to
present much of a problem; aren&rsquo;t the bearers of meaning just
the sentences of the relevant language, and their parts? This is
correct as far as it goes. But the task of explaining what the
semantically significant parts of a sentence are, and how those parts
combine to form the sentence, is as complex as semantics itself, and
has important consequences for semantic theory. Indeed, most disputes
about the right semantic treatment of some class of expressions are
intertwined with questions about the syntax of sentences in which
those expressions figure. Discussion of theories of this sort, which
attempt to explain the syntax, or logical form, of natural language
sentences, is well beyond the scope of this entry. As a result,
figures like Richard Montague, whose work on syntax and its connection
to semantics has been central to the development of semantic theory,
are passed over in what follows. (Montague&rsquo;s essays are
collected in Montague 1974.) For an introduction to the connections
between syntax and semantics, see Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998); for an
overview of the relations between philosophy of language and several
branches of linguistics, see Moss (2012).</p>

<p>
There are a wide variety of approaches to natural language semantics.
My strategy in what follows will be to begin by explaining one
prominent family of approaches to semantics which developed over the
course of the twentieth century and is still prominently represented
in contemporary work in semantics, both in linguistics and in
philosophy. For lack of a better term, I&rsquo;ll call these types of
semantic theories <em>classical semantic theories</em>. (As in
discussions of classical logic, the appellation
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; is not meant to suggest that theories to which
this label is applied are to be preferred over others.) Classical
semantic theories agree that sentences are (typically) true or false,
and that whether they are true or false depends on what information
they encode or express. This &ldquo;information&rdquo; is often called
&ldquo;the proposition expressed by the sentence&rdquo;. The job of a
semantic theory, according to the classical theorist, is at least in
large part to explain how the meanings of the parts of the sentence,
along with the context in which the sentence is used, combine to
determine which proposition the sentence expresses in that context
(and hence also the truth conditions of the sentence, as used in that
context).</p>

<p>
Classical semantic theories are discussed in
 <a href="#ClasSemaTheo">&sect;2.1</a>.
 In
 <a href="#TheoRefe">&sect;&sect;2.1.1&ndash;4</a>
 the theoretical framework common to classical semantic theories is
explained; in
 <a href="#PossWorlSema">&sect;&sect;2.1.5&ndash;7</a>
 the differences between three main versions of classical semantic
theories are explained. In
 <a href="#AlteClasSemaTheo">&sect;2.2</a>
 there is a discussion of the alternatives to classical semantic
theories. In
 <a href="#GeneQuesFaciSemaTheo">&sect;2.3</a>
 a few general concluding questions are discussed; these are questions
semantic theorists face which are largely, though not completely,
orthogonal to one&rsquo;s view about the form which a semantic theory
ought to take.</p>

<h3 id="ClasSemaTheo">2.1 Classical Semantic Theories</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to understand the various sorts of classical semantic
theories is by beginning with another sort of theory: a theory of
reference.</p>

<h4 id="TheoRefe">2.1.1 The theory of reference</h4>

<p>
A theory of reference is a theory which pairs expressions with the
contribution those expressions make to the determination of the
truth-values of sentences in which they occur. (Though later we will
see that this view of the reference of an expression must be
restricted in certain ways.)</p>

<p>
This construal of the theory of reference is traceable to
 <a href="../frege/">Gottlob Frege</a>&rsquo;s
 attempt to formulate a logic sufficient for the formalization of
mathematical inferences (see especially Frege 1879 and 1892a.) The
construction of a theory of reference of this kind is best illustrated
by beginning with the example of proper names. Consider the following
sentences:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li id="ex1-bop"><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen"> Barack
Obama was the 44th president of the United States.</span></li>

<li id="ex2-jmp"><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen"> John
McCain was the 44th president of the United States.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(1) is true, and (2) is false. Obviously, this difference in
truth-value is traceable to some difference between the expressions
&ldquo;Barack Obama&rdquo; and &ldquo;John McCain&rdquo;. What about
these expressions explains the difference in truth-value between these
sentences? It is very plausible that it is the fact that &ldquo;Barack
Obama&rdquo; stands for the man who was in fact the 44th president of
the United States, whereas &ldquo;John McCain&rdquo; stands for a man
who was not. This suggests that the reference of a proper
name&mdash;its contribution to the determination of truth conditions
of sentences in which it occurs&mdash;is the object for which that
name stands. (While this is plausible, it is not uncontroversial that
the purpose of a name is to refer to an individual; see Fara (2015)
and Jeshion (2015) for arguments on opposite sides of this issue.)</p>

<p>
Given this starting point, it is a short step to some conclusions
about the reference of other sorts of expressions. Consider the
following pair of sentences:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li id="ex3-bod"><span class="tag">(3)</span><span class="sen"> Barack
Obama is a Democrat.</span></li>

<li id="ex4-bor"><span class="tag">(4)</span><span class="sen"> Barack
Obama is a Republican.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Again, the first of these is true, whereas the second is false. We
already know that the reference of &ldquo;Barack Obama&rdquo; is the
man for which the name stands; so, given that reference is power to
affect truth-value, we know that the reference of verb phrases like
&ldquo;is a Democrat&rdquo; and &ldquo;is a Republican&rdquo; must be
something which combines with an object to yield a truth-value.
Accordingly, it is natural to think of the reference of verb phrases
of this sort as functions from objects to truth-values. The reference
of &ldquo;is a Democrat&rdquo; is that function which returns the
truth-value &ldquo;true&rdquo; when given as input an object which is
a member of the Democratic party (and the truth-value
&ldquo;false&rdquo; otherwise), whereas the reference of &ldquo;is a
Republican&rdquo; is a function which returns the truth-value
&ldquo;true&rdquo; when given as input an object which is a member of
the Republican party (and the truth-value &ldquo;false&rdquo;
otherwise). This is what explains the fact that (3) is true and (4)
false: Obama is a member of the Democratic party, and is not a member
of the Republican party.</p>

<p>
Matters get more complicated, and more controversial, as we extend
this sort of theory of reference to cover more and more of the types
of expressions we find in natural languages like English. (For an
introduction, see Heim and Kratzer (1998) or Chierchia &amp;
McConnell-Ginet (1990).) But the above is enough to give a rough idea
of how one might proceed. Consider, for example, adverbs. These seem
to combine with verb phrases to form new verb phrases. If so, the
reference of an adverb must be something which combines with the
reference of a verb phrase to yield the reference of a verb phrase
&ndash; so, a function from functions from objects to truth-values to
functions from objects to truth-values. Or consider a sentence
connective like &lsquo;and.&rsquo; This seems to combine with a pair
of sentences to form a sentence. If so, the reference of a sentence
connective must be something which combines with the references of a
pair of sentences to a truth-value &ndash; so, a function from a pair
of truth-values to a truth-value.</p>

<h4 id="TheoRefeVsSemaTheo">2.1.2 Theories of reference vs. semantic theories</h4>

<p>
So let&rsquo;s suppose that we have a theory of reference for a
language, in the above sense. Would we then have a satisfactory
semantic theory for the language?</p>

<p>
Some plausible arguments indicate that we would not. To adopt an
example from Quine (1970 [1986], pp. 8&ndash;9), let&rsquo;s assume
that the set of animals with hearts (which Quine, for convenience,
calls &ldquo;cordates&rdquo; &ndash; not to be confused with
&ldquo;chordates&rdquo;) is the same as the set of animals with
kidneys (which Quine calls &ldquo;renates&rdquo;). Now, consider the
pair of sentences:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em" id="ex5">

<li id="ex5-cordates"><span class="tag">(5)</span><span class="sen">
All cordates are cordates.</span></li>

<li id="ex6-cordates"><span class="tag">(6)</span><span class="sen">
All cordates are renates.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Given our assumption, both sentences are true. Moreover, from the
point of view of the theory of reference, (5) and (6) are just the
same: they differ only in the substitution of &ldquo;renates&rdquo;
for &ldquo;cordates&rdquo;, and these expressions have the same
reference (because they stand for the same function from objects to
truth-values).</p>

<p>
All the same, there is clearly an intuitive difference in meaning
between (5) and (6); the sentences seem, in some sense, to say
different things. The first seems to express the trivial, boring
thought that every creature with a heart is a creature with a heart,
whereas the second expresses the non-trivial, potentially informative
claim that every creature with a heart also has a kidney. This
suggests that there is an important difference between (5) and (6)
which our theory of reference fails to capture.</p>

<p>
Examples of the same sort can be generated using pairs of expressions
of other types which share a reference, but intuitively differ in
meaning; for example, &ldquo;Clark Kent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Superman&rdquo;, or (an example famously discussed by Frege
(1892a [1960]), &ldquo;the Morning Star&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Evening
Star&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
This might seem a rather weak argument for the incompleteness of the
theory of reference, resting as it does on intuitions about the
relative informativeness of sentences like (5) and (6). But this
argument can be strengthened by embedding sentences like (5) and (6)
in more complex sentences, as follows:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em" id="ex7">

<li id="ex7-cordates"><span class="tag">(7)</span><span class="sen">
John believes that all cordates are <u>cordates</u>.</span></li>

<li id="ex8-cordates"><span class="tag">(8)</span><span class="sen">
John believes that all cordates are <u>renates</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(7) and (8) differ only with respect to the underlined expressions
and, as we noted above, these expressions have the same reference.
Despite this, it seems clear that (7) and (8) could differ in
truth-value: someone could know that all cordates have a heart without
having any opinion on the question of whether all cordates have a
kidney. But that means that the references of expressions don&rsquo;t
even do the job for which they were introduced: they don&rsquo;t
explain the contribution that expressions make to the determination of
the truth-value of all sentences in which they occur. (One might still
think that the reference of an expression explains its contribution to
the determination of the truth-value of a suitably delimited class of
simple sentences in which the expression occurs.) If we are to be able
to explain, in terms of the properties of the expressions that make
them up, how (7) and (8) can differ in truth-value, then expressions
must have some other sort of value, some sort of meaning, which goes
beyond reference.</p>

<p>
(7) and (8) are called <em>belief ascriptions</em>, because they
ascribe a belief to a subject. Belief ascriptions are one sort of
<em>propositional attitude ascription</em>&mdash;other types include
ascriptions of knowledge, desire, or judgment. As will become clear in
what follows, propositional attitude ascriptions have been very
important in recent debates in semantics. One of the reasons why they
have been important is exemplified by (7) and (8). Because these
sentences can differ in truth-value despite the fact that they differ
only with respect to the underlined words, and these words both share
a reference and occupy the same place in the structure of the two
sentences, we say that (7) and (8) contain a <em>non-extensional
context</em>: roughly, a &ldquo;location&rdquo; in the sentence which
is such that substitution of terms which share a reference in that
location can change truth-value. (They&rsquo;re called
&ldquo;non-extensional contexts&rdquo; because &ldquo;extension&rdquo;
is another term for
 &ldquo;reference&rdquo;.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
We can give a similar argument for the incompleteness of the theory of
reference based on the substitution of whole sentences. A theory of
reference assigns to subsentential expressions values which explain
their contribution to the truth-values of sentences; but to those
sentences, it only assigns &ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;false&rdquo;.
But consider a pair of sentences like</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em" id="ex9">

<li id="ex9Mbbop"><span class="tag">(9)</span><span class="sen"> Mary
believes that <u>Barack Obama was the president of the United
States</u>.</span></li>

<li id="ex10Mbbop"><span class="tag">(10)</span><span class="sen">
Mary believes that <u>John Key was the prime minister of New
Zealand</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Because both of the underlined sentences are true, (9) and (10) are a
pair of sentences which differ only with respect to substitution of
expressions (namely, the underlined sentences) with the same
reference. Nonetheless, (9) and (10) could plainly differ in
truth-value.</p>

<p>
This seems to show that a semantic theory should assign some value to
sentences other than a truth-value. Another route to this conclusion
is the apparent truth of claims of the following sort:</p>

<ul>

<li>There are three things that John believes about Indiana, and they
are all false.</li>

<li>There are many necessary truths which are not <em>a priori</em>,
and my favorite sentence expresses one of them.</li>

<li>To get an A you must believe everything I say.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sentences like these suggest that there are things which are the
objects of mental states like belief, the bearers of truth and falsity
as well as modal properties like necessity and possibility and
epistemic properties like a prioricity and posterioricity, and the
things expressed by sentences. What are these things? The theory of
reference provides no answer.</p>

<p>
These entities are often called <em>propositions</em>. Friends of
propositions aim both to provide a theory of these entities, and, in
so doing, also to solve the two problems for the theory of reference
discussed above: (i) the lack of an explanation for the fact that
 <a href="#ex5-cordates">(5)</a>
 is trivial while
 <a href="#ex6-cordates">(6)</a>
 is not, and (ii) the fact (exemplified by
 <a href="#ex7">(7)/(8)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex9">(9)/(10)</a>)
 that sentences which differ only in the substitution of expressions
with the same reference can differ in truth-value.</p>

<p>
A theory of propositions thus does not abandon the theory of
reference, as sketched above, but simply says that there is more to a
semantic theory than the theory of reference. Subsentential
expressions have, in addition to a reference, a <em>content</em>. The
contents of sentences&mdash;what sentences express&mdash;are
propositions.</p>

<h4 id="RelaBetwContRefe">2.1.3 The relationship between content and reference</h4>

<p>
What is the relationship between content and reference? Let&rsquo;s
examine this question in connection with sentences; here it amounts to
the question of the relationship between the proposition a sentence
expresses and the sentence&rsquo;s truth-value. One point brought out
by the example of
 <a href="#ex9Mbbop">(9)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex10Mbbop">(10)</a>
 is that two sentences can express different propositions while having
the same truth-value. After all, the beliefs ascribed to Mary by these
sentences are different; so if propositions are the objects of belief,
the propositions corresponding to the underlined sentences must be
different. Nonetheless, both sentences are true.</p>

<p>
Is the reverse possible? Can two sentences express the same
proposition, but differ in truth-value? It seems not, as can be
illustrated again by the role of propositions as the objects of
belief. Suppose that you and I believe the exact same thing&mdash;both
of us believe the world to be just the same way. Can my belief be
true, and yours false? Intuitively, it seems not; it seems incoherent
to say that we both believe the world to be the same way, but that I
get things right and you get them wrong. (Though see the discussion of
relativism in
 <a href="#HowManyIndi">&sect;2.3.2</a>
 below for a dissenting view.) So it seems that if two sentences
express the same proposition, they must have the same truth value.</p>

<p>
In general, then, it seems plausible that two sentences with the same
content&mdash;i.e., which express the same proposition&mdash;must
always have the same reference, though two expressions with the same
reference can differ in content. This is the view stated by the
Fregean slogan that sense determines reference (&ldquo;sense&rdquo;
being the conventional translation of Frege&rsquo;s <em>Sinn</em>,
which was his word for what we are calling &ldquo;content&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
If this holds for sentences, does it also hold for subsentential
expressions? It seems that it must. Suppose for reductio that two
subsentential expressions, <em>e</em> and <em>e*</em>, have the same
content but differ in reference. It seems plausible that two sentences
which differ only by the substitution of expressions with the same
content must have the same
 content.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 But if this is true, then sentences which differ only in the
substitution of <em>e</em> and <em>e*</em> would have the same
content. But such a pair of sentences could differ in truth-value,
since, for any pair of expressions which differ in reference, there is
some pair of sentences which differ only by the substitution of those
expressions and differ in truth-value. So if there could be a pair of
expressions like <em>e</em> and <em>e*</em>, which differ in their
reference but not in their content, there could be a pair of sentences
which have the same content&mdash;which express the same
proposition&mdash;but differ in truth-value. But this is what we
argued above to be impossible; hence there could be no pair of
expressions like <em>e</em> and <em>e*</em>, and content must
determine reference for subsentential expressions as well as
sentences.</p>

<p>
This result&mdash;that content determines reference&mdash;explains one
thing we should, plausibly, want a semantic theory to do: it should
assign to each expression some value&mdash;a content&mdash;which
determines a reference for that expression.</p>

<h4 id="CharContContCirc">2.1.4 Character and content, context and circumstance</h4>

<p>
However, there is an obvious problem with the idea that we can assign
a content, in this sense, to all of the expressions of a language like
English: many expressions, like &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;here&rdquo;,
have a different reference when uttered by different speakers in
different situations. So we plainly cannot assign to &ldquo;I&rdquo; a
single content which determines a reference for the expression, since
the expression has a different reference in different situations.
These &ldquo;situations&rdquo; are typically called <em>contexts of
utterance</em>, or just <em>contexts</em>, and expressions whose
reference depends on the context are called
 <a href="../indexicals/">indexicals (see entry)</a>
 or <em>context-dependent expressions</em>.</p>

<p>
The existence of such expressions shows that a semantic theory must do
more than simply assign contents to every expression of the language.
Expressions like &ldquo;I&rdquo; must also be associated with rules
which determine the content of the expression, given a context of
utterance. These rules, which are (or determine) functions from
contexts to contents, are called <em>characters</em>. (The terminology
here, as well as the view of the relationship between context,
content, and reference, is due to Kaplan 1989a) So the character of
&ldquo;I&rdquo; must be some function from contexts to contents which,
in a context in which I am the speaker, delivers a content which
determines me as reference; in a context in which Barack Obama is the
speaker, delivers a content which determines Barack Obama as
reference; and so on. (See figure 1.)</p>

</div>

<p>
Here we face another potentially misleading ambiguity in
&ldquo;meaning&rdquo;. What is the real <em>meaning</em> of an
expression&mdash;its character, or its content (in the relevant
context)? The best answer here is a pluralist one. Expressions have
characters which, given a context, determine a content. We can talk
about either character or content, and both are important. The
important thing is to be clear on the distinction, and to see the
reasons for thinking that expressions have both a character and
(relative to a context) a content.</p>

<p>
How many indexical expressions are there? There are some obvious
candidates&mdash;&ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;here&rdquo;,
&ldquo;now&rdquo;, a few others&mdash;but beyond the obvious
candidates, it is very much a matter of dispute; for discussion, see
 <a href="#HowMuchContSens">&sect;2.3.1</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
One foundational challenge for theorizing about context-sensitive
expressions is to explain what the character of these expressions is.
In the case of &lsquo;I,&rsquo; &lsquo;here,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;now,&rsquo; this seems relatively straightforward; these
expressions seem (respectively) to pick out the speaker, time, and
place of the context of utterance. But matters get much more difficult
once we look beyond this basic set.</p>

<p>
Consider for example demonstrative expressions, like
&lsquo;this,&rsquo; &lsquo;that,&rsquo; or &lsquo;that book.&rsquo;
What determines the reference of these expressions in a context of
utterance?</p>

<p>
A natural first thought is that, since these expressions are often
accompanied by pointing gestures, the reference of uses of these
expressions are fixed by these gestures. But this seems insufficiently
general, since many uses of these expressions are not accompanied by
gestures; and even if this were not true, it is hard to see how a
gesture alone could determine a referent. When one points to one
thing, one always also points to many (the person, the person&rsquo;s
shirt, the second button on the person&rsquo;s shirt ...).</p>

<p>
A natural second thought is to appeal to the intentions of the
speaker. Given that speakers typically have intentions in uttering
expressions, intention-based theory also promises to have a generality
that the gesture-based theory does not. But complications quickly
arise. Marga Reimer (1991, p. 90) gives this example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose, for instance, that I suddenly realize that I have left my
keys on the desk my (shared) office. I return to my office, where I
find the desk occupied by my officemate. I then spot my keys, sitting
there on the desk, alongside my officemate&rsquo;s keys. I then make a
grab for my keys, saying just as I mistakenly grab my
officemate&rsquo;s keys, &lsquo;These are mine&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the speaker intends to refer to her keys, but these are not the
value of her use of the demonstrative &lsquo;these.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
One response to this kind of case is to develop a more sophisticated
intention-based treatment of context sensitive expressions; for a
prominent example of this approach, see King (2014b). A different
approach appeals, not to the intentions of language users, but to
facts about what is salient to the conversational participants. For a
theory of this kind, see Mount (2008). A third approach appeals to a
richer understanding of the context of utterance. On this view,
discourse conventions determine coherence relations between parts of
the discourse which play a key role in fixing the values of
context-sensitive expressions. This view is laid out and defended in
Stojnic&#769; (2021).</p>

<p>
There is a line of thought that might at first suggest that every
expression is an indexical. Consider an expression which does not seem
to be context-sensitive, like &ldquo;the winner of the 2020 United
States presidential election&rdquo;. This does not seem to be
context-sensitive, because it seems to refer to the same
individual&mdash;Joe Biden&mdash;whether uttered by me, you, or some
other English speaker. But now consider a sentence like</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex11"><span class="tag">(11)</span><span class="sen"> If
Donald Trump had won a few more states, Trump would have been the
winner of the 2020 United States presidential election.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
This sentence is true. But for it to be true, &ldquo;the winner of the
2020 United States presidential election&rdquo; would have to, in
(11), refer to Donald Trump. But then it seems like this expression
must be an indexical&mdash;its reference must depend on the context of
utterance. In (11), the thought goes, the phrase &ldquo;<span class="sen">If
Donald Trump had won a few more states</span>&rdquo;
shifts the context: in (11), &ldquo;the winner of the 2020 United
States presidential election&rdquo; refers to the individual that it
would have referred to if uttered in a situation in which <span class="sen">Donald
Trump had won a few more states</span>.</p>

<p>
However, this can&rsquo;t be quite right, as is shown by examples like
this one:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex12"><span class="tag">(12)</span><span class="sen"> If my
parents had never met, I would not exist.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s suppose that this sentence, as uttered by me, is true.
Then, if what we said about
 <a href="#ex11">(11)</a>
 was right, it seems that &ldquo;I&rdquo; must, in, (12), refer to
whoever it would refer to if it were uttered in a situation in which
my parents never met. So the one thing we know is that (assuming that
(12) is true), it does not refer to me&mdash;after all, I would not
have been around to utter anything. But, plainly, the &ldquo;I&rdquo;
in (12) <em>does</em> refer to me when this sentence is uttered by
me&mdash;after all, it is a claim about me. What&rsquo;s going on
here?</p>

<p>
What examples like (12) are often taken to show is that the reference
of an expression must be relativized, not just to a context of
utterance, but also to a <em>circumstance of evaluation</em>&mdash;at
a first pass, the possible state of the world relevant to the
determination of the truth or falsity of the sentence. In the case of
many simple sentences, context and circumstance coincide; details
aside, they both just are the state of the world at the time of the
utterance, with a designated speaker and place. But sentences like
(12) show that they can come apart. Phrases like &ldquo;<span class="sen">If
my parents had never met</span>&rdquo; shift the
circumstance of evaluation&mdash;they change the state of the world
relevant to the evaluation of the truth or falsity of the
sentence&mdash;but don&rsquo;t change the context of utterance.
That&rsquo;s why when I utter (12), &ldquo;I&rdquo; refers to
me&mdash;despite the fact that I would not have existed to utter it in
if my parents had never met.</p>

<div class="figure" id="ffig2">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2.</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#ffig2">extended description of figure 2</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The kind of theory which results is sometimes called a
<em>double-indexing semantics</em>&mdash;the two indices being
contexts of utterance and circumstances of evaluation. (See figure
2.)</p>

<p>
The classic explanation of a double-indexing semantics is Kaplan
(1989a); another important early discussion is Kamp (1971). For a
different interpretation of the framework, see David Lewis (1980). For
a classic discussion of some of the philosophical issues raised by
indexicals, see Perry (1979).</p>

<p>
Double-indexing explains how we can regard the reference of &ldquo;the
winner of the 2020 United States presidential election&rdquo; in
 <a href="#ex11">(11)</a>
 to be Donald Trump, without taking &ldquo;the winner of the 2020
United States presidential election&rdquo; to be an indexical like
&ldquo;I&rdquo;. On this view, &ldquo;the winner of the 2020 United
States presidential election&rdquo; does not vary in content depending
on the context of utterance; rather, the content of this phrase is
such that it determines a different reference with respect to
different circumstances of evaluation. In particular, it has Joe
Bidens as its reference with respect to the present state of the
actual world, and has Donald Trump as its reference with respect to
the state of the world decribed in (11). Because &ldquo;the winner of
the 2020 United States presidential election&rdquo; refers to
different things with respect to different circumstances, it is not a
 <a href="../rigid-designators/">rigid designator (see entry)</a>&mdash;these
 being expressions which (relative to a context of utterance) refer to
the same object with respect to every circumstance of evaluation at
which that object exists, and never refer to anything else with
respect to another circumstance of evaluation. (The term &ldquo;rigid
designator&rdquo; is due to Kripke [1972].) For a discussion of
different views about the nature of circumstances of evaluation and
their motivations, see
 <a href="#HowManyIndi">&sect;2.3.2</a>
 below.</p>

<h4 id="PossWorlSema">2.1.5 Possible worlds semantics</h4>

<p>
So we know that expressions are associated with characters, which are
functions from contexts to contents; and we know that contents are
things which, for each circumstance of evaluation, determine a
reference. We can now raise a central question of (classical) semantic
theories: what sorts of things are contents? The foregoing suggests a
pleasingly minimalist answer to this question: perhaps, since contents
are things which together with circumstances of evaluation determine a
reference, contents just <em>are</em> functions from circumstances of
evaluation to a reference.</p>

<p>
This view sounds abstract but is, in a way, quite intuitive. The idea
is that the content of an expression is not what the expression stands
for in the relevant circumstance, but rather a rule which tells you
what the expression would stand for if the world were a certain way.
So, on this view, the content of an expression like &ldquo;the tallest
man in the world&rdquo; is not simply the man who happens to be
tallest, but rather a function from ways the world might be to
men&mdash;namely, that function which, for any way the world might be,
returns as a referent the tallest man in that world (if there is one,
and nothing otherwise). This fits nicely with the intuitive idea that
to understand such an expression one needn&rsquo;t know what the
expression actually refers to&mdash;after all, one can understand
&ldquo;the tallest man&rdquo; without knowing who the tallest man
is&mdash;but must know how to tell what the expression would refer to,
given certain information about the world (namely, the heights of all
the men in it).</p>

<p>
These functions, or rules, are called (following Carnap (1947))
<em>intensions</em>. Possible worlds semantics is the view that
contents are intensions (and hence that characters are functions from
contexts to intensions, i.e. functions from contexts to functions from
circumstances of evaluation to a reference). (See figure 3.)</p>

<div class="figure" id="ffig3">
<img alt="diagram with text: link to extended description below" src="pws.gif" style="width:600px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3.</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#ffig3">extended description of figure 3</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The intension of a sentence&mdash;i.e., the proposition that sentence
expresses, on the present view&mdash;will then be a function from
worlds to truth-values. In particular, it will be that function which
returns the truth-value true for every world with respect to which
that sentence is true, and false otherwise. The intension of a simple
predicate like &ldquo;is red&rdquo; will be a function from worlds to
the function from objects to truth-values which, for each world,
returns the truth-value true if the thing in question is red, and
returns the truth-value false otherwise. In effect, possible worlds
semantics takes the meanings of expressions to be functions from
worlds to the values which would be assigned by a theory of reference
to those expressions at the relevant world: in that sense, intensions
are a kind of &ldquo;extra layer&rdquo; on top of the theory of
reference. A classic discussion of the application of the framework of
possible world semantics to natural language is Lewis (1970); see also
von Fintel &amp; Heim (2020 [Other Internet Resources]).</p>

<p>
This extra layer promises to solve the problem posed by
non-extensional contexts, as illustrated by the example of
&ldquo;cordate&rdquo; and &ldquo;renate&rdquo; in
 <a href="#ex7">(7) and (8)</a>.
 Our worry was that, since these expressions have the same reference,
if meaning just is reference, then it seems that any pair of sentences
which differ only in the substitution of these expressions must have
the same truth-value. But (7) and (8) are such a pair of sentences,
and needn&rsquo;t have the same truth-value. The proponent of possible
worlds semantics solves this problem by identifying the meaning of
these expressions with their intension rather than their reference,
and by pointing out that &ldquo;cordate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;renate&rdquo;, while they share a reference, seem to have
different intensions. After all, even if in our world every creature
with a heart is a creature with a kidney (and vice versa), it seems
that the world could have been such that some creatures had a heart
but not a kidney. Since with respect to that circumstance of
evaluation the terms will differ in reference, their
intensions&mdash;which are just functions from circumstances of
evaluations to referents&mdash;must also differ. Hence possible worlds
semantics leaves room for (7) and (8) to differ in truth value, as
they manifestly can.</p>

<p>
The central problem facing possible worlds semantics, however,
concerns sentences of the same form as
 <a href="#ex7">(7) and (8)</a>:
 sentences which ascribe propositional attitudes, like beliefs, to
subjects. To see this problem, we can begin by asking: according to
possible worlds semantics, what does it take for a pair of sentences
to have the same content (i.e., express the same proposition)? Since
contents are intensions, and intensions are functions from
circumstances of evaluation to referents, it seems that two sentences
have the same content, according to possible worlds semantics, if they
have the same truth-value with respect to every circumstance of
evaluation. In other words, two sentences express the same proposition
if and only if it is impossible for them to differ in truth-value.</p>

<p>
The problem is that there are sentences which have the same
truth-value in every circumstance of evaluation, but seem to differ in
meaning. Consider, for example</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em" id="ex13">

<li id="ex13a"><span class="tag">(13)</span><span class="sen">
\(2+2=4\).</span></li>

<li id="ex13b"><span class="tag">(14)</span><span class="sen"> There
are infinitely many prime numbers.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
A standard view is that truths of mathematics like (13) and (14) are
necessary truths. If that is correct, then (13) and (14) have the same
intension and, according to possible worlds semantics, must have the
same content.</p>

<p>
But this is highly counterintuitive. (13) and (14) certainly seem to
say different things. The problem (just as with
 <a href="#ex5">(5) and (6)</a>)
 can be sharpened by embedding these sentences in propositional
attitude ascriptions:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em" id="ex15">

<li><span class="tag">(15)</span><span class="sen"> John believes that
<u>2 + 2 = 4</u>.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(16)</span><span class="sen"> John believes that
<u>there are infinitely many prime numbers</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
As we have just seen, the proponent of possible worlds semantics must
take the underlined sentences, (13) and (14), to have the same
content; hence, it seems, the proponent of possible worlds semantics
must take (15) and (16) to be a pair of sentences which differ only in
the substitution of expressions with the same content. But then it
seems that the proponent of possible worlds semantics must take this
pair of sentences to express the same proposition, and have the same
truth-value; but (15) and (16) (like
 <a href="#ex7">(7) and (8)</a>)
 seem to differ in truth-value, and hence seem not to express the same
proposition. For an influential extension of this argument, see Soames
(1988).</p>

<p>
For attempts to reply to the argument from within the framework of
possible worlds semantics, see among other places Stalnaker (1984) and
Yalcin (2018); for discussion of a related approach to semantics which
aims to avoid these problems, see
 <a href="../situations-semantics/">situations in natural language semantics (see entry)</a>.
 Another option is to invoke impossible as well as possible worlds;
one might then treat propositions as sets of worlds, which may or may
not be possible. If there is an impossible world in which there are
only finitely many primes but in which 2+2=4, that would promise to
give us the resources to distinguish between the set of worlds in
which
 <a href="#ex13a">(13)</a>
 is true and the set of worlds in which
 <a href="#ex13b">(14)</a>
 is true, and hence to explain the difference in truth-value between
 <a href="#ex15">(15) and (16)</a>.
 For an overview of issues involving impossible worlds, see Nolan
(2013); for an application of the framework of impossible worlds to
solve issues in the theory of content, see Berto &amp; Jago
(2019).</p>

<h4 id="RussSema">2.1.6 Russellian semantics</h4>

<p>
Suppose that we want an approach to semantics which makes room for
sentences like
 <a href="#ex13">(13) and (14)</a>,
 and hence also
 <a href="#ex15">(15) and (16)</a>,
 to express different propositions. That requires a view of meaning
which makes room for the possibility that a pair of sentences can be
true in just the same circumstances but nonetheless have genuinely
different contents.</p>

<p>
A natural thought is that
 <a href="#ex13">(13) and (14)</a>
 have different contents because they are about different things; for
example,
 <a href="#ex13b">(14)</a>
 makes a general claim about the set of prime numbers whereas
 <a href="#ex13a">(13)</a>
 is about the relationship between the numbers 2 and 4. One might want
our semantic theory to be sensitive to such differences: to count two
sentences as expressing different propositions if they are have
different subject matters, in this sense. One way to secure this
result is to think of the contents of subsentential expressions as
components of the proposition expressed by the sentence as a whole.
Differences in the contents of subsentential expressions would then be
sufficient for differences in the content of the sentence as a whole;
so, for example, since (14) but not (13) contains an expression which
refers to prime numbers, these sentences will express different
propositions.</p>

<p>
Proponents of this sort of view think of propositions as
<em>structured</em>: as having constituents which include the meanings
of the expressions which make up the sentence expressing the relevant
proposition. (See, for more discussion, the entry on
 <a href="../propositions-structured/">structured propositions</a>.)
 One important question for views of this sort is: what does it mean
for an abstract object, like a proposition, to be structured, and have
constituents? But this question would take us too far afield into
metaphysics (see
 <a href="#WhatProp">&sect;2.3.3</a>
 below for a brief discussion). The fundamental <em>semantic</em>
question for proponents of this sort of structured proposition view
is: what sorts of things are the constituents of propositions?</p>

<p>
The answer to this question given by a proponent of <em>Russellian
semantics</em> is: objects, properties, relations, and functions. (The
view is called &ldquo;Russellianism&rdquo; because of its resemblance
to the view of content defended in Chapter IV of Russell 1903.) So
described, Russellianism is a general view about what sorts of things
the constituents of propositions are, and does not carry a commitment
to any views about the contents of particular types of expressions.
However, most Russellians also endorse a particular view about the
contents of proper names which is known as <em>Millianism</em>: the
view that the meaning of a simple proper name is the object (if any)
for which it stands.</p>

<p>
Russellianism has much to be said for it. It not only solves the
problems with possible worlds semantics discussed above, but fits well
with the intuitive idea that the function of names is to single out
objects, and the function of predicates is to predicate properties of
those objects.</p>

<p>
However, Millian-Russellian semantic theories also face some problems.
One important problem for Russellian conceptions of propositions is a
paradox which is sometimes called &ldquo;Russell&rsquo;s paradox of
propositions&rdquo; and sometimes called the &ldquo;Russell-Myhill paradox.&rdquo; It
was first laid out in an appendix of Russell (1903), and can be laid
out informally as follows.</p>

<p>
Because Russellians individuate propositions by what objects,
properties, and relations they are about, it seems plausible that the
Russellian should think that for any distinct objects <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em>, the proposition that <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> is distinct
from the proposition that <em>b</em> is <em>F</em>. Now consider those
propositions which say of some set of propositions that every member
of that set is true; call these &ldquo;set-describing propositions.&rdquo; Given
the above assumptions, there will be, for every set-describing
proposition, exactly one set that it describes. Among the
set-describing propositions, there will be some which are members of
the set they describe, and some which are not. Let <em>w</em> be the
set of all set-describing propositions which are not members of the
set they describe. Now let <em>p</em> be the proposition that every
member of <em>w</em> is true.</p>

<p>
Is <em>p</em> an element of <em>w</em>? Suppose first that it is. Then
<em>p</em> is a set-describing proposition which is an element of the
set that it describes; so it is not an element of <em>w</em>. But that
contradicts our supposition. So suppose that it is not. Then
<em>p</em> is a set-describing proposition which is not an element of
the set that it describes; so it is an element of <em>w</em>. But that
again contradicts our supposition. So, whichever way we go, we get a
contradiction.</p>

<p>
This paradox targets, not Russellianism directly, but the
Russellian&rsquo;s assumptions about how fine-grained propositions
are. Arguably, then, it is also a problem for views (like the view
discussed in the next section) which make propositions more
fine-grained than the Russellian does. For a more rigorous discussion
and defense of the view that this paradox is a serious problem for
Russellian (and other structured) views, see Uzquiano (2015). For an
attempt to respond to the paradox within a Russellian framework, see
Kment (2022). For a general discussion of the morals of the paradox,
see Dorr &amp; Hawthorne
 (2021).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This is a broadly metaphysical problem for fine-grained views of
propositions. Millian-Russellian semantics also faces more
specifically semantic objections, of which two are especially
important.</p>

<p>
The first of these problems involves the existence of <em>empty
names</em>: names which have no referent. It is a commonplace that
there are such names; an example is &ldquo;Vulcan&rdquo;, the name
introduced for the planet between Mercury and the sun which was
causing perturbations in the orbit of Mercury. Because the
Millian-Russellian says that the content of a name is its referent,
the Millian-Russellian seems forced into saying that empty names lack
a content. But this is surprising; it seems that we can use empty
names in sentences to express propositions and form beliefs about the
world. The Millian-Russellian owes some explanation of how this is
possible, if such names genuinely lack a content. For a discussion of
this problem from a Millian point of view, see Braun (1993).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most important problem facing Millian-Russellian views,
though, is Frege&rsquo;s puzzle. Consider the sentences</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex21"><span class="tag">(17)</span><span class="sen"> Clark
Kent is Clark Kent.</span></li>

<li id="ex22"><span class="tag">(18)</span><span class="sen"> Clark
Kent is Superman.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
According to the Millian-Russellian, (17) and (18) differ only in the
substitution of expressions with have the same content: after all,
&ldquo;Clark Kent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Superman&rdquo; are proper names
which refer to the same object, and the Millian-Russellian holds that
the content of a proper name is the object to which that name refers.
But this is a surprising result. These sentences seem to differ in
meaning, because (17) seems to express a trivial, obvious claim,
whereas (18) seems to express a non-trivial, potentially informative
claim.</p>

<p>
This sort of objection to Millian-Russellian views can (as above) be
strengthened by embedding the intuitively different sentences in
propositional attitude ascriptions, as follows:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex23"><span class="tag">(19)</span><span class="sen"> Lois
believes that Clark Kent is <u>Clark Kent</u>.</span></li>

<li id="ex24"><span class="tag">(20)</span><span class="sen"> Lois
believes that Clark Kent is <u>Superman</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The problem posed by (19) and (20) for Russellian semantics is
analogous to the problem posed by
 <a href="#ex15">(15) and (16)</a>
 for possible worlds semantics. Here, as there, we have a pair of
belief ascriptions which seem as though they could differ in
truth-value despite the fact that these sentences differ only with
respect to expressions counted as synonymous by the relevant semantic
theory.</p>

<p>
Russellians have offered a variety of responses to Frege&rsquo;s
puzzle. Many Russellians think that our intuition that sentences like
 <a href="#ex23">(19)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex24">(20)</a>
 can differ in truth-value is based on a mistake. This mistake might
be explained at least partly in terms of a confusion between the
proposition semantically expressed by a sentence in a context and the
propositions speakers would typically use that sentence to
pragmatically convey (Salm&oacute;n 1986; Soames 2002), or in terms of
the fact that a single proposition may be believed under several
&ldquo;propositional guises&rdquo; (again, see Salm&oacute;n 1986), or
in terms of a failure to integrate pieces of information stored using
distinct mental representations (Braun &amp; Saul
 2002).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Alternatively, a Russellian might try to make room for (19) and (20)
to genuinely differ in truth-value by giving up the idea that
sentences which differ only in the substitution of proper names with
the same content must express the same proposition (Taschek 1995, Fine
2007).</p>

<h4 id="FregSema">2.1.7 Fregean semantics</h4>

<p>
However, these are not the only responses to Frege&rsquo;s puzzle.
Just as the Russellian responded to the problem posed by
 <a href="#ex15">(15) and (16)</a>
 by holding that two sentences with the same intension can differ in
meaning, one might respond to the problem posed by
 <a href="#ex23">(19)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex24">(20)</a>
 by holding that two names which refer to the same object can differ
in meaning, thus making room for (19) and (20) to differ in
truth-value. This is to endorse a Fregean response to Frege&rsquo;s
puzzle, and to abandon the Russellian approach to semantics (or, at
least, to abandon Millian-Russellian semantics).</p>

<p>
Fregeans, like Russellians, often think of the proposition expressed
by a sentence as a structured entity with constituents which are the
contents of the expressions making up the sentence. But Fregeans,
unlike Russellians, do not think of these propositional constituents
as the objects, properties, and relations for which these expressions
stand; instead, Fregeans think of the contents as modes of
presentation, or ways of thinking about, objects, properties, and
relations. The standard term for these modes of presentation is
<em>sense</em>. (As with &ldquo;intension&rdquo;, &ldquo;sense&rdquo;
is sometimes also used as a synonym for &ldquo;content&rdquo;. But, as
with &ldquo;intension&rdquo;, it avoids confusion to restrict
&ldquo;sense&rdquo; for &ldquo;content, as construed by Fregean
semantics&rdquo;. It is then controversial whether there are such
things as senses, and whether they are the contents of expressions.)
Frege explained his view of senses with an analogy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The reference of a proper name is the object itself which we designate
by its means; the idea, which we have in that case, is wholly
subjective; in between lies the sense, which is indeed no longer
subjective like the idea, but is yet not the object itself. The
following analogy will perhaps clarify these relationships. Somebody
observes the Moon through a telescope. I compare the Moon itself to
the reference; it is the object of the observation, mediated by the
real image projected by the object glass in the interior of the
telescope, and by the retinal image of the observer. The former I
compare to the sense, the latter is like the idea or experience. The
optical image in the telescope is indeed one-sided and dependent upon
the standpoint of observation; but it is still objective, inasmuch as
it can be used by several observers. At any rate it could be arranged
for several to use it simultaneously. But each one would have his own
retinal image. (Frege 1892a [1960])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Senses are then objective, in that more than one person can express
thoughts with a given sense. They also correspond many-one to objects.
Thus, just as Russellian propositions correspond many-one to
intensions, Fregean propositions correspond many-one to Russellian
propositions. This is sometimes expressed by the claim that Fregean
contents are more <em>fine-grained</em> than Russellian contents (or
intensions).</p>

<p>
Indeed, we can think of our three classical semantic theories, along
with the theory of reference, as related by this kind of many-one
relation, as illustrated by the chart below:</p>

<div class="figure" id="ffig4">
<img alt="diagram: link to extended description below" src="levels.jpg" style="width:600px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4.</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#ffig4">extended description of figure 4</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The principal argument for Fregean semantics (which also motivated
Frege himself) is the neat solution the view offers to Frege&rsquo;s
puzzle: the view says that, in cases like
 <a href="#ex23">(19)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex24">(20)</a>
 in which there seems to be a difference in content, there really is a
difference in content: the names share a reference, but differ in
their sense, because they differ in their mode of presentation of
their shared reference.</p>

<p>
A first challenge for Fregeanism is the challenge of giving a
non-metaphorical explanation of the nature of sense. This is a problem
for the Fregean in a way that it is not for the possible worlds
semanticist or the Russellian since the Fregean, unlike these two,
introduces a new class of entities to serve as meanings of expressions
rather than merely appropriating an already recognized sort of
entity&mdash;like a function, or an object, property, or
relation&mdash;to serve this
 purpose.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A first step toward answering this challenge is provided by a
criterion for telling when two expressions differ in meaning, which
might be stated as follows. In his 1906 paper, &ldquo;A Brief Survey
of My Logical Doctrines&rdquo;, Frege seems to endorse the following
criterion:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Frege&rsquo;s criterion of difference for senses</em>
<br />
Two sentences <em>S</em> and <em>S*</em> differ in sense if and only
if some rational agent who understood both could, on reflection, judge
that <em>S</em> is true without judging that <em>S*</em> is true.
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider (17) and (18), which we saw make trouble for
Millian-Russellian views of content. Someone could clearly understand
both and, on reflection, judge that (17) is true and (18) false. (Lois
Lane is such a person.) Frege&rsquo;s criterion would then imply that
the sentences have different senses, which is what we
 want.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
But even if this tells us when names differ in sense, it does not
quite tell us what the sense of a name <em>is</em>. Here is one
initially plausible way of explaining what the sense of a name is. We
know that, whatever the content of a name is, it must be something
which determines as a reference the object for which the name stands;
and we know that, if Fregeanism is true, this must be something other
than the object itself. A natural thought, then, is that the content
of a name&mdash;its sense&mdash;is some condition which the referent
of the name uniquely satisfies. Coreferential names can differ in
sense because there is always more than one condition which a given
object uniquely satisfies. (For example, Superman/Clark Kent uniquely
satisfies both the condition of being the superhero Lois most admires,
and the newspaperman she least admires.) Given this view, it is
natural to then hold that names have the same meanings as <em>definite
descriptions</em>&mdash;phrases of the form &ldquo;the
so-and-so&rdquo;. After all, phrases of this sort seem to be designed
to pick out the unique object, if any, which satisfies the condition
following the &ldquo;the&rdquo;. (For more discussion, see entry on
 <a href="../descriptions/">descriptions</a>.)
 This Fregean view of names is called <em>Fregean
descriptivism</em>.</p>

<p>
However, as Saul Kripke argued in <em>Naming and Necessity</em>,
Fregean descriptivism faces some serious problems. Here is one of the
arguments he gave against the view, which is called the <em>modal
argument</em>. Consider a name like &ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo;, and
suppose for purposes of exposition that the sense I associate with
that name is the sense of the definite description &ldquo;the greatest
philosopher of antiquity&rdquo;. Now consider the following pair of
sentences:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex25"><span class="tag">(21)</span><span class="sen">
Necessarily, if Aristotle exists, then Aristotle is
<u>Aristotle</u>.</span></li>

<li id="ex26"><span class="tag">(22)</span><span class="sen">
Necessarily, if Aristotle exists, then Aristotle is <u>the greatest
philosopher of antiquity</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
If Fregean descriptivism is true, and &ldquo;the greatest philosopher
of antiquity&rdquo; is indeed the description I associate with the
name &ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo;, then it seems that (21) and (22) must be
a pair of sentences which differ only via the substitution of
expressions (the underlined ones) with the same content. If this is
right, then (21) and (22) must express the same proposition, and have
the same truth-value. But this seems to be a mistake; while (21)
appears to be true (Aristotle could hardly have failed to be himself),
(22) appears to be false (perhaps Aristotle could have been a
shoemaker rather than a philosopher; or perhaps if Plato had worked a
bit harder, he rather than Aristotle could have been the greatest
philosopher of antiquity).</p>

<p>
An important precursor to Kripke&rsquo;s arguments against Fregean
descriptivism is Marcus (1961), which argues that names are
&ldquo;tags&rdquo; for objects rather than abbreviated descriptions.
Fregean descriptivists have given various replies to Kripke&rsquo;s
modal and other arguments; see especially Plantinga (1978), Dummett
(1981), and Sosa (2001). For rejoinders to these Fregean replies, see
Soames (1998, 2002) and Caplan (2005). For a defense of a view of
descriptions which promises a reply to the modal argument, see
Rothschild (2007). For a discussion of Kripke&rsquo;s other arguments
against Fregean descriptivism, see &sect;2.4 of the entry on
 <a href="../names/#2.4">names</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Kripke&rsquo;s arguments provide a strong reason for Fregeans to deny
Fregean descriptivism, and hold instead that the senses of proper
names are not the senses of any definite description associated with
those names by speakers. The main problem for this sort of
<em>non-descriptive Fregeanism</em> is to explain what the sense of a
name might be such that it can determine the reference of the name, if
it is not a condition uniquely satisfied by the reference of the name.
Non-descriptive Fregean views were defended in McDowell (1977) and
Evans (1981). Perhaps the most influential recent version of the view
is a kind of blend of Fregean semantics and possible worlds semantics.
This is the epistemic two-dimensionalist approach to semantics which
has been developed by David Chalmers. See Chalmers (2004,2006).</p>

<p>
Suppose that the Fregean has provided an account of senses which is
suitable to solve Frege&rsquo;s puzzle. A second argument against
Fregean approaches to semantics suggests that any view of meaning
which is fine-grained enough to provide a general solution to
Frege&rsquo;s puzzle will be both implausible and will give rise to
problems of explaining substitution success.</p>

<p>
The argument can be pressed using a kind of example first introduced
by Kripke (1979). These are examples of pairs of expressions which
seem to be synonymous but, despite this fact, give rise to instances
of Frege&rsquo;s puzzle.</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, &ldquo;catsup&rdquo; and &ldquo;ketchup&rdquo;.
(The example is from Salm&oacute;n 1990.) Now consider Bob, a confused
condiment user, who thinks that the tasty red substance standardly
labeled &ldquo;catsup&rdquo; at his favorite breakfast restaurant is
distinct from the tasty red substance standardly labeled
&ldquo;ketchup&rdquo; served at his favorite lunch restaurant, and
consider the following pair of sentences:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex27"><span class="tag">(23)</span><span class="sen"> Bob
believes that catsup is <u>catsup</u>.</span></li>

<li id="ex28"><span class="tag">(24)</span><span class="sen"> Bob
believes that catsup is <u>ketchup</u>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(23) and (24) seem quite a bit like (19) and (20): these each seem to
be pairs of sentences which differ in truth-value, despite differing
only in the substitution of the underlined expressions. So there is
some pressure on the Fregean to explain the apparent difference in
truth-value between (23) and (24) in just the way they explain the
apparent difference in truth-value between (19) and (20): by positing
a difference in meaning between &lsquo;catsup&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ketchup.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
But this can look implausible; surely if any expressions in English
are synonymous, these are. Further, as Kripke (1979) points out,
similar problems arise from distinct tokens of a single name. So the
Fregean seems forced to say that there are differences in meaning, not
just between apparent synonyms like &lsquo;catsup&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ketchup,&rsquo; but also between distinct tokens of one name.
There turn out to be many more differences in meaning than one might
have thought.</p>

<p>
Many Fregeans embrace this very fine-grained view of meanings.
However, some object that, while this would provide the resources for
a general explanation of substitution failures, it gives rise to
difficult problems in explaining substitution success. We often
ascribe beliefs and other propositional attitudes to subjects without
having any expectation that we think of the objects the attitude is
about in the same way. For example, it seems plausible that I can
truly say &lsquo;Plato believed that Socrates was wise.&rsquo; Of
course I have no expectation that the sense I attach to
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; is at all close to the sense Plato attached to
any of his devices for referring to Socrates. But that suggests that,
if Fregeanism is true, the above ascription attributes a belief to
Plato which Plato simply did not have and is therefore false. Most
agree that this would be an implausible result. A standard line of
response is to say that the truth of an attitude ascription requires,
not identity of sense between the that-clause as uttered by the
ascriber and the attitude of the subject of the ascription, but just
that these two senses stand in some (presumably context-sensitive)
relation. See for discussion and defense Chalmers
 (2011).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="AlteClasSemaTheo">2.2 Alternatives to Classical Semantic Theories</h3>

<p>
Classical semantic theories are not the only game in town. This
section lays out the basics of five alternatives to classical semantic
theorizing.</p>

<h4 id="DaviSema">2.2.1 Davidsonian semantics</h4>

<p>
One kind of challenge to classical semantics attacks the idea that the
job of a semantic theory is to systematically pair expressions with
the entities which are their meanings. Wittgenstein was parodying just
this idea when he wrote</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You say: the point isn&rsquo;t the word, but its meaning, and you
think of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though
also different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The
money, and the cow that you can buy with it. (Wittgenstein 1953,
&sect;120)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While Wittgenstein himself did not think that systematic theorizing
about semantics was possible, this anti-theoretical stance has not
been shared by all subsequent philosophers who share his aversion to
&ldquo;meanings as entities&rdquo;. A case in point is Donald
Davidson. Davidson thought that semantic theory should take the form
of a theory of truth for the language of the sort which Alfred Tarski
showed us how to construct (see Tarski 1944 and the entry on
 <a href="../tarski-truth/">Tarski&rsquo;s truth definitions</a>).</p>
 
<p>
For our purposes, it will be convenient to think of a Tarskian truth
theory as a variant on the sorts of theories of reference introduced
in
 <a href="#TheoRefe">&sect;2.1.1</a>.
 Recall that theories of reference of this sort specified, for each
proper name in the language, the object to which that name refers, and
for every simple predicate in the language, the set of things which
satisfy that predicate. If we then consider a sentence which combines
a proper name with such a predicate, like</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Amelia sings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
the theory tells us what it would take for that sentence to be true:
it tells us that this sentence is true if and only if the object to
which &ldquo;Amelia&rdquo; refers is a member of the set of things
which satisfy the predicate &ldquo;sings&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., if and
only if Amelia sings. So we can think of a full theory of reference
for the language as implying, for each sentence of this sort, a
<em>T-sentence</em> of the form</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Amelia sings&rdquo; is <em>T</em> (in the language) if and only
if Amelia sings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose now that we expand our theory of reference so that it implies
a T-sentence of this sort for every sentence of the language, rather
than just for simple sentences which result from combining a name and
a monadic predicate. We would then have a Tarskian truth theory for
our language. Tarski&rsquo;s idea was that such a theory would define
a truth predicate (&ldquo;<em>T</em>&rdquo;) for the language;
Davidson, by contrast, thought that we find in Tarskian truth theories
&ldquo;the sophisticated and powerful foundation of a competent theory
of meaning&rdquo; (Davidson 1967).</p>

<p>
This claim can seem puzzling: why should a a theory which issues
T-sentences, but makes no explicit claims about meaning or content,
count as a <em>semantic</em> theory? Davidson&rsquo;s answer was that
knowledge of such a theory would be sufficient to understand the
language. If Davidson were right about this, then he would have a
plausible argument that a semantic theory could take this form. After
all, it is plausible that someone who understands a language knows the
meanings of the expressions in the language; so, if knowledge of a
Tarskian truth theory for the language were sufficient to understand
the language, then knowledge of what that theory says would be
sufficient to know all the facts about the meanings of expressions in
the language, in which case it seems that the theory would state all
the facts about the meanings of expressions in the language.</p>

<p>
One advantage of this sort of approach to semantics is its parsimony:
it makes no use of the intensions, Russellian propositions, or Fregean
senses assigned to expressions by the propositional semantic theories
discussed above. Of course, as we saw above, these entities were
introduced to provide a satisfactory semantic treatment of various
sorts of linguistic constructions, and one might well wonder whether
it is possible to provide a Tarskian truth theory of the sort sketched
above for a natural language without making use of intensions,
Russellian propositions, or Fregean senses. The Davidsonian program
obviously requires that we be able to do this, but it is still very
much a matter of controversy whether a truth theory of this sort can
be constructed. Discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this
entry; one good way into this debate is through the debate about
whether the Davidsonian program can provide an adequate treatment of
propositional attitude ascriptions. See the discussion of the
paratactic account and interpreted logical forms in the entry on
 <a href="../prop-attitude-reports/">propositional attitude reports</a>.
 (For Davidson&rsquo;s initial treatment of attitude ascriptions, see
Davidson 1968; for further discussion see, among other places, Burge
1986; Schiffer 1987; Lepore and Loewer 1989; Larson and Ludlow 1993;
Soames 2002.)</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s set this aside, and assume that a Tarskian truth theory of
the relevant sort can be constructed, and ask whether, given this
supposition, this sort of theory would provide an adequate semantics.
There are two fundamental reasons for thinking that it would not, both
of which are ultimately due to Foster (1976). Larson and Segal (1995)
call these the <em>extension problem</em> and the <em>information
problem</em>.</p>

<p>
The extension problem stems from the fact that it is not enough for a
semantic theory whose theorems are T-sentences to yield true theorems;
the T-sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Snow is white&rdquo; is <em>T</em> in English iff grass is
green.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
is true, but tells us hardly anything about the meaning of &ldquo;Snow
is white&rdquo;. Rather, we want a semantic theory to entail, for each
sentence of the object language, exactly one <em>interpretive</em>
T-sentence: a T-sentence such that the sentence used on its right-hand
side gives the meaning of the sentence mentioned on its left-hand
side. Our theory must entail <em>at least one</em> such T-sentence for
each sentence in the object language because the aim is to give the
meaning of each sentence in the language; and it must entail <em>no
more than one</em> because, if the theory had as theorems more than
one T-sentence for a single sentence <em>S</em> of the object
language, an agent who knew all the theorems of the theory would not
yet understand <em>S</em>, since such an agent would not know which of
the T-sentences which mention <em>S</em> was interpretive.</p>

<p>
The problem is that it seems that any theory which implies at least
one T-sentence for every sentence of the language will also imply more
than one T-sentence for every sentence in the language. For any
sentences <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, if the theory entails a
T-sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>S</em> is <em>T</em> in <em>L</em> iff <em>p</em>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
then, since <em>p</em> is logically equivalent to \(p \amp \nsim(q
\amp \nsim q)\), the theory will also entail the T-sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>S</em> is <em>T</em> in <em>L</em> iff \(p \amp \nsim(q \amp \nsim
q)\),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
which, if the first is interpretive, won&rsquo;t be. But then the
theory will entail at least one non-interpretive T-sentence, and
someone who knows the theory will not know which of the relevant
sentences is interpretive and which not; such a person therefore would
not understand the language.</p>

<p>
The information problem is that, even if our semantic theory entails
all and only interpretive T-sentences, it is not the case that
knowledge of what is said by these theorems would suffice for
understanding the object language. For, it seems, I can know what is
said by a series of interpretive T-sentences without knowing that they
are interpretive. I may, for example, know what is said by the
interpretive T-sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Londres est jolie&rdquo; is <em>T</em> in French iff London is
pretty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
but still not know the meaning of the sentence mentioned on the
left-hand side of the T-sentence. The truth of what is said by this
sentence, after all, is compatible with the sentence used on the
right-hand side being materially equivalent to, but different in
meaning from, the sentence mentioned on the left. This seems to
indicate that knowing what is said by a truth theory of the relevant
kind is not, after all, sufficient for understanding a language. (For
replies to these criticisms, see Davidson (1976), Larson and Segal
(1995) and K&ouml;lbel (2001); for criticism of these replies, see
Soames (1992) and Ray (2014). For a reply to the latter, see
Kirk-Giannini and Lepore (2017).)</p>

<h4 id="InteSema">2.2.2 Internalist semantics</h4>

<p>
The Davidsonian, on one reading, diagnoses the mistake of classical
semantics in its commitment to a layer of content which goes beyond a
theory of reference. A different alternative to classical semantics
departs even more radically from that tradition, by denying that
mind-world reference relations should play any role in semantic
theorizing.</p>

<p>
This view is sometimes called &ldquo;internalist semantics&rdquo; by
contrast with views which locate the semantic properties of
expressions in their relation to elements of the external world. This
internalist approach to semantics is associated with the work of Noam
Chomsky (see especially Chomsky 2000).</p>

<p>
The internalist denies an assumption common to all of the approaches
discussed so far: the assumption that in giving the content of an
expression, we are primarily specifying something about that
expression&rsquo;s relation to things in the world which that
expression might be used to say things about. According to the
internalist, expressions as such don&rsquo;t bear any semantically
interesting relations to things in the world; names don&rsquo;t, for
example, <em>refer</em> to the objects with which one might take them
to be associated; predicates don&rsquo;t have extensions; sentences
don&rsquo;t have truth conditions. On this sort of view, we can use
sentences to say true or false things about the world, and can use
names to refer to things; but this is just one thing we can do with
names and sentences, and is not a claim about the meanings of those
expressions.</p>

<p>
So what are meanings, on this view? The most developed answer to this
question is given in Pietroski (2018), according to which
&ldquo;meanings are instructions for how to build concepts of a
special sort&rdquo; (2018: 36). By &ldquo;concepts&rdquo;, Pietroski
means mental representations of a certain kind. So the meaning of an
expression is an instruction to form a certain sort of mental
representation.</p>

<p>
On this kind of view, while concepts may have extensions, expressions
of natural languages do not. So this approach rejects not just the
details but the foundation of the classical approach to semantics
described above.</p>

<p>
One way to motivate an approach of this kind focuses on the ubiquity
of the phenomenon of polysemy in natural languages. As Pietroski
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We can use &ldquo;line&rdquo; to speak of Euclidean lines, fishing
lines, telephone lines, waiting lines, lines in faces, lines of
thought, etc. We can use &ldquo;door&rdquo; to access a concept of
certain impenetrable objects, or a concept of certain spaces that can
be occupied by such objects. (2018: 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The defender of the view that expressions have meanings which
determine extensions seems forced to say that &ldquo;line&rdquo; and
&ldquo;door&rdquo; are homophonous expressions, like
&ldquo;bank&rdquo;. But that seems implausible; when one uses the
expressions &ldquo;fishing line&rdquo; and &ldquo;line of
thought&rdquo; one seems to be using &ldquo;line&rdquo; in
recognizably the same sense. (This is a point of contrast with
standard examples of homophony, as when one uses &ldquo;bank&rdquo;
once to refer to a financial institution and then later to refer to
the side of a river.) Internalists, by contrast, are not forced into
treating these as cases of homophony; they can say that the meaning of
&ldquo;line&rdquo; is an instruction to fetch one of a family of
concepts.</p>

<p>
A second style of argument in favor of internalist semantics is based
on examples of natural language constructions which seem difficult to
handle if the meanings of expressions are contributions to truth
conditions. Pietroski (2003) gives the example of &lsquo;have/has
wheels.&rsquo; A natural thought is that a sentence &lsquo;__ has/have
wheels&rsquo; is true iff the relevant object (or objects) has (have)
at least one wheel. But that predicts, incorrectly, that
&lsquo;Bob&rsquo;s unicycle has wheels&rsquo; is true. The only
alternative seems to be to treat sentences of this form as true iff
the relevant object (or objects) has (have) at least two wheels. But
that predicts, incorrectly, that &lsquo;Unicycles have wheels&rsquo;
is false.</p>

<p>
For defenses and developments of internalist approaches to semantics,
see McGilvray (1998), Chomsky (2000), and Pietroski (2003, 2005,
2018). For a critical evaluation of the case for internalism, see King
(2017).</p>

<h4 id="InfeSema">2.2.3 Inferentialist semantics</h4>

<p>
Internalist semantics can be understood as denying the classical
semantic assumption that a semantic theory should assign truth
conditions to sentences. Another alternative to classical semantics
does not deny that assumption, but does deny that truth conditions
should play the fundamental role in semantics that classical semantics
give to them.</p>

<p>
This alternative is inferentialist semantics. The difference between
classical and inferentialist semantics is nicely put by Robert
Brandom:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The standard way [of classical semantics] is to assume that one has a
prior grip on the notion of truth, and use it to explain what good
inference consists in. &hellip; [I]nferentialist pragmatism reverses
this order of explanation &hellip; It starts with a practical
distinction between good and bad inferences, understood as a
distinction between appropriate and inappropriate doings, and goes on
to understand talk about truth as talk about what is preserved by the
good moves. (Brandom 2000: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The classical semanticist begins with certain language-world
representational relations, and uses these to explain the truth
conditions of sentences; we can then go on to use these truth
conditions to explain the difference between good and bad inferences.
The inferentialist, by contrast, begins with the distinction between
good and bad inferences, and tries to explain the representational
relations which the classical semanticist takes as (comparatively)
basic in inferentialist terms. (I say &ldquo;comparatively
basic&rdquo; because the classical semanticist might go on to provide
a reductive explanation of these representational relations, and the
inferentialist might go on to provide a reductive explanation of the
distinction between good and bad inferences.)</p>

<p>
As Brandom also emphasizes, the divergence between the classical and
inferentialist approaches to semantics arguably brings with it a
divergence on two other fundamental topics.</p>

<p>
The first is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic
properties of sentences, on the one hand, and subsentential
expressions, on the other. It is natural for the classical semanticist
to think that the representational relations between subsentential
expressions and their semantic contents can be explained independently
of the representational properties of sentences (i.e., their truth
conditions); the latter can thus be explained in terms of the former.
For the inferentialist, on the other hand, the semantic properties of
sentences must come first, because inferential relations hold between
sentences but not between subsentential expressions. (One cannot, for
example, infer one name from another.) So the inferentialist will not
explain the semantic properties of, for example, singular terms in
terms of representational relations between those singular terms and
items in the world; rather, she will explain what is distinctive of
singular terms in terms of their role in certain kinds of inferences.
(To see how this strategy might work, see Brandom 2000: Ch. 4.)</p>

<p>
The second is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic
properties of individual sentences, on the one hand, and the semantic
relations between sentences on the other. The classical semanticist
can, so to speak, explain the meanings of sentences one by one; there
is no difficulty in explaining the meaning of a sentence without
mentioning other sentences. By contrast, according to the
inferentialist,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if the conceptual content expressed by each sentence or word is
understood as essentially consisting in its inferential relations
(broadly construed) or articulated by its inferential relations
(narrowly construed), then one must grasp many such contents in order
to grasp any. (Brandom 2000: 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is sometimes called a &ldquo;holist&rdquo; approach to semantics. For
discussion of the pros and cons of this kind of view, see the entry on
 <a href="../meaning-holism/">meaning holism</a>.</p>
 
<p>
For book length defenses of inferentialism, see Brandom (1994) and
Brandom (2000). Important precursors include Wittgenstein (1953) and
Sellars (1968); see also the entries on

<h4 id="DynaSema">2.2.4 Dynamic semantics</h4>

<p>
In laying out the various versions of classical semantics, we said a
lot about sentences. By comparison, we said hardly anything about
conversations, or discourses. This is no accident; classical
approaches to semantics typically think of properties of conversations
or discourses as explicable in terms of explanatorily prior semantic
properties of sentences (even if classical semanticists do often take
the semantic contents of sentences to be sensitive to features of the
discourse in which they occur).</p>

<p>
Dynamic semantics is, to a first approximation, an approach to
semantics which reverses these explanatory priorities. (The sorts of
classical theories sketched above are, by contrast, called
&ldquo;static&rdquo; semantic theories.) On a dynamic approach, a
semantic theory does not aim primarily to deliver a pairing of
sentences with propositions which then determine the sentence&rsquo;s
truth conditions. Rather, according to these dynamic approaches to
semantics, the semantic values of sentences are rather &ldquo;context
change potentials&rdquo;&mdash;roughly, instructions for updating the
context, or discourse.</p>

<p>
In a dynamic context, many of the questions posed above about how best
to understand the nature of semantic contents show up instead as
questions about how best to understand the nature of contexts and
context change potentials. It is controversial not just whether a
dynamic or static approach to semantics is likely to be more fruitful,
but also what exactly the distinction between dynamic and static
systems comes to. (For discussion of the latter question, see
Rothschild &amp; Yalcin 2016.)</p>

<p>
A number of different linguistic phenomena have been thought to point
in the direction of a dynamic approach to semantics. One important
example involves unbound anaphora. Consider a discourse which includes
in sequence the following sentences:</p>

<p>
A man walked in.
<br />
He sat down.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rdquo; in the second sentence seems to be anaphoric on &ldquo;a man&rdquo; in the
first sentence. But on a non-dynamic, or static, approach to
semantics, this can look puzzling. &ldquo;A man&rdquo; is not a referring
expression, so it does not have as its semantic content an individual
to which &ldquo;he&rdquo; might refer. But &ldquo;he&rdquo; does not appear to be bound by &ldquo;a
man.&rdquo; On a dynamic approach, this commonplace phenomenon might be
handled by taking part of the meaning of the first sentence to be the
addition of a &ldquo;discourse referent&rdquo; to the context, which &ldquo;he&rdquo; in the
second sentence can then pick up on. Here a discourse referent is
something like a placeholder or variable introduced into the
conversation; later contributions to the conversation can then
predicate further properties of this individual.</p>

<p>
The relationship between dynamic semantics and classical semantics is
different than the relationship between the latter and the other
alternatives to classical semantics that I&rsquo;ve discussed. The
other alternatives to classical semantics reject some core feature of
classical semantics&mdash;for example, the assignments of entities as
meanings, or the idea that meaning centrally involves language-world
relations. By contrast, dynamic semantics can be thought of as a kind
of extension or generalization of classical semantics, which can
employ modified versions of much of the same theoretical
machinery.</p>

<p>
Foundational works in this tradition include Irene Heim&rsquo;s file
change semantics (1982) and Hans Kamp&rsquo;s
 <a href="../discourse-representation-theory/">discourse representation theory (see entry)</a>.
 For more details on different versions of this alternative to
classical semantics, see the entry on
 <a href="../dynamic-semantics/">dynamic semantics</a>.
 For critical discussion of the motivations for dynamic semantics, see
Karen Lewis (2014). For discussion of the extent to which dynamic and
static approaches are really in competition, see Stojni&#263;
(2019).</p>

<h4 id="ExprSema">2.2.5 Expressivist semantics</h4>

<p>
A final alternative to classical semantics differs from those
discussed in the preceding four subsections in two (related)
respects.</p>

<p>
The first is that, unlike the other non-classical approaches,
expressivist semantics was originally not motivated by linguistic
considerations. Rather, it was developed in response to specifically
metaethical considerations. A number of philosophers held metaethical
views which made it hard for them to see how a classical semantic
treatment of sentences about ethics could be correct, and so developed
expressivism as an alternative treatment of these parts of
language.</p>

<p>
This leads to a second difference between expressivist and our other
four alternatives to classical semantics. The latter are all
&ldquo;global alternatives&rdquo;, in the sense that they propose
non-classical approaches to the semantics of all of a natural
language. By contrast, expressivists often agree that classical
semantics (or one of the other non-expressivist alternatives to it
discussed in
 <a href="#DaviSema">&sect;&sect;2.2.1&ndash;4</a>)
 is correct for many parts of language; they just think that special
features of some parts of language require expressivist treatment.</p>

<p>
One can think of many traditional versions of expressivism, which were
motivated by metaethical concerns, as involving two basic ideas.
First, we can explain the meaning of a sentence by saying what mental
state that sentence expresses. Second, the mental state expressed by a
sentence about ethics (or of whatever category of sentence the
expressivist treatment is being offered) is different in kind from the
mental state expressed by a &ldquo;factual&rdquo; sentence.</p>

<p>
Two follow up questions suggest themselves. One is about what
&ldquo;expresses&rdquo; means here; for one answer, see Gibbard
(1990). A second is about what the relevant difference in mental
states consists in. On many views, the mental states expressed by
non-ethical sentences are beliefs, whereas the mental states expressed
by ethical sentences are not. Different versions of expressivism
propose different candidates for the mental states which are expressed
by ethical sentences. Prominent candidates include exclamations (Ayer
1936), commands (Hare 1952), and plans (Gibbard 1990, 2003).</p>

<p>
A classic problem for expressivist theories of the kind just sketched
comes from interactions between ethical and non-ethical bits of
language. This problem has come to be known as the Frege-Geach
problem, because a very influential version of the problem was posed
by Geach (1960, 1965). (A version of the problem is also independently
presented in Searle 1962.) In one of its versions, the problem comes
in two parts. First, whatever mental state expressivists take ethical
sentences to express will typically not be expressed by complex
sentences which embed the relevant ethical sentence. So even if</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Lying is wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
expresses the mental state of planning not to lie, the same sentence
when embedded in the conditional</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
If lying is wrong, then what Jane did was wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
does not. After all, one can endorse this conditional without
endorsing a plan not to lie. So it seems that the expressivist must
say that &ldquo;lying is wrong&rdquo; means something different when
it occurs alone than it does when it occurs in the antecedent of a
conditional. The problem, though, is that if one takes that view it is
hard to see how it could follow from the above two sentences, as it
surely does, that</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
What Jane did was wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
For a discussion of solutions to this problem, and an influential
critique of expressivism, see Schroeder (2008).</p>

<p>
Much recent work on expressivism is both less focused on the special
case of ethics, and more motivated by purely linguistic
considerations, than has often been the case traditionally. Examples
include discussions of expressivism about epistemic modality in Yalcin
(2007), about knowledge ascriptions in Moss (2013), and about
vagueness in MacFarlane (2016).</p>

<h3 id="GeneQuesFaciSemaTheo">2.3 General Questions Facing Semantic Theories</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, the aim of &sect;2 of this entry is to discuss
issues about the form which a semantic theory should take which are at
a higher level of abstraction than issues about the correct semantic
treatment of particular expression-types. But there are some general
issues in semantics which, while more general than questions about
how, for example, the semantics of adverbs should go, are largely
(though not wholly) orthogonal to the question of which of the
frameworks for semantic theorizing laid out in &sect;2.1 and
&sect;2.2 should be adopted. The present subsection introduces a
few of these.</p>

<h4 id="HowMuchContSens">2.3.1 How much context-sensitivity?</h4>

<p>

 <a href="#CharContContCirc">&sect;2.1.4</a>
 introduced the idea that some expressions might be context-sensitive,
or indexical. Within a propositional semantics, we&rsquo;d say that
these expressions have different contents relative to distinct
contexts; but the phenomenon of context-sensitivity is one which any
semantic theory must recognize. A very general question which is both
highly important and orthogonal to the above distinctions between
types of semantic theories is: How much context-sensitivity is there
in natural languages?</p>

<p>
Virtually everyone recognizes a sort of core group of indexicals,
including &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;here&rdquo;, and &ldquo;now&rdquo;.
Most also think of demonstratives, like (some uses of)
&ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rdquo;, as indexicals. But whether
and how this list should be extended is a matter of controversy. Some
popular candidates for inclusion are:</p>

<ul>

<li>devices of quantification</li>

<li>gradable adjectives</li>

<li>alethic modals, including counterfactual conditionals</li>

<li>&ldquo;knows&rdquo; and epistemic modals</li>

<li>propositional attitude ascriptions</li>

<li>&ldquo;good&rdquo; and other moral terms</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many philosophers and linguists think that one or more of these
categories of expressions are indexicals. Indeed, some think that
virtually every natural language expression is context-sensitive.</p>

<p>
Questions about context-sensitivity are important, not just for
semantics, but for many areas of philosophy. And that is because some
of the terms thought to be context-sensitive are terms which play a
central role in describing the subject matter of other areas of
philosophy.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most prominent example here is the role that the view that
&ldquo;knows&rdquo; is an indexical has played in recent epistemology.
This view is often called &ldquo;contextualism about knowledge&rdquo;;
and in general, the view that some term <em>F</em> is an indexical is
often called &ldquo;contextualism about <em>F</em>&rdquo;.
Contextualism about knowledge is of interest in part because it
promises to provide a kind of middle ground between two opposing
epistemological positions: the skeptical view that we know hardly
anything about our surroundings, and the dogmatist view that we can
know that we are not in various Cartesian skeptical scenarios. (So,
for example, the dogmatist holds that I can know that I am not a brain
in a vat which is, for whatever reason, being made to have the series
of experiences subjectively indistinguishable from the experiences I
actually have.) Both of these positions can seem
unappealing&mdash;skepticism because it does seem that I can
occasionally know, e.g., that I am sitting down, and dogmatism because
it&rsquo;s hard to see how I can rule out the possibility that I am in
a skeptical scenario subjectively indistinguishable from my actual
situation.</p>

<p>
But the disjunction of these positions can seem, not just unappealing,
but inevitable; for the proposition that I am sitting entails that I
am not a brain in a vat, and it&rsquo;s hard to see&mdash;presuming
that I know that this entailment holds&mdash;how I could know the
former without thereby being in a position to know the latter. The
contextualist about &ldquo;knows&rdquo; aims to provide the answer:
the extension of &ldquo;knows&rdquo; depends on features of the
context of utterance. Perhaps&mdash;to take one among many possible
contextualist views&mdash;a pair of a subject and a proposition
<em>p</em> will be in the extension of &ldquo;knows&rdquo; relative to
a context only if that subject is able to rule out every possibility
which is both (i) inconsistent with <em>p</em> and (ii) salient in
<em>C</em>. The idea is that &ldquo;I know that I am sitting
down&rdquo; can be true in a normal setting, simply because the
possibility that I am a brain in a vat is not normally salient; but
typically &ldquo;I know that I am not a brain in a vat&rdquo; will be
false, since discussion of skeptical scenarios makes them salient, and
(if the skeptical scenario is well-designed) I will lack the evidence
needed to rule them out. See for discussion, among many other places,
the entry on
 <a href="../contextualism-epistemology/">epistemic contextualism</a>,
 Cohen (1986), DeRose (1992), and David Lewis (1996).</p>

<p>
Having introduced one important contextualist thesis, let&rsquo;s
return to the general question which faces the semantic theorist,
which is: How do we tell when an expression is context-sensitive?
Contextualism about knowledge, it would seem, can hardly get off the
ground unless &ldquo;knows&rdquo; really is a context-sensitive
expression. &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;here&rdquo; wear their
context-sensitivity on their sleeves; but &ldquo;knows&rdquo; does
not. What sort of argument would suffice to show that an expression is
an indexical?</p>

<p>
Philosophers and linguists disagree about the right answers to this
question. The difficulty of coming up with a suitable diagnostic is
illustrated by considering one intuitively plausible test, defended in
Chapter 7 of Cappelen &amp; Lepore (2005). This test says that an
expression is an indexical iff it characteristically blocks
disquotational reports of what a speaker said in cases in which the
original speech and the disquotational report are uttered in contexts
which differ with respect to the relevant contextual parameter. (Or,
more cautiously, that this test provides evidence that a given
expression is, or is not, context-sensitive.)</p>

<p>
This test clearly counts obvious indexicals as such. Consider
&ldquo;I&rdquo;. Suppose that Mary utters</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
I am hungry.</p>
</div>

<p>
One sort of disquotational report of Mary&rsquo;s speech would use the
very sentence Mary uttered in the complement of a &ldquo;says&rdquo;
ascription. So suppose that Sam attempts such a disquotational report
of what Mary said, and utters</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Mary said that I am hungry.</p>
</div>

<p>
The report is obviously false; Mary said that Mary is hungry, not that
Sam is. The falsity of Sam&rsquo;s report suggests that &ldquo;I am
hungry&rdquo; has a different content out of Mary&rsquo;s mouth than
out of Sam&rsquo;s; and this, in turn, suggests that &ldquo;I&rdquo;
has a different content when uttered by Mary than when uttered by Sam.
Hence, it suggests that &ldquo;I&rdquo; is an indexical.</p>

<p>
It isn&rsquo;t just that this test gives the right result in many
cases; it&rsquo;s also that the test fits nicely with the plausible
view that an utterance of a sentence of the form &ldquo;<em>A</em>
said that <em>S</em>&rdquo; in a context <em>C</em> is true iff the
content of <em>S</em> in <em>C</em> is the same as the content of what
the referent of &ldquo;<em>A</em>&rdquo; said (on the relevant
occasion).</p>

<p>
The interesting uses of this test are not uses which show that
&ldquo;I&rdquo; is an indexical; we already knew that. The interesting
use of this test, as Cappelen and Lepore argue, is to show that many
of the expressions which have been taken to be indexicals&mdash;like
the ones on the list given above&mdash;are <em>not</em>
context-sensitive. For we can apparently employ disquotational reports
of the relevant sort to report utterances using quantifiers, gradable
adjectives, modals, &ldquo;knows&rdquo;, etc. This test thus
apparently shows that no expressions beyond the obvious
ones&mdash;&ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;here&rdquo;, &ldquo;now&rdquo;,
etc.&mdash;are genuinely context-sensitive.</p>

<p>
But, as Hawthorne (2006) argues, naive applications of this test seem
to lead to unacceptable results. Terms for relative directions, like
&ldquo;left&rdquo;, seem to be almost as obviously context-sensitive
as &ldquo;I&rdquo;; the direction picked out by simple uses of
&ldquo;left&rdquo; depends on the orientation of the speaker of the
context. But we can typically use &ldquo;left&rdquo; in disquotational
&ldquo;says&rdquo; reports of the relevant sort. Suppose, for example,
that Mary says</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The coffee machine is to the left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sam can later truly report Mary&rsquo;s speech by saying</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Mary said that the coffee machine was to the left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
despite the fact that Sam&rsquo;s orientation in the context of the
ascription differs from Mary&rsquo;s orientation in the context of the
reported utterance. Hence our test seems to lead to the absurd result
that &ldquo;left&rdquo; is not context-sensitive.</p>

<p>
One interpretation of this puzzling fact is that our test using
disquotational &ldquo;says&rdquo; ascriptions is a bit harder to apply
than one might have thought. For, to apply it, one needs to be sure
that the context of the ascription really does differ from the context
of the original utterance <em>in the value of the relevant contextual
parameter</em>. And in the case of disquotational reports using
&ldquo;left&rdquo;, one might think that examples like the above show
that the relevant contextual parameter is sometimes not the
orientation of the speaker, but rather the orientation of the subject
of the ascription at the time of the relevant utterance.</p>

<p>
This is but one criterion for context-sensitivity. But discussion of
this criterion brings out the fact that the reliability of an
application of a test for context-sensitivity will in general not be
independent of the space of views one might take about the contextual
parameters to which a given expression is sensitive. For a discussion
of ways in which we might revise tests for context-sensitivity using
disquotational reports which are sensitive to the above data, see
Cappelen &amp; Hawthorne (2009). For a critical survey of other
proposed tests for context-sensitivity, see Cappelen &amp; Lepore
(2005: Part I).</p>

<p>
This is just an introduction to one central issue concerning the
relationship between context and semantic content. A sampling of other
influential works on this topic includes Sperber and Wilson (1995),
Carston (2002), Recanati (2004, 2010), Bezuidenhout (2002), and the
essays in Stanley (2007).</p>

<h4 id="HowManyIndi">2.3.2 How many indices?</h4>

<p>

 <a href="#PossWorlSema">&sect;2.1.5</a>
 introduced the idea of an expression determining a reference,
relative to a context, with respect to a particular circumstance of
evaluation. But that discussion left the notion of a circumstance of
evaluation rather underspecified. One might want to know more about
what, exactly, these circumstances of evaluation involve&mdash;and
hence about what sorts of things the reference of an expression can
(once we&rsquo;ve fixed a context) vary with respect to.</p>

<p>
One way to focus this question is to stay at the level of sentences,
and imagine that we have fixed on a sentence <em>S</em>, with a
certain character, and context <em>C</em>. If sentences express
propositions relative to contexts, then <em>S</em> will express some
proposition <em>P</em> relative to <em>C</em>. If the determination of
reference in general depends not just on character and context, but
also on circumstance, then we know that <em>P</em> might have
different truth-values relative to different circumstances of
evaluation. Our question is: exactly what must we specify in order to
determine <em>P</em>&rsquo;s truth-value?</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s say that an <em>index</em> is the sort of thing which, for
some proposition <em>P</em>, we must at least sometimes specify in
order to determine P&rsquo;s truth-value. Given this usage, we can
think of circumstances of evaluation&mdash;the things which play the
theoretical role outlined in
 <a href="#PossWorlSema">&sect;2.1.5</a>&mdash;as
 made up of indices.</p>

<p>
The most uncontroversial candidate for an index is a world, because
most advocates of a propositional semantics think that propositions
can have different truth-values with respect to different possible
worlds. The main question is whether circumstances of evaluation need
contain any indices other than a possible world.</p>

<p>
The most popular candidate for a second index is a time. The view that
propositions can have different truth-values with respect to different
times&mdash;and hence that we need a time index&mdash;is often called
&ldquo;temporalism&rdquo;. The negation of temporalism is
eternalism.</p>

<p>
The motivations for temporalism are both metaphysical and semantic. On
the metaphysical side, A-theorists about time (see the entry on
 <a href="../time/">time</a>)
 think that corresponding to predicates like &ldquo;is a child&rdquo;
are A-series properties which a thing can have at one time, and lack
at another time. (Hence, on this view, the property corresponding to
&ldquo;is a child&rdquo; is not a property like <em>being a child in
2014</em>, since that is a property which a thing has permanently if
at all, and hence is a B-series rather than A-series property.) But
then it looks like the proposition expressed by &ldquo;Violet is a
child&rdquo;&mdash;which predicates this A-series property of
Violet&mdash;should have different truth-values with respect to
different times. And this is enough to motivate the view that we
should have an index for a time.</p>

<p>
On the semantic side, as Kaplan (1989a) notes, friends of the idea
that tenses are best modeled as operators have good reason to include
a time index in circumstances of evaluation. After all, operators
operate on contents, so if there are temporal operators, they will
only be able to affect truth-values if those contents can have
different truth-values with respect to different times.</p>

<p>
A central challenge for the view that propositions can change
truth-value over time is whether the proponent of this view can make
sense of retention of propositional attitudes over time. For suppose
that I believe in 2014 that Violet is a child. Intuitively, I might
hold fixed all of my beliefs about Violet for the next 40 years,
without its being true, in 2054, that I have the obviously false
belief that Violet is still a child. But the temporalist, who thinks
of the proposition that Violet is a child as something which
incorporates no reference to a time and changes truth-value over time,
seems stuck with this result. Problems of this sort for temporalism
are developed in Richard (1981); for a response see Sullivan
(2014).</p>

<p>
Motivations for eternalism are also both metaphysical and semantic.
Those attracted to B-theories of time will take propositions to have
their truth-values eternally, which makes inclusion of a time index
superfluous. And those who think that tenses are best modeled in terms
of quantification over times rather than using tense operators will,
similarly, see no use for a time index. For a defense of the
quantificational over the operator analysis of tense, see King
(2003).</p>

<p>
There are also views according to which the truth-value of
propositions can vary over indices other than world and time. These
are sometimes called <em>relativist</em> views. According to one
relativist semantic theory, our indices should include not just a
world and (perhaps) a time, but also a <em>context of assessment</em>.
Just as propositions can have different truth values with respect to
different worlds, so, on this view, they can vary in their truth
depending upon features of the conversational setting in which they
are considered.</p>

<p>
The motivations for this sort of view can be illustrated by a type of
example whose importance is emphasized in Egan et al. (2005). Suppose
that, at the beginning of a murder investigation inquiry, I say</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The murderer might have been on campus at midnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It looks like the proposition expressed by this sentence will be true,
roughly, if we don&rsquo;t know anything which rules out the murderer
having been on campus at midnight. But now suppose that more
information comes in, some of which rules out the murderer having been
on campus at midnight. At this point, it seems, I could truly say</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What I said was false&mdash;the murderer couldn&rsquo;t have been on
campus at midnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But this is puzzling. It is not puzzling that the sentence &ldquo;The
murderer might have been on campus at midnight&rdquo; could be true
when uttered in the first context but false when uttered in the second
context; that fact could be accommodated by any number of
contextualist treatments of epistemic modals, which would dissolve the
puzzle by saying that the sentence expresses different propositions
relative to the two contexts. The puzzle is that the truth of the
second sentence seems to imply that the proposition expressed by the
first&mdash;which we agreed was true relative to that context&mdash;is
false relative to the second context. Here we don&rsquo;t have (or
don&rsquo;t just have) sentences varying in truth-value depending on
context; we seem to have propositions varying in truth-value depending
on context. The relativist about epistemic modals takes appearance
here to be reality, and holds that, in addition to worlds (and maybe
times), propositions can sometimes differ in their truth-value
relative to contexts of assessment (roughly, the context in which the
proposition is being considered). (Note that it is not essential to
the case that the two contexts of assessment are at different times;
much the same intuitions can be generated by considering cases of
&ldquo;eavesdropping&rdquo;, in which one party overhears the
utterance of some other group which lacks some of its evidence.)</p>

<p>
Relativist treatments of various expressions have also been motivated
by certain apparent facts about disagreement. Lasersohn (2005)
considers the example of predicates of personal taste. He points out
that we&rsquo;re often inclined to think that, if our tastes differ
sufficiently, my utterance of &ldquo;That soup is tasty&rdquo; can be
true even while your utterance of &ldquo;That soup is not tasty&rdquo;
is also true. As above, this fact by itself is not especially
surprising, and might seem to cry out for a contextualist treatment of
&ldquo;tasty&rdquo;. But the puzzling thing is that, despite the fact
that we think that each of us are uttering sentences which express
true propositions, we seem to be disagreeing with each other. (You
might say, after overhearing me, &ldquo;<em>No</em>, that soup is not
tasty&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>
The contrast here with indexicals is apparently quite sharp. If I say
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;re not hungry,
you&rsquo;d never reply to my utterance by saying &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m
not hungry&rdquo;&mdash;precisely because it&rsquo;s obvious that we
would not be disagreeing. So again we have a puzzle: a puzzle about
how each of our &ldquo;soup&rdquo; sentences could express true
propositions, despite those propositions contradicting each other.
Relativism suggests an answer: these propositions are only true or
false relative to individuals. The one I express is true relative to
me, and its negation is true relative to you; they&rsquo;re
contradictory in the sense that it is impossible for both to be true
relative to the same individual (at the same time).</p>

<p>
It is controversial whether any of these relativist arguments are
convincing. For more discussion, see the discussion of &ldquo;new
relativism&rdquo; in the entry on
 <a href="../relativism/">relativism</a>.
 For an explication of relativism and its application to various kinds
of discourse, see MacFarlane (2014). For an extended critique of
relativism, see Cappelen &amp; Hawthorne (2009).</p>

<h4 id="WhatProp">2.3.3 What are propositions?</h4>

<p>
Classical approaches to semantics supply propositions as the contents
of sentences relative to contexts. But it is notable that of the three
families of classical views canvassed above, only one&mdash;possible
worlds semantics&mdash;actually tells us what propositions are. (Even
in that case, of course, one might ask what possible worlds are, and
hence what propositions are sets <em>of</em>. See the entry on
 <a href="../possible-worlds/">possible worlds</a>.)
 Russellian and Fregean views, as laid out above, make claims about
what sorts of things are the constituents of propositions&mdash;but
don&rsquo;t tell us what the structured propositions so constituted
are.</p>

<p>
There are really two questions here. One is the question: what does it
mean to say that <em>x</em> is a constituent of a proposition? The
language of constituency suggests parthood; but there&rsquo;s some
reason to think that <em>x</em>&rsquo;s being a constituent of a
proposition isn&rsquo;t a matter of <em>x</em>&rsquo;s being a part of
that proposition. This is perhaps clearest on a Russellian view,
according to which ordinary physical objects can be constituents of
propositions. The problem is that a thing can be a constituent of a
proposition without every part of that thing being a constituent of
that proposition; a proposition with me as a constituent, it seems,
need not also have every single molecule that now composes me as a
constituent. But that fact is inconsistent with the idea that
constituency is parthood and the plausible assumption that parthood is
transitive. For discussion of this and other problems, see Gilmore
(2014), Keller (2013), and Merricks (2015).</p>

<p>
Hence the proponent of structured propositions owes some account of
what &ldquo;structure&rdquo; and &ldquo;constituent&rdquo; talk
amounts to in this domain. And it seems unattractive to take these
notions as primitive, since it would then be very unclear what
explanatory value the claim that propositions are structured could
have.</p>

<p>
The second, in some ways more fundamental, question, is: What sort of
thing are propositions? To what metaphysical category do they belong?
The simplest and most straightforward answer to this question is:
&ldquo;They belong to the <em>sui generis</em> category of
propositions&rdquo;. On this view, the category of propositions is a
primitive category in our ontology. This view is defended by Plantinga
(1974), Merricks (2015), and Keller (2022). Proponents of this view
typically deny that propositions have constituents; but one can still
raise the question of how fine-grained propositions are. So, while the
primitivist will not go in for the &ldquo;structure&rdquo; talk employed by many
Fregeans and Russellians, there could be versions of primitivism which
endorse Frege&rsquo;s criterion of difference for sense, or versions
which accept individuation conditions for propositions more like those
accepted by the Russellian.</p>

<p>
But many philosophers have sought to give different answers to the
question of what propositions are, by trying to explain how
propositions could be members of some other ontological category in
which we have independent reason to believe.</p>

<p>
According to one view, propositions are a kind of fact. This view was,
on some interpretations, advocated by Russell (1903) and Wittgenstein
(1922). A more recent defender of this view is Jeffrey King. On his
version of the view, propositions (at least the propositions expressed
by sentences) are meta-linguistic facts about sentences. At a first
pass, and ignoring some important subtleties, the proposition
expressed by the sentence &ldquo;Amelia talks&rdquo; will be the fact
that there is some language <em>L</em>, some expression <em>x</em>,
some expression <em>y</em>, and some syntactic relation <em>R</em>
such that <em>R</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>), <em>x</em> has Amelia as
its semantic value, <em>y</em> has the property of talking as its
semantic value, and <em>R</em> encodes ascription. See for development
and defense of this view King (2007, 2014a).</p>

<p>
According to a second sort of view, propositions are kind of property.
Versions of this view vary both according to which properties they
take propositions to be, and what they take propositions to be
properties of. This view is associated with David Lewis (1979) and
Chisholm (1981), who took the objects of propositional attitudes to be
properties which the bearer of the attitude ascribes to him- or
herself. Other versions of the view are defended by van Inwagen (2004)
and Gilmore (2022), who take propositions to be 0-place relations, and
Richard (2013) and Speaks (2014), who take propositions to be monadic
properties of certain sorts.</p>

<p>
According to a third sort of view, propositions are entities which
are, or owe their existence to, the mental acts of subjects. While
their views differ in many ways, both Hanks (2007, 2011) and Soames
(2010, 2014) think of propositions as acts of predication. In the
simplest case&mdash;a monadic predication&mdash;the proposition will
be the act of predicating a property of an object.</p>

<p>
A fourth and quite different approach to thinking about propositions
can be found in recent work in &lsquo;higher-order metaphysics.&rsquo;
Very roughly, proponents of higher-order metaphysics hold that there
are irreducibly distinct metaphysical types which correspond to
linguistic types. So, for example, the type of thing which corresponds
to a singular term &ndash; an object &ndash; is distinct from the type
of thing which corresponds to a predicate or sentence. In this
context, it is natural to think of propositions as the type
corresponding to sentences. From this perspective, all of the
approaches just sketched &ndash; which identify propositions with sets,
cognitive acts, facts, etc. &ndash; make a fundamental mistake. They all
identify propositions with objects &ndash; things that can be picked
out by singular terms &ndash; whereas propositions are of a different
metaphysical type entirely. Arguably, a version of this view can be
found in Frege (1892b [1951]); for a recent defense, see Jones (2019).
For a sympathetic but critical discussion of the approach, see
Lederman (2024).</p>

<p>
There are other views as well. For any overview of theories of
propositions, see the essays collected in Tillman &amp; Murray
(2022).</p>

<h2 id="MetaTheo">3. Metasemantic theories</h2>

<p>
We now turn to our second sort of &ldquo;theory of meaning&rdquo;:
metasemantic theories, which are attempts to specify the facts in
virtue of which expressions of natural languages come to have the
semantic properties that they have.</p>

<p>
The use of &lsquo;metasemantics&rsquo; in this context is traceable to
David Kaplan:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact that a word or phrase *has* a certain meaning clearly belongs
to semantics. On the other hand, a claim about the basis for ascribing
a certain meaning to a word or phrase does not belong to semantics.
&ldquo;Ohsnay&rdquo; means snow in Pig&#8208;Latin. That&rsquo;s a
semantic fact about Pig&#8208;Latin. The reason why
&ldquo;ohsnay&rdquo; means snow is not a semantic fact; it is some
kind of historical or sociological fact about Pig&#8208;Latin. ...
perhaps, because it is a fact about semantics, [it should be
categorized] as part of the Metasemantics of Pig&#8208;Latin (or
perhaps, for those who prefer working from below to working from
above, as part of the Foundations of semantics of Pig&#8208;Latin).
(Kaplan (1989b), 573&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The question which metasemantic theories try to answer is a common
sort of question in philosophy. In the philosophy of
 <a href="../action/">action (see entry)</a>
 we ask what the facts are in virtue of which a given piece of
behavior is an intentional action; in questions about
 <a href="../identity-personal/">personal identity (see entry)</a>
 we ask what the facts are in virtue of which <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> are the same person; in ethics we ask what the facts are in
virtue of which a given action is morally right or wrong. In
metasemantics we ask a parallel question about meaning.</p>

<p>
It is worth flagging the fact that in the contemporary literature,
&lsquo;metasemantics&rsquo; is used in two different, if related,
ways. The distinction can be illustrated by thinking about a simple
context-sensitive expression, like &lsquo;that.&rsquo; This expression
has different contents in different contexts of use. Competent
speakers are able to figure out what content it has in different
contexts of use; so, plausibly, our linguistic competence includes
implicit grasp of some rule which, for arbitrary contexts of use,
determines a content for &lsquo;that.&rsquo; This rule would seem to
be what (in section 2.1.4) we called a &lsquo;character&rsquo;: a
function from contexts to contents. Sometimes the task of explicating
this function is called giving a &lsquo;metasemantics for
demonstratives.&rsquo; We can also ask this question about
non-context-sensitive expressions; but the metasemantics, in this
sense, of such expressions is easy and boring. After all, the
characters of these expressions are just constant functions.</p>

<p>
But we can ask another question about &lsquo;that,&rsquo; which
remains even if we have in hand a satisfactory explication of the
character of the expression. We can ask what facts about language
users explain the fact that &lsquo;that&rsquo; is an expression with
that character. After all, presumably it could have been a
context-sensitive expression with a different character; for that
matter, it could have been a name or sentence connective; or it could
have lacked any meaning at all. When we ask this sort of metasemantic
question about &lsquo;that,&rsquo; we are, as Kaplan says, looking for
the historical or sociological (or psychological) facts which explain
the fact that &lsquo;that&rsquo; has the semantic properties that it
has. Notice that when we ask this sort of metasemantic question about
non-context-sensitive expressions, the answer is not easy or boring;
it is (as we will see) very unobvious what explains a name or
predicate having the content that it has.</p>

<p>
The two uses of &lsquo;metasemantics&rsquo; are related: both are
attempts to explain the facts in virtue of which expressions have in
certain contexts of use the contents that they have. But they provide
different parts of that explanation. For that reason, they are
(arguably) subject to different constraints. As already mentioned, it
is plausible that speakers have must have some sort of implicit grasp
of the character of context-sensitive expressions (and so of their
metasemantics in the first sense). By contrast there is no more reason
to think that ordinary speakers must have an implicit grasp of the
metasemantics of expressions in the second sense than there is to
think that ordinary speakers have an implicit grasp of the answers to
other questions in metaphysics.</p>

<p>
This section focuses on the main approaches to metasemantics in the
second sense. (For a brief survey of different approaches to
metasemantics in the first sense, see section &sect;2.1.4; see also
the entry on
 <a href="../indexicals/">indexicals</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Even if the kind of question metasemantic theories are trying to
answer is common in philosophy, it is not obvious what the constraints
are on answers to these sorts of questions, or when we should expect
questions of this sort to have interesting answers. Accordingly, one
sort of approach to metasemantics is simply to deny that there is any
true informative account of the nature of meaning. One might be quite
willing to endorse one of the semantic theories outlined above while
also holding that facts about the meanings of expressions are
primitive, in the sense that there is no systematic story to be told
about the facts in virtue of which expressions have the meanings that
they have. (See, for example, Johnston 1988.)</p>

<p>
There is another reason why one might be pessimistic about the current
prospects of metasemantics. While plainly distinct from semantics, the
attempt to provide a metasemantic theory is clearly in one sense
answerable to semantic theorizing, since without a clear view of the
facts about the semantic contents of expressions we won&rsquo;t have a
clear view of the facts for which we are trying to provide an
explanation. One might, then, be skeptical about the prospects of
metasemantics not because of a general primitivist view of semantic
facts, but just because one holds that natural language semantics is
not yet advanced enough for us to have a clear grip on the semantic
facts which metasemantic theories aim to analyze. (See for discussion
Yalcin (2014).)</p>

<p>
Many philosophers have, however, attempted to construct metasemantic
theories. Most of these philosophers have been working within a
classical, or at least broadly truth-conditional, approach to
semantics. So most of these philosophers have taken their aims to
include an explanation of the facts in virtue of which sentences in
contexts have the truth conditions that they do.</p>

<p>
The purpose of this section is to lay out the main approaches to
constructing a theory of this kind. But it is worth flagging the fact
that the task of metasemantics may look quite different if one is not
working with this conception of what the semantic facts are. Suppose,
for example, that one adopts the internalist idea that the meanings of
linguistic expressions are instructions for building or accessing
certain mental representations. It is not implausible to think that
this might considerably simplify the task of metasemantic theorizing;
perhaps the metasemantic story could be as simple as an inventory of
the relevant language user&rsquo;s dispositions to access certain
representations when encountering the target linguistic
expression.</p>

<p>
The most popular approaches to metasemantics explain the semantic
properties of linguistic expressions at least partly in terms of facts
about mental representation. Some hold that expressions simply inherit
their meanings from the contents of mental states to which they stand
in some suitable relation (to be specified by the theory). Others do
not hold this sort of inheritance view, but still give the intentions
or other mental states of language users a role to play in
metasemantics. We might call metasemantic theories which make use of
facts about the contents of mental states of language users
&ldquo;mentalist&rdquo; approaches to metasemantics.</p>

<p>
For philosophers who are interested in explaining content, or
representation, in non-representational terms, mentalist theories can
only be a first step in the task of giving an ultimate explanation of
the foundations of linguistic representation. The second, and more
fundamental explanation would then come at the level of a theory of
mental content. (For an overview of theories of this sort, see entry
on
 <a href="../mental-representation/">mental representation</a>.)
 Indeed, the popularity of mentalist theories of linguistic meaning,
along with the conviction that content should be explicable in
non-representational terms, is an important reason why so much
attention has been focused on theories of mental representation over
the last few decades.</p>

<h3 id="MeanBeliConv">3.1 Meaning, belief, and convention</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most popular approach to metasemantics builds on the
groundbreaking work of David Lewis (1975). According to this view,
there are in language communities regularities connecting utterances
of sentences with beliefs of language users. When these regularities
are conventions, they ground the meanings of the relevant sentences in
the contents of the beliefs to which those sentences are
connected.</p>

<p>
In Lewis&rsquo; version of the theory, the key regularities are
regularities of truthfulness and trust. The regularity of truthfulness
connects a sentence <em>S</em> with the belief <em>p</em> just in case
members of the community will not utter <em>S</em> unless they believe
<em>p</em>. The regularity of trust connects <em>S</em> with the
belief <em>p</em> just in case members of the community will come to
believe <em>p</em> when they hear another member of the community
utter <em>S</em>.</p>

<p>
Roughly, a regularity is a matter of convention when the regularity
obtains because there is something akin to an agreement among a group
of people to keep the regularity in place. So, applied to our present
example, the idea would be (again roughly) that for a sentence
<em>S</em> to express a proposition <em>p</em> in some group is for
there to be something like an agreement in that group to maintain some
sort of regularity between utterances of <em>S</em> and agents&rsquo;
believing <em>p</em>. There are different ways to make this rough idea
precise (see the entry on
 <a href="../convention/">convention</a>).
 According to one important kind of view, a sentence <em>S</em>
expresses the proposition <em>p</em> if and only if the following
three conditions are satisfied: (1) speakers typically utter
<em>S</em> only if they believe <em>p</em> and typically come to
believe <em>p</em> upon hearing <em>S</em>, (2) members of the
community believe that (1) is true, and (3) the fact that members of
the community believe that (1) is true, and believe that other members
of the community believe that (1) is true, gives them a good reason to
go on acting so as to make (1) true. (This a simplified version of the
theory defended in David Lewis 1975.)</p>

<p>
This brief sketch leaves many important questions unanswered. How does
the theory handle the fact that speakers are not always truthful, and
hearers not always trusting? How can the theory handle sentences which
are never uttered? How can the theory handle indexical sentences,
which express different propositions in different contexts of use?
Williams (2021, Part II) gives the fullest development of this
Lewisian approach to metasemantics. For critical discussion of this
sort of analysis of meaning, see Burge 1975, Hawthorne 1990, Laurence
1996, Schiffer 2006.</p>

<h3 id="GricProg">3.2 The Gricean program</h3>

<p>

 <a href="../grice/">Paul Grice</a>
 developed an analysis of meaning which can be thought of as the
conjunction of two claims: (1) facts about what expressions mean are
to be explained, or analyzed, in terms of facts about what speakers
mean by utterances of them, and (2) facts about what speakers mean by
their utterances can be explained in terms of their intentions. These
two theses comprise the &ldquo;Gricean program&rdquo; for reducing
meaning to the contents of the intentions of speakers.</p>

<p>
To understand Grice&rsquo;s view of meaning, it is important first to
be clear on the distinction between the meaning, or content, of
<em>linguistic expressions</em>&mdash;which is what semantic theories
like those discussed in
 <a href="#SemaTheo">&sect;2</a>
 aim to describe&mdash;and what <em>speakers</em> mean by utterances
employing those expressions. This distinction can be illustrated by
example. (See entry on
 <a href="../pragmatics/">pragmatics</a>
 for more discussion.) Suppose that in response to a question about
the weather in the city where I live, I say &ldquo;Well, South Bend is
not exactly Hawaii&rdquo;. The meaning of this sentence is fairly
clear: it expresses the (true) proposition that South Bend, Indiana is
not identical to Hawaii. But what <em>I</em> mean by uttering this
sentence is something more than this triviality: I mean by the
utterance that the weather in South Bend is not nearly as good as that
in Hawaii. And this example utterance is in an important respect very
typical: usually the propositions which speakers mean to convey by
their utterances include propositions other than the one expressed by
the sentence used in the context. When we ask &ldquo;What did you mean
by that?&rdquo; we are usually not asking for the meaning of the
sentence uttered.</p>

<p>
The idea behind stage (1) of Grice&rsquo;s theory of meaning is that
of these two phenomena, speaker-meaning is the more fundamental:
sentences and other expressions mean what they do because of what
speakers mean by their utterances of those sentences. (For more
details about how Grice thought that sentence-meaning could be
explained in terms of speaker-meaning, see the discussion of resultant
procedures in the entry on
 <a href="../grice/">Paul Grice</a>.)
 One powerful way to substantiate the claim that speaker-meaning is
explanatorily prior to expression-meaning would be to show that facts
about speaker-meaning may be given an analysis which makes no use of
facts about what expressions mean; and this is just what stage (2) of
Grice&rsquo;s analysis, to which we now turn, aims to provide.</p>

<p>
Grice thought that speaker-meaning could be analyzed in terms of the
communicative intentions of speakers&mdash;in particular, their
intentions to cause beliefs in their audience.</p>

<p>
The simplest version of this idea would hold that meaning <em>p</em>
by an utterance is just a matter of intending that one&rsquo;s
audience come to believe <em>p</em>. But this can&rsquo;t be quite
right. Suppose I turn to you and say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing on
my foot&rdquo;. I intend that you hear the words I am saying; so I
intend that you believe that I have said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing
on my foot&rdquo;. But I do not mean by my utterance that I have said,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing on my foot&rdquo;. That <em>is</em> my
utterance&mdash;what I mean by it is the proposition that you are
standing on my foot, or that you should get off of my foot. I do not
mean by my utterance that I am uttering a certain sentence.</p>

<p>
This sort of example indicates that speaker meaning can&rsquo;t just
be a matter of intending to cause a certain belief&mdash;it must be
intending to cause a certain belief in a certain way. But what, in
addition to intending to cause the belief, is required for meaning
that <em>p</em>? Grice&rsquo;s idea was that one must not only intend
to cause the audience to form a belief, but also intend that they do
so on the basis of their recognition of the speaker&rsquo;s intention.
This condition is not met in the above example: I don&rsquo;t expect
you to believe that I have uttered a certain sentence on the basis of
your recognition of my intention that you do so; after all,
you&rsquo;d believe this whether or not I wanted you to. This is all
to the good.</p>

<p>
This Gricean analysis of speaker-meaning can be formulated as follows
(Grice 1957 and 1969):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<li><span class="tag">[G]</span><span class="sen"> <em>a</em> means
<em>p</em> by uttering <em>x</em> iff <em>a</em> intends in uttering
<em>x</em> that</span></li>

<li><span class="sen">1.</span><span class="subsen"> his audience come
to believe <em>p</em>, </span></li>

<li><span class="sen">2. </span><span class="subsen"> his audience
recognize this intention, and </span></li>

<li><span class="sen">3. </span><span class="subsen"> (1) occur on the
basis of (2). </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
However, even if [G] can be given a fairly plausible motivation, and
fits many cases rather well, it is also open to some convincing
counterexamples. Three such types of cases are: (i) cases in which the
speaker means <em>p</em> by an utterance despite knowing that the
audience already believes <em>p</em>, as in cases of reminding or
confession; (ii) cases in which a speaker means <em>p</em> by an
utterance, such as the conclusion of an argument, which the speaker
intends an audience to believe on the basis of evidence rather than
recognition of speaker intention; and (iii) cases in which there is no
intended audience at all, as in uses of language in thought. These
cases call into question whether there is any connection between
speaker-meaning and intended effects stable enough to ground an
analysis of the sort that Grice envisaged; it is controversial whether
an explanation of speaker meaning descended from [G] can succeed.</p>

<p>
For developments of the Gricean program, see&mdash;in addition to the
classic essays in Grice (1989)&mdash;Schiffer (1972), Neale (1992),
and Davis (2002). For an extended criticism, see Schiffer (1987). A
different use of intentions in metasemantics uses the resources of
game theory; see for an example Parikh (2010).</p>

<h3 id="MentReprBaseTheo">3.3 Mental representation-based theories</h3>

<p>
The two sorts of mentalist theories sketched above both try to explain
meaning in terms of the relationship between linguistic expressions
and propositional attitudes of users of the relevant language. But
this is not the only sort of theory available to a theorist who wants
to explain meaning as inheritance of contents from mental
representations. A common view in the philosophy of mind and cognitive
science is that the propositional attitudes of subjects are
underwritten by an internal language of thought, comprised of mental
representations. (See entry on
 <a href="../computational-mind/">the computational theory of mind</a>.)
 One might try to explain linguistic meaning directly in terms of the
contents of mental representations, perhaps by thinking of language
processing as pairing linguistic expressions with mental
representations; one could then think of the meaning of the relevant
expression for that individual as being inherited from the content of
the mental representation with which it is paired.</p>

<p>
While this view has, historically, not enjoyed as much attention as
the mentalist theories discussed in the preceding two subsections, it
is a natural view for anyone who endorses the widely held thesis that
semantic competence is to be explained by some sort of internal
representation of the semantic facts. If we need to posit such
internal representations anyway, it is natural to think that the
meaning of an expression for an individual can be explained in terms
of that individual&rsquo;s representation of its meaning. For
discussion of this sort of theory, see Laurence (1996).</p>

<h3 id="CausOrig">3.4 Causal origin</h3>

<p>
In <em>Naming and Necessity</em>, Kripke suggested that the reference
of a name could be explained in terms of the history of use of that
name, rather than by descriptions associated with that name by its
users. In the standard case, Kripke thought, the right explanation of
the reference of a name could be divided into an explanation of the
name&rsquo;s <em>introduction</em> as name for this or that&mdash;an
event of &ldquo;baptism&rdquo;&mdash;and its successful
<em>transmission</em> from one speaker to another.</p>

<p>
One approach to the theory of meaning is to extend Kripke&rsquo;s
remarks in two ways: first, by suggesting that they might serve as an
account of meaning, as well as
 reference;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 and second, by extending them to parts of speech other than names.
(See, for discussion, Devitt 1981.) In this way, we might aim to
explain the meanings of expressions in terms of their causal
origin.</p>

<p>
While causal theories don&rsquo;t take expressions to simply inherit
their contents from mental states, it is plausible that they should
still give mental states an important role to play in explaining
meaning. For example, it is plausible that introducing a term involves
<em>intending</em> that it stand for some object or property, and that
transmission of a term from one speaker to another involves the latter
<em>intending</em> to use it in the same way as the former.</p>

<p>
There are two standard problems for causal theories of this sort
(whether they are elaborated in a mentalist or a non-mentalist way).
The first is the problem of extending the theory from the case of
names to to other sorts of vocabulary for which the theory seems less
natural. Examples which have seemed to many to be problematic are
empty names and non-referring theoretical terms, logical vocabulary,
and predicates which, because their content does not seem closely
related to the properties represented in perceptual experience, are
not intuitively linked to any initial act of &ldquo;baptism&rdquo;.
The second problem, which is sometimes called the &ldquo;<em>qua</em>
problem&rdquo;, is the problem of explaining which of the many causes
of a term&rsquo;s introduction should determine its content. Suppose
that the term &ldquo;water&rdquo; was introduced in the presence of a
body of H<sub>2</sub>O. What made it a term for this substance, rather
than for liquid in general, or colorless liquid, or colorless liquid
in the region of the term&rsquo;s introduction? The proponent of a
causal theory owes some answer to this question; see for discussion
Devitt and Sterelny (1987).</p>

<p>
For a classic discussion of the prospects of causal theories, see
Evans (1973). For a more recent theory which makes causal origin part
but not all of the story, see Dickie (2015).</p>

<h3 id="TrutMaxiPrinChar">3.5 Truth-maximization and the principle of charity</h3>

<p>
Causal theories aim to explain meaning in terms of the relations
between expressions and the objects and properties they represent. A
very different sort of metasemantics which maintains this emphasis on
the relations between expressions and the world gives a central role
to a <em>principle of charity</em> which holds that (modulo some
qualifications) the right assignment of meanings to the expression of
a subject&rsquo;s language is that assignment of meanings which
maximizes the truth of the subject&rsquo;s utterances.</p>

<p>
An influential proponent of this sort of view was Donald Davidson, who
stated the motivation for the view as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A central source of trouble is the way beliefs and meanings conspire
to account for utterances. A speaker who holds a sentence to be true
on an occasion does so in part because of what he means, or would
mean, by an utterance of that sentence, and in part because of what he
believes. If all we have to go on is the fact of honest utterance, we
cannot infer the belief without knowing the meaning, and have no
chance of inferring the meaning without the belief. (Davidson 1974a:
314; see also Davidson 1973)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s idea was that attempts to state the facts in virtue
of which expressions have a certain meaning for a subject face a kind
of dilemma: if we had an independent account of what it is for an
agent to have a belief with a certain content, we could ascend from
there to an account of what it is for a sentence to have a meaning; if
we had an independent account of what it is for a sentence to have a
meaning, we could ascend from there to an account of what it is for an
agent to have a belief with a certain content; but in fact neither
sort of independent account is available, because many assignments of
beliefs and meanings are consistent with the subject&rsquo;s
linguistic behavior. Davidson&rsquo;s solution to this dilemma is that
we must define belief and meaning together, in terms of an independent
third fact: the fact that the beliefs of an agent, and the meanings of
her words, are whatever they must be in order to maximize the truth of
her beliefs and utterances.</p>

<p>
On its face, this sort of metasemantic theory would seem to provide a
more complete account of the representational facts than the other
approaches we have discussed. It promises to give an account together
of meaning and belief, rather than taking the latter for granted in
explaining the former.</p>

<p>
By tying meaning and belief to truth, this sort of metasemantic theory
implies that it is impossible for anyone who speaks a meaningful
language to be radically mistaken about the nature of the world; and
this implies that certain levels of radical disagreement between a
pair of speakers or communities will also be impossible (since the
beliefs of each community must be, by and large, true). This is a
consequence of the view which Davidson embraced (see Davidson 1974b);
but one might also reasonably think that radical disagreement, as well
as radical error, are possible, and hence that any theory, like
Davidson&rsquo;s, which implies that they are impossible must be
mistaken.</p>

<p>
A different sort of worry about a theory of this sort is that the
requirement that we maximize the truth of the utterances of subjects
hardly seems sufficient to determine the meanings of the expressions
of their language. It seems plausible, offhand, that there will be
many different interpretations of a subject&rsquo;s language which
will be tied on the measure of truth-maximization; one way to see the
force of this sort of worry is to recall the point, familiar from our
discussion of possible worlds semantics in
 <a href="#PossWorlSema">&sect;2.1.5</a>
 above, that a pair of sentences can be true in exactly the same
circumstances and yet differ in meaning. One worry is thus that a
theory of Davidson&rsquo;s sort will entail an implausible
indeterminacy of meaning. For Davidson&rsquo;s fullest attempt to
answer this sort of worry, see Chapter 3 of Davidson (2005).</p>

<h3 id="RefeMagn">3.6 Reference magnetism</h3>

<p>
A different sort of theory emerges from a further objection to the
sort of theory discussed in the previous section. This objection is
based on Hilary Putnam&rsquo;s (1980, 1981) model-theoretic argument.
This argument aimed to show that there are very many different
assignments of reference to subsentential expressions of our language
which make all of our utterances true. (For details on how the
argument works, see the entry on
 <a href="../paradox-skolem/">Skolem&rsquo;s paradox</a>,
 especially &sect;3.4.) Putnam&rsquo;s argument therefore leaves us
with a choice between two options: either we must accept that there
are no facts of the matter about what any of our expressions refer to,
or we must deny that reference assignments are determined solely by a
principle of truth-maximization.</p>

<p>
Most philosophers take the second option. Doing so, however,
doesn&rsquo;t mean that something like the principle of charity
can&rsquo;t still be part of our metasemantics.</p>

<p>
David Lewis (1983, 1984) gave a version of this kind of response,
which he credits to Merrill (1980), and which has since been quite
influential. His idea was that the assignment of contents to
expressions of our language is fixed, not just by the constraint that
the right interpretation will maximize the truth of our utterances,
but by picking the interpretation which does best at jointly
satisfying the constraints of truth-maximization and the constraint
that the referents of our terms should, as much as possible, be
&ldquo;the ones that respect the objective joints in nature&rdquo;
(1984: 227).</p>

<p>
Such entities are often said to be more &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; to be
the referents of expressions than others. An approach to the
foundations of meaning based on the twin principles of charity +
eligibility has some claim to being the most widely held view today.
See Sider (2011) for an influential extension of the Lewisian
strategy.</p>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; solution to Putnam&rsquo;s problem comes with a
non-trivial metaphysical price tag: recognition of an objective graded
distinction between more and less natural properties. Some have found
the price too much to pay, and have sought other approaches to
metasemantics. But even if we recognize in our metaphysics a
distinction between properties which are &ldquo;joint-carving&rdquo;
and those which are not, we might still doubt whether this distinction
can remedy the sorts of indeterminacy problems which plague
metasemantic theories which are based solely on the principle of
charity. For doubts along these lines, see Hawthorne (2007).</p>

<h3 id="RuleUse">3.7 Rules of use</h3>

<p>
A last way to develop a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning
focuses less on relations between subsentential expressions or
sentences and bits of non-linguistic reality and more on the rules
which govern our use of language. This view is often associated with
the work of the later Wittgenstein and his philosophical descendants.
(See especially Wittgenstein 1953.)</p>

<p>
One question facing theories of this sort is whether the rules are
thought of as normative or as descriptive. According to the first
view, the relevant rules are facts about how we ought to use certain
expressions. According to the second, they are facts about how we do
in fact use those expressions. Brandom (1994) develops a use theory of
the first sort; Horwich (1998, 2005) develops a use theory of the
second sort.</p>

<p>
On Brandom&rsquo;s view, a sentence&rsquo;s meaning is due to the
conditions, in a given society, under which it is correct or
appropriate to perform various speech acts involving the sentence. To
develop a theory of this sort, one must do two things. First, one must
show how the meanings of expressions can be explained in terms of
these normative statuses. Second, one must explain how these normative
statuses come to be. For discussion of the role (or lack thereof) of
normativity in a foundational theory of meaning, see Hattiangadi
(2007), Gluer and Wilkforss (2009), and the entry on
 <a href="../meaning-normativity/">meaning normativity</a>.</p>
 
<p>
On Horwich&rsquo;s view, our acceptance of sentences is governed by
certain laws, and, in the case of non-ambiguous expressions, there is
a single &ldquo;acceptance regularity&rdquo; which explains all of our
uses of the expression. This is a descriptive fact about our use
language. The meanings of expressions are determined by the acceptance
regularity which governs their use.</p>

<p>
A second question facing theories of this sort is whether the relevant
rules are thought of as governing an individual&rsquo;s use of
language or as governing the use of a linguistic community. Horwich
opts for the individualistic version, whereas Brandom goes for the
community-first version. But this choice point is orthogonal to the
first; one could also go for a descriptive community-first theory or a
normative individualistic one.</p>

<p>
It is open to proponents of any of these theories to say that
different sorts of rules are operative for different types of
linguistic expressions. Horwich opts for a view of this kind. The type
of acceptance regularity which is relevant will vary depending on the
sort of expression whose meaning is being explained. For example, our
use of a perceptual term like &ldquo;red&rdquo; might be best
explained by the following acceptance regularity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The disposition to accept &ldquo;that is red&rdquo; in response to the
sort of visual experience normally provoked by a red surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, in the case of a logical term like
&ldquo;and&rdquo;, the acceptance regularity will involve dispositions
to accept inferences involving pairs of sentences rather than
dispositions to respond to particular sorts of experiences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The disposition to accept the two-way argument schema &ldquo;_p_, _q_
// _p_ and _q_&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is plausible that the flexibility of this sort of &ldquo;rules of use&rdquo;
approach is one of its strengths.</p>

<p>
One might also adopt a theory which combines a use theory with aspects
of a mentalist theory. For example, Pautz (2021) proposes a theory
which explains linguistic meaning in terms of facts about perceptual
representation along with facts about use.</p>
