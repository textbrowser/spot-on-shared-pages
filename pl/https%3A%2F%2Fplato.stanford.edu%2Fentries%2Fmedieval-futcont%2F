<h1>Medieval Theories of Future Contingents</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jun 15, 2006; substantive revision Wed Apr 9, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The philosophical debate concerning the truth-value of singular
statements about future contingents derives from Chapter 9 of
Aristotle&rsquo;s treatise <em>De interpretatione</em> (<em>Peri
hermeneias</em>). In Chapters 7&ndash;8, Aristotle deals with the
contradictory pairs of assertoric statements which divide truth and
falsity so that one is true and the other is false. In Chapter 9 he
raises the question of whether this holds for all assertoric
statements or whether there might be an exception concerning
statements about singular future events or states of affairs which are
neither necessary nor impossible and hence may take place, or may not.
Aristotle&rsquo;s famous example is tomorrow&rsquo;s sea battle. Is
the prediction that there will be a sea battle tomorrow necessarily
true, if it is true, and does its truth entail that the sea battle is
inevitable? After a discussion of deterministic arguments and the
absurdity of fatalism (18a34&ndash;19a22), Aristotle gives his
ambiguous reply in 19a23&ndash;39. Boethius&rsquo;s (c. 480&ndash;524)
Latin translation of <em>De interpretatione</em> gave rise to a long
commentary tradition through the Middle Ages, beginning from the 11th
century. Boethius&rsquo;s own two commentaries were very influential
as well and provided information about other ancient commentaries
(Magee 2010). Chapter 9 was also dealt with in theological
commentaries on Peter Lombard&rsquo;s <em>Sentences</em> in the
context of discussing God&rsquo;s knowledge of contingents (I.38) and
in separate questions (Isaac 1953; Lohr 1967&ndash;1974; Craig 1988;
Marenbon 2000; Braakhuis &amp; Kneepkens 2003a; Knuuttila 2010).
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s (c. 870&ndash;950) commentary on
<em>De interpretatione</em> was influential in medieval Arabic
philosophy; Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126&ndash;1198) wrote another
Arabic commentary. (For future contingents in medieval Arabic thought,
see Marmura 1985; Adamson 2006; Kaukua 2024.)</p>

<h2 id="AriBoe">1. From Aristotle to Boethius</h2>

<h3 id="AriFutConComIntAntConSch">1.1 Aristotle on Future Contingents: Competing Interpretations in Antiquity and Contemporary Scholarship</h3>

<p>
The discussion about future contingents in modern philosophical logic
was revived by J. &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s works on three-valued logic
(1957, 1967). He thought that in order to avoid fatalistic
consequences, one should admit that the principle of bivalence (for
any proposition <em>p</em>, either <em>p</em> is true or <em>p</em> is
false) does not hold good for future contingent propositions. Arguing
that this was realized by Aristotle in Chapter 9 of <em>De
interpretatione</em>, &#321;ukasiewicz attempted to formalize
Aristotle&rsquo;s position by introducing a third truth-value (neither
true nor false) for future contingent propositions and giving
three-valued truth-tables for truth-functional basic connectives. Many
authors have followed &#321;ukasiewicz in taking Aristotle to restrict
the principle of bivalence, though they have not ascribed to Aristotle
the details of &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s system, which is problematic
in many respects. In arguing for the deterministic consequences of
unrestricted bivalence, &#321;ukasiewicz himself assumed, and took
Aristotle to assume, that the truth of a proposition entails the
necessity of its truth. Logical determinism, therefore, is to be
avoided by qualifying the truth-values of future contingent
propositions. The critics of this view do not see any entailment
relation between truth and necessity, some of them maintaining that
the illusion of logical determinism has its roots in a tacit
oscillation between a temporal and atemporal predication of truth. The
temporalized reading may be associated with diachronic determination,
certainty, necessity and other time-dependent qualifications. Mixing
these with non-deterministic atemporal predications yields the wrong
idea of fatalism (von Wright 1984: 52&ndash;67). It is argued that
even the temporalized predication of truth carries no deterministic
implications. (Sorabji 1980: 96&ndash;103; Sorabji&rsquo;s example is
that &ldquo;even if it has already been true that I am going to swim,
I still retain the power to make it to have been false&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>
The majority of Aristotelian scholars believe that the argument in
<em>De interpretatione</em> 9 aims at avoiding fatalism by restricting
bivalence for future contingent predictions (Frede 1970, 1985; Sorabji
1980; Craig 1988; Gaskin 1995; Crivelli 2004; Weidemann 2012). The
second interpretation insists that Aristotle&rsquo;s point is not to
deny the truth-value of these statements, but their being true in the
same way as other statements are true. The difference is that while
the truth of other statements is necessary, the truth of future
contingent predictions is not yet similarly determined. This
interpretation is associated with Aristotle&rsquo;s remark that not
everything which is actual and therefore necessary is necessary
without qualification (19a23). This is taken to mean that the
necessity of an event at a certain time does not imply that it was
inevitable. Aristotle speaks about singular future possibilities which
may be realized or remain unrealized and which may or may not cease to
be antecedent possibilities (see <em>De interpretatione</em>
19a13&ndash;17, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> III.5, 1114a17&ndash;19,
<em>Metaphysics</em> VI.3). In the same way predictions may begin to
be necessarily true or necessarily false. (For various versions of
this approach, see Anscombe 1956; Rescher 1963; Hintikka 1973; Fine
1984; Judson 1988.)</p>

<p>
The former interpretation, which denies bivalence for future
contingent statements, is called the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; or
&lsquo;standard&rsquo; interpretation. Some Stoics read Aristotle in
this way, as Boethius reports in his second commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De interpretatione</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Now some people &ndash; the Stoics among them &ndash; thought that
Aristotle says that future contingents are neither true nor false. For
they interpreted his saying that nothing [of that sort] is disposed
more to being than to not being as meaning that it makes no difference
whether they are thought false or true; for they considered them to be
neither true nor false [in Aristotle&rsquo;s view], but falsely.
(<em>In Perihermeneias</em> II, 208.1&ndash;4, trans. by N.
Kretzmann.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the basis of a note in Simplicius&rsquo;s commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> (407.6&ndash;13), it is argued
that some Aristotelians also qualified the principle of bivalence.
(For this and other ancient deviations from the principle, see Sorabji
1980: 92&ndash;93.) On the other hand, future contingent propositions
were treated as true or false in Stoic logic. Some hold that the
Stoics took the universally valid principle of bivalence to imply the
predetermination of all future events. (See Cicero, <em>De fato</em>,
20&ndash;21; Bobzien 1998: 59&ndash;86.) (For an argument that the
Stoics avoided determinism despite their application of bivalence to
future contingent propositions, see de Harven 2016.)</p>

<p>
Boethius regarded the Stoic interpretation of Aristotle&rsquo;s view
as mistaken, his interpretation being based on the terms
&lsquo;definitely&rsquo; true or false and &lsquo;indefinitely&rsquo;
true or false. These same terms were also used in Ammonius&rsquo;s
commentary (c. 435/445&ndash;517/526). Since this work was not known
to Boethius, both authors seem to have known some earlier Greek
discussions in which these qualifications were introduced.
(Ammonius&rsquo;s Greek commentary on <em>De interpretatione</em> 9 is
translated by D. Blank and Boethius&rsquo;s Latin commentaries by N.
Kretzmann in the same volume, with interpretative essays by R.
Sorabji, N. Kretzmann and M. Mignucci in 1998.)</p>

<h3 id="BoeFutConGodKnoCon">1.2 Boethius on Future Contingents and God&rsquo;s Knowledge of Contingents</h3>

<p>
The contemporary reconstructions of what Ammonius and Boethius meant
can be divided into two groups. According to one interpretation,
Ammonius and Boethius ascribe to Aristotle the view that the
predictions of future contingent events and their denials differ from
other contradictory pairs, because truth and falsity are not
definitely distributed between them and the propositions are
consequently neither definitely true nor definitely false. In
answering the Stoic criticism, Boethius might have thought that future
contingent propositions have the disjunctive property of being
true-or-false, which would mean something other than simply lacking a
truth value. (For various interpretations of how Boethius restricted
bivalence, see Frede 1985; Craig 1988; Gaskin 1995; Kretzmann 1998.)
Another interpretation holds that Boethian future contingents are not
definitely true or false because their truth-makers are not yet
determined, but are true or false in an indeterminate way. No
qualification of the principle of bivalence is involved. True
statements are either definitely true or simply (indefinitely) true or
false (Mignucci 1988, 1998; 2020; Seel 2000; Beets 2003 for
Boethius&rsquo;s first commentary). According to both interpretations,
Ammonius and Boethius assumed that the definite truth of predictions
directly implies determinism and that Aristotle denied the definite
truth of all future contingent propositions; it is less clear how they
understood the indefinite truth of these (Sorabji 1998a).
Boethius&rsquo;s formulations often suggest that future contingent
propositions are true-or-false. An additional reason for not treating
them as simply true or false is his view of the necessity of the
present. In commenting on Aristotle&rsquo;s remark that &ldquo; what
is necessarily is when it is&rdquo; (<em>De interpretatione</em>
19a23), Boethius explains that even though present things are
temporally or conditionally necessary, they may be generically or
antecedently contingent (<em>In Perihermeneias</em> I,
121.20&ndash;122.4; II, 241.7&ndash;243.28). He apparently thinks that
the truth of future contingent statements implies that things cannot
be otherwise, for the assumed actuality of the relevant future
truth-makers means that alternative diachronic prospectives are
rendered temporally impossible.</p>

<p>
In his longer commentary on <em>De interpretatione</em>, Boethius says
of God that &ldquo;he knows future events as happening contingently
and not necessarily so that he does not ignore the possibility that
something else might take place&rdquo; (<em>In Perihermeneias</em> II,
226.9&ndash;12). Boethius also stresses that since the truth of future
contingents is not accessible to humans, predictions of the form
&ldquo;A sea battle will take place tomorrow&rdquo; are false in the
sense that they assert the truth of something that cannot be known
(<em>In Perihermeneias</em> II, 211.26&ndash;213.18). In his later
treatise <em>Consolatio philosophiae</em> Boethius states that
&ldquo;I do not think that anybody would say that those things which
are happening now were not going to happen before they happened&rdquo;
(V. 4.19) In this treatise, Boethius argues that God is atemporal and
has the totality of changing history present to him. God&rsquo;s
knowledge is thus not foreknowledge since it is not temporally
located, but the predictions of future contingents are true or false
from the point of view of God&rsquo;s eternal knowledge of the things
referred to (V.6, 25&ndash;32; see also Augustine, <em>City of
God</em> 11.21). According to Boethius, it is necessary that if God
knows that <em>p</em>, then <em>p</em>. This &lsquo;conditional
necessity&rsquo; does not imply the &lsquo;simple necessity&rsquo; of
<em>p</em> (<em>Consolatio philosophiae</em> V, 6.27&ndash;30). Some
medieval authors read this distinction in Boethius and Augustine as a
modal placement solution to the problem of foreknowledge and free will
(Matthews 2004). Thomas Aquinas (1224/5&ndash;1274), for example,
refers to Boethius&rsquo;s distinction using the terms <em>necessitas
consequentiae</em> and <em>necessitas consequentis</em> (<em>Summa
contra gentiles</em> I.67; <em>De veritate</em> I.23, ad 13). For
Boethius, see Evans 2004; Marenbon 2005; Sharples 2009; Marenbon
2013.</p>

<p>
Boethius&rsquo;s remarks on modalities have led some authors to
analyze them by using models derived from modern temporal or tense
logic with branching time theory developed by Prior, Burgess, Thomason
and others. In applying these to Boethius, Bornholdt states that the
models shed light on Boethius&rsquo;s approach even though they were
not intended by Boethius himself (2017: 49; see also Martin 2004:
53&ndash;63). Bornholdt extends his formal analysis to later medieval
discussions as well, calling it the Boethian model. For similar
non-historical reconstructions of time logic in some late medieval
theories of future contingents, see the entry on
 <a href="../future-contingents/">future contingents</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="MedIntAri">2. Medieval Interpretations of Aristotle</h2>

<h3 id="PetAbeAno12tCenCom">2.1 Peter Abelard and an anonymous 12th century commentator</h3>

<p>
In light of the influence of Aristotle&rsquo;s works in the Middle
Ages, figures throughout the period offered interpretations of
Aristotle&rsquo;s views on the truth-value of future contingent
propositions. Like with present day scholars, there were varying views
about how to read Aristotle&rsquo;s position. Mignucci&rsquo;s account
of how Ammonius and Boethius understood the distinction between
definite and indefinite truth is roughly speaking the same as the
explanation of these terms in Peter Abelard&rsquo;s (1079&ndash;1142)
interpretation of <em>De interpretatione</em> 9. Abelard believed that
Aristotle assumed that future contingent statements are true or false,
though not determinately true or false before the actuality of the
things to which they refer (<em>Dialectica</em> 213.17&ndash;20).
Abelard used the notions of &lsquo;determinate/indeterminate&rsquo;
instead of the Boethian &lsquo;definite/indefinite&rsquo;, as most
medieval authors did. In this interpretation, he retained the
principle of bivalence for all assertoric statements, but rejected the
universal application of the stronger principle that every assertoric
statement is determinately true or determinately false. According to
Abelard, the notions of &lsquo;determinate&rsquo; or
&lsquo;indeterminate&rsquo; apply primarily to the truth-makers of
assertions and secondarily to assertions themselves:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But as the obtaining of future contingent states of affairs is
indeterminate, similarly the propositions which enunciate these are
said to be indeterminately true or false, for those which are true are
indeterminately true and those which are false are indeterminately
false, in acccordance with the indeterminate obtaining of what is
predicted. <em>Dialectica</em> 211.30&ndash;32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Abelard was interested in the question of whether the present truth of
statements about future contingent events are themselves determinate;
i. e., whether &ldquo;The sentence &lsquo;Socrates will eat
tomorrow&rsquo; is true&rdquo;, if true, is determinately true.
Denying this, he restricted the principle that all past and present
true propositions are determinately true. Abelard also distinguished
between determinateness and certainty. Future contingent propositions
may be certain if they are revealed by angels, for example, but they
are not knowable of themselves and not determinately true. (See
<em>Glossae super Peri hermeneias</em> IX.19&ndash;42;
<em>Dialectica</em> 211.32&ndash;212.23; Lewis 1987; Binini 2020,
2022: 276&ndash;294.)</p>

<p>
The &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; view of truth and bivalence in Aristotle
is put forward in an anonymous early 12th-century commentary on <em>De
interpretatione</em>, edited by M. Dal Pra, which is often, and
probably mistakenly, attributed to Abelard. Applying Boethius&rsquo;s
distinction between definitely and indefinitely true statements, the
author argues that future contingent statements are merely
disjunctively true or false (<em>tantum sub disjunctione</em>);
100.13&ndash;19; 112.8&ndash;113.3). They are true-or-false.</p>

<h3 id="N1314tCenCom">2.2 13th and 14th century commentators</h3>

<p>
While Abelard thought that the universal validity of the principle of
bivalence was an Aristotelian view, 13th-century commentators argued
for the traditional interpretation. Albert the Great (1206&ndash;1280)
and Thomas Aquinas took Aristotle to be arguing in <em>De
interpretatione</em> 9 that if every contradictory pair divides truth
and falsity in a determinate way and the members are consequently
determinately true or false, all things must determinately be or not
be. They thought that Aristotle then refuted the consequent by
referring to various contingent things. It follows that the antecedent
cannot be true and future contingent propositions are not
determinately true or determinately false. They are true-or-false
under disjunction (Albert the Great, <em>Liber Perihermeneias</em>,
I.5.4&ndash;6, 418&ndash;422; Thomas Aquinas, <em>In libros
Perihermeneias</em>, I.13, 170&ndash;172; I.15, 202&ndash;203). The
same interpretation of Aristotle is found in Arabic commentators
Ab&#363; Nasr al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; and Averroes. (See
<em>Al-Farabi&rsquo;s</em> <em>Commentary and Short Treatise on
Aristotle&rsquo;s</em> De interpretatione, trans. F. Zimmermann,
lxviii, 75&ndash;76, 78&ndash;79, 91&ndash;92, 244&ndash;245, and
Averroes&rsquo;s <em>Middle Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s</em> De
interpretatione, 82va.) Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s own view was
that future contingents are either true or false (94&ndash;96; Marmura
1985; Adamson 2006).</p>

<p>
The traditional interpretation of Aristotle&rsquo;s view was put
forward by many late 13th and 14th century Latin commentators such as
John Duns Scotus (1265/6&ndash;1308), <em>Quaestiones in libros
Perihermenias Aristotelis</em>, I.7&ndash;8 (179&ndash;181), trans.
Buckner and Zupko; Walter Burley (ca. 1275&ndash;1344),
<em>Commentarius in librum Perihermeneias Aristotelis</em>, 92,
95&ndash;96; Peter Auriol (ca. 1280&ndash;1322), <em>Scriptum in I
Sententiarum</em> I.38.3, 817&ndash;828; William Ockham (ca.
1287&ndash;1347), <em>Expositio in Librum Perihermenias
Aristotelis</em> I.6.15; Gregory of Rimini (ca. 1300&ndash;1358),
<em>Lectura super I Sententiarum</em> I.38.1.1 (238&ndash;243); Peter
of Ailly (1351&ndash;1420), <em>Quaestiones super libros
Sententiarum</em> I.11.1A). In his <em>Supercommentary on
Averroes&rsquo;s Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s</em> De
interpretatione, the Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson (Gersonides,
1288&ndash;1344) states that positing a truth value for future
contingents leads to absurdity (83r; Rudavsky 1985: 166). However,
John Buridan (ca. 1300&ndash;1361) read Aristotle in the same way as
Abelard. All assertoric statements are true or false though those
about future contingents are not determinately true or false
(<em>Questiones longe super librum Perihermeneias</em> I.10).</p>

<p>
Since theologians usually thought that divine omniscience and prophecy
presupposed unrestricted bivalence, the discussion of future
contingents was divided into historical constructions of
Aristotle&rsquo;s view, mostly in accordance with the traditional
interpretation, and the systematic discussions in theology that mostly
refuted this for doctrinal reasons. Later examples of the traditional
interpretation of Aristotle&rsquo;s view include George of Brussels
(d. 1510), <em>Logica magistri Georgii inserto textu Bricoti</em>,
51rv; Iodocus Trutfetter (1460&ndash;1519), <em>Summulae totius
logicae</em> II.1 (LL3v&ndash;4v); <em>Veteris

<h2 id="MedDev100">3. Medieval Developments from 1000&ndash;1200</h2>

<h3 id="DisBetTypModModSta">3.1 Distinctions Between Types of Modalities and Modal Statements</h3>

<p>
In discussing statements such as &ldquo;What is known by God
necessarily takes place&rdquo;, Anselm of Canterbury (1033&ndash;1109)
distinguished between the antecedent and consequent necessity of
things which are known. The latter is the necessity of a thing&rsquo;s
actuality which is caused by the actuality of the thing itself. The
former is the necessity by which a thing exists because of an external
cause (<em>Cur Deus homo</em> 2.17, 125.6&ndash;126.2). Neither
antecedent knowledge nor antecedent truth has a compelling effect on
things. In explaining Mary&rsquo;s believing the truth of a prophetic
statement concerning the death of Christ, Anselm writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, since her faith was true faith, it was necessary that
things would be as she believed. But if you are once again disturbed
by my saying &ldquo;It was necessary&hellip;&rdquo;, remember that the
truth of the virgin&rsquo;s faith was not the cause of his dying
freely but that her faith was true faith because this was going to
happen. (<em>Cur Deus homo</em> 2.17, 124.27&ndash;125.3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Anselm thought that future contingent statements based on divine
revelation were true without deterministic implications. A similar
view was held by most medieval theologians when they addressed divine
omniscience and prophesy. For Anselm&rsquo;s view, see Knuuttila
2004.</p>

<p>
William of Champeaux (c. 1070&ndash;1122) dealt with an argument
against the compatibility between contingency and divine omniscience
which was discussed in Augustine&rsquo;s <em>City of God</em> (V.9).
In response to Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De fato</em> and <em>De
divinatione</em>, Augustine refuted the claim that if events can
happen in any way other than God has foreseen, then God can be in
error. William stated that the antecedent of the argument is true but
the consequent is false and therefore the consequence is not valid
(Lottin 1959: 195; Marenbon 1997: 226&ndash;227). Peter Abelard, in
discussing the same example, applied the systematic division between
modal statements <em>de sensu</em> or in the compounded sense and
modal statements <em>de re</em> or in the divided sense. (For
Abelard&rsquo;s modal terminology, see <em>Glossae super Peri
hermeneias</em> XII.3&ndash;46. Later authors used the expression
<em>de dicto</em> instead of <em>de sensu.</em>) Abelard&rsquo;s
analysis of Cicero&rsquo;s argument was often repeated in medieval
theology, since it was put forward in slightly modified form in Peter
Lombard&rsquo;s <em>Sententiae</em> (c. 1157), which became the
standard medieval introduction to theology. Abelard states that when
the proposition &ldquo;A thing can be otherwise than God knows it to
be&rdquo; is read as a modal proposition <em>de sensu</em> (It is
possible that a thing is otherwise than God knows it to be), the
antecedent is false and the possibility of God&rsquo;s error as a
consequent would not be justified even if the consequence were valid.
When the antecedent is read <em>de re</em> (A thing that is now
somehow could be otherwise than God knows it to be), the proposition
is true, but the consequent about God&rsquo;s error is false, for if
things were otherwise, God would know them as they would be. This
shows that the consequence is not well formulated. Following Abelard,
Peter Lombard formulated the same view in stating that &ldquo;Things
cannot be other than as God foreknows them&rdquo; is true in the
compounded sense and false in the divided sense. The truth of the
compounded sense saves God&rsquo;s infallibility and the falsity of
the divided sense expresses God&rsquo;s freedom and the metaphysical
contingency of the future (Peter Lombard, <em>Sententiae</em> I.38.2;
Peter Abelard, <em>Glossae super Peri hermeneias</em> IX.86&ndash;99;
<em>Dialectica</em>, 217.27&ndash;219.24). It is assumed here that
when a temporally definite statement is true, its denial may be
possibly true.</p>

<h3 id="DisBetProTheCon">3.2 The Distinction Between Propositions and Their Content</h3>

<p>
Early medieval logicians could deal with singular future statements as
statement types with truth-values changing in accordance with the time
of assertion, as in Aristotle and Hellenistic philosophy. (For the
prevalence of temporally indefinite sentences in ancient philosophy,
see Hintikka 1973: Ch. 4; Bobzien 1998: 66&ndash;67, 100&ndash;101,
109&ndash;111.) In the theological context of timeless divine
omniscience, it was more natural to regard these statements as
temporally definite. Abelard calls statements propositions
(<em>propositio</em>) and what is asserted by a statement its
<em>dictum.</em> He considered that a statement is true or false when
its <em>dictum</em> is true or false. In dealing with prophesy,
Abelard suggested that the <em>dictum</em> about a singular event is
first expressed by a future tense proposition and then by present and
past tense propositions. (For the nature of the <em>dictum</em>,
contrasted with the &lsquo;facts&rsquo; and &lsquo;propositions&rsquo;
of twentieth-century philosophical jargon, see Marenbon 1997:
202&ndash;209).</p>

<p>
The view of a fixed propositional content was developed further by
12th-century authors who were later called <em>nominales.</em> One of
the theses of this group was &ldquo;What is once true is always
true&rdquo;. (See Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 196, 199&ndash;201,
205&ndash;206 for the relevant texts. For the history of the
principle, see also Marenbon 1992: 58&ndash;61 and Ebbesen 1992:
73&ndash;74.) This thesis was employed in the discussions of how the
beliefs of Abraham and others who lived before the coming of Christ
and believed various things about him were the same as the beliefs of
those who live after His coming. The reason for asking this was that
the previous beliefs were formulated in future tense statements and
the latter in present or past tense statements. According to the
<em>nominales</em>, one could regard as basic a temporally definite
propositional content the meaning of which is expressed by various
tensed expressions depending on when they are uttered. While tensed
statements about temporally definite singular events have a changing
truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed <em>dicta</em> are
unchangingly true or false (Nuchelmans 1973: 177&ndash;189; for some
later examples, see also Nuchelmans 1980; Lewis 1995; Goris 2001).
Peter of Poitiers (c. 1130&ndash;1205), one of the authors taking this
approach, argued that while the singular statements about contingent
things are immutably true or false because of God&rsquo;s eternal
choice, their unchanging truth-value could be otherwise. God does not
know contingent things through tensed statements, since their
truth-value is changeable. If God&rsquo;s knowledge is described by
using tensed statements, analogously to the articles of faith before
and after the coming of Christ, one should read them so that they
signify the same (Peter of Poitiers, <em>Sententiae</em> I.7,
133&ndash;143; I.12.199&ndash;223; I.14.328&ndash;253). This became a
well-known position since it was also employed in Peter
Lombard&rsquo;s <em>Sententiae</em> (I.39.1; I.41.3).</p>

<h3 id="RejNecPre">3.3 Rejection of the Necessity of the Present</h3>

<p>
The theological formulations by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard and Peter
of Poitiers discussed above exemplify 12th-century deviations from the
Aristotelian thesis &ldquo;What is necessarily is when it is&rdquo;.
This was traditionally understood as implying the principle of the
necessity of the present, which was not questioned in ancient modal
theories (Knuuttila 1993: Ch. 1). Since God&rsquo;s knowledge about
contingent things was regarded as unchangeable, the contingency of
this knowledge (in the sense that it could be different) also implied
the denial of the Aristotelian equation of immutability with
necessity, a denial regarded as an explicit doctrine of the
<em>nominales</em> (Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 194). The new modal
paradigm, which is more or less consciously applied in these
discussions of God&rsquo;s will, power, and knowledge, could be
characterized as the model of simultaneous or synchronic alternatives.
There are three main examples of it in early medieval philosophy.</p>

<p>
Abelard assumes that at a given instant of time, what is actual is
necessary as no longer avoidable, but he argues that unrealized
alternatives are possible at the same time in the sense that they
could have happened at that time. Some of the alternatives of a
singular being are real counterfactual alternatives. These are
unrealizable because of some previous change in the conditions of the
subject, and some are merely imaginable alternatives, such as
Socrates&rsquo;s being a bishop, which never had a real basis in
things. While often employing traditional ideas about necessity and
possibility, Abelard also developed ideas pertaining to simultaneous
alternatives. (See Martin 2003; Knuuttila 2008: 537&ndash;538; Binini
2022: 255&ndash;261.)</p>

<p>
Gilbert of Poitiers (1085/90&ndash;1154) stressed the idea that
natural regularities which are called natural necessities are not
absolute, since they are chosen by God and can be overridden by divine
power. This had become a widespread theological view in
Gilbert&rsquo;s time. Gilbert explained it in the light of the
Augustinian view of God&rsquo;s acting by choice between alternative
providential options and omnipotence as an executive power. There is
an interesting formulation of Plato&rsquo;s &lsquo;Platonitas&rsquo;
in Gilbert. This is said to include all of what Plato was, is and will
be as well as what he could be but never is. Even though Gilbert does
not explain why there is a modal element in the individual concept, it
was probably needed in order to speak about Plato in alternative
possible histories or, as in Abelard, about Socrates as a bishop.
Gilbert seems to have been the first to formulate an individual
concept in this way (Knuuttila 1993, 75&ndash;82; Marenbon 2007:
158&ndash;159).</p>

<p>
A third context of the systematic interest in simultaneous
alternatives was the new 12th-century theory that declarative singular
statements or their contents should be primarily treated as temporally
definite and as having an unchanging truth-value. All propositional
contents pertaining to contingent things have a truth-value on the
basis of God&rsquo;s eternal choice. These truth-values would be
otherwise if the providential design of the world were different in
relevant respects. Robert Grosseteste (1168/75&ndash;1253) taught that
the opposites of actualized contingent things are no longer realizable
possibilities, though they are possible alternatives in the sense that
they could have been included in God&rsquo;s eternal providential
choice. Actual history is an explication of one of the divine
alternatives with respect to which things are primarily called
necessary, possible or impossible. Necessities and possibilities at
this basic level are called modalities &lsquo;from eternity and
without beginning&rsquo;. Mathematical truths exemplify these
&lsquo;simple&rsquo; necessities. In addition, there are necessities
and impossibilities which have a beginning and which are eternal
contingencies in the sense that they depend on God&rsquo;s free choice
(<em>De libero arbitrio</em> 168.26&ndash;170.33; 178.28&ndash;29).
The contingency of the divine acts of knowledge and will is associated
with an atemporal causal priority between the powers and their acts
(178.24&ndash;26). Grosseteste&rsquo;s views are compared with those
of Duns Scotus in Lewis (1996).</p>

<p>
This was an innovative theory for dealing with future contingent
statements as omnitemporally true or omnitemporally false or, if these
were tensed, as antecedently true or antecedently false. The
truth-values of statements about contingent things, though temporally
immutable from the beginning of the world and also immutably known by
God, were metaphysically contingent. The consequence from knowledge or
truth to necessity, whether causal or semantic, was denied. The
contingency of the created order was based on God&rsquo;s eternal and
and free providential choice that involved the acts of the created
will as free. Anselm formulated this traditional view, following
Augustine, as follows: &ldquo;It is both necessary that God foreknows
what will come to be and that God foreknows that something will freely
come to be&rdquo; (<em>De concordia praescientiae et praedestinationis
et gratiae Dei cum libero arbitrio</em>, 1.1; cf. Augustine, <em>On
Free Choice of the Will</em>, 3.3.8). Anselm argued that that
predictions are true or false and their truth can be understood as the
correspondence to what will happen, although what will contingently
happen is not known to human beings without supernatural help. This
was the standard view of the possibility of prophesy. (See the above
quotation from Anselm&rsquo;s <em>Cur Deus homo</em>; Peter Abelard,
<em>Glossae super Peri hermeneias</em>, IX.69&ndash;85; Anonymous,
<em>Summa Duacensis</em>, 129&ndash;130.)</p>

<h2 id="LatMedVieFutConDivFor">4. Later Medieval Views on Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge</h2>

<p>
Later medieval figures discussed future contingents in several
contexts, such as in commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Perihermeneias</em> and in questions about God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge and prophesies about future contingent realities. Later
medieval figures were well acquainted with the conception of
God&rsquo;s eternal and timeless knowledge in Augustine and Boethius
and this view continued to play a role in later discussions. As we
will see below, some figures, such as Thomas Aquinas maintain that
future contingent realities are eternally present to God, while
others, such as John Duns Scotus, reject this view and develop
alternative theories to explain God&rsquo;s knowledge of
contingents.</p>

<h3 id="ThoAqu">4.1 Thomas Aquinas</h3>

<p>
Aquinas discusses the truth-values of future contingents in his
commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Perihermeneias</em>. He assumes
that if future propositions have truth-values, then the realities
which they are about must be determined by their antecedent causes
(<em>In libros Perihermeneias</em> I.13). Aquinas&rsquo;s position on
this matter depends on his views about the connection between truth
and being. In Aquinas&rsquo;s view, propositions about the present are
true in virtue of conforming to a presently existing reality. Since
future realities do not yet exist, Aquinas believes that propositions
about the future can only be true in virtue of conforming to a
presently existing cause that will deterministically produce the
corresponding future reality. Thus, future propositions about
necessary events, such as eclipses, can be true in virtue of their
presently existing causes. However, future contingent events cannot be
known through their causes since, given their contingent nature, their
causes may or may not produce them. Like Boethius, Aquinas regards
future contingent propositions as disjunctively true or false. Human
beings can only make conjectures about which contingents will be
realized in the future based on the various degrees of probabilities
corresponding to certain types of causes (<em>In libros
Perihermeneias</em> I.13; Osborne 2008, 227&ndash;232).</p>

<p>
To explain how God has certain knowledge of future contingents,
Aquinas claims that all things are timelessly present to God, who has
direct knowledge of them and their temporal order, though none of them
is past or future with respect to His cognition (<em>Scriptum super
libros Sententiarum</em> I.38.1.4&ndash;5; <em>Summa contra
gentiles</em> I.67; <em>Summa theologiae</em> I.14.13). Accordingly,
those realities which are future from the perspective of human beings
are present to God&rsquo;s eternal vision and thus, known by God with
certainty. Aquinas thinks that when humans prophecy it is due to God
impressing his knowledge on the human intellect (<em>Summa
theologiae</em> II&ndash;2, 171.3, 6). For various interpretations of
Aquinas&rsquo;s views on divine foreknowledge, see Wippel 1985; Craig
1988: 99&ndash;126; Goris 1996; Stump 2003; Marenbon 2005; Knuuttila
2010.</p>

<p>
Medieval critics found the idea that each instant of time is present
to God&rsquo;s non-temporal eternal vision problematic because of the
transitivity and symmetry of the relation of simultaneity. (See John
Duns Scotus, <em>Lectura</em> I.39.1&ndash;5, 23, 28, 87, and further
references in Hoenen 1993: 169&ndash;70.) It would seem to follow that
if the past, present and future are present to God&rsquo;s eternal
vision, then each moment of time is also present to every other moment
of time and the past and future exist in the same way as the present
(Shanley 1997 addresses this objection from Aquinas&rsquo;s
perspective). Contemporary scholars of Aquinas continue to debate
about whether Aquinas believed that the future exists <em>now</em> in
God&rsquo;s sight before it is actualized in time (See Costa 2019 and
2022; Gili 2020).</p>

<p>
Aquinas addresses the question of whether God&rsquo;s certain
knowledge of contingent realities destroys their contingency. One
might think that if God infallibly knows that something is the case,
then it cannot really be otherwise. Aquinas utilizes Boethius&rsquo;s
distinction between conditional or suppositional necessity
(<em>necessitas ex suppositione</em>) and absolute or simple necessity
to address this worry. (Aquinas also refers to this distinction
between necessity of consequence vs. necessity of the consequent.)
While it is true that a thing must be the case on the supposition that
God knows it to be the case, the thing in question may nevertheless be
the effect of causes that operate contingently (<em>Scriptum super
libros Sententiarum</em> I.38.1.5, <em>Summa contra gentiles</em>
I.67, <em>Summa theologiae</em> I, 14.13, <em>De veritate</em> 2.12).
Aquinas uses an analogy to show that necessity of supposition does not
imply absolute necessity: &ldquo;Necessarily, if I see Socrates
sitting, then he is sitting&rdquo; because otherwise I would not be
able to see him sitting. Yet, this does not imply that he cannot do
otherwise. Similarly, &ldquo;Necessarily, if God knows <em>x</em>,
then <em>x</em>&rdquo;, but this does not imply that <em>x</em> is
itself absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>
Scholars have noted a key difference between Aquinas&rsquo;s approach
to God&rsquo;s eternal knowledge of contingents and Boethius&rsquo;s
approach. While Boethius does not emphasize God&rsquo;s causal
production of contingent realities, Aquinas is careful to note that
God&rsquo;s knowledge is the cause of the created realities which he
knows (Shanley 1997). Aquinas states that God&rsquo;s knowledge
relates to all creatures similar to how a craftsman&rsquo;s knowledge
relates to the craft he produces (<em>Summa Theologiae</em> I.14.8).
Thus, in Aquinas&rsquo;s view, God is not a passive spectator taking
in the eternal vision of temporal realities. Rather, all created
temporal realities are eternally present to God because God eternally
causes them.</p>

<p>
Aquinas offers an account of how God&rsquo;s infallible causation of
created realities is compatible with their contingency. In his view,
created effects are not caused by God alone, but by God and created
secondary causes cooperating. He explains that created effects are
necessary or contingent based on whether they are caused by a
necessarily or a contingently operating created secondary cause. The
divine will itself transcends the order of necessary and contingent
causes and God ensures that created effects are necessarily or
contingently caused by willing that they have certain types of created
secondary causes (<em>In libros Perihermeneias</em> I.14; <em>Summa
Theologiae</em> I.19.8). He writes that &ldquo;Not only that which God
wills happens, but it also happens in the mode in which God wills it,
as necessarily or contingently &hellip; According to how it disposes
some things to happen in this way or that way, it adapts causes for
them in the mode which it disposes (De veritate 3.5).&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Some argue that Aquinas was in fact committed to &ldquo;providential
determinism&rdquo; (Porro 2013: 121&ndash;127; Posti 2017: 82), while
others disagree (Torrijos-Castrillejo 2020; Silva 2022; Kopf 2023).
Another difficulty that has been raised for Aquinas&rsquo;s account
regards how his view of God&rsquo;s essential simplicity and
immutability can be compatible with the view that God&rsquo;s eternal
choice could be otherwise. If God&rsquo;s eternal choice cannot be
otherwise, then it would seem that none of the effects that are
produced by it can be otherwise. For responses to this worry, see
Grant forthcoming.</p>

<h3 id="JohDunSco">4.2 John Duns Scotus</h3>

<p>
Scotus&rsquo;s views on future contingents are embedded in his
broader, innovative modal theory. In the medieval Augustinian
tradition metaphysical possibilities were thought to be based on the
divine essence and represented the ways in which it could be imitated
by created things. According to Scotus, however, when God as an
omniscient being knows all possibilities, he does not know them by
turning first to his essence. Possibilities can be known in
themselves; in fact, they would be what they are even if there were no
God. Scotus calls the propositional formulations of pure possibilities
logical possibilities (<em>possibile</em> <em>logicum</em>). These
express things and states of affairs to which it is not repugnant to
be. Possibilities as such have no kind of existence of their own, but
are real in the sense that they form the precondition for everything
that is or can be. Scotus takes it as an obvious fact that there are
contingent states of affairs which could have not been at that very
moment of time at which they are (<em>Ordinatio</em> I.2.1.1&ndash;2,
86). The idea of &ldquo;synchronic contingency,&rdquo; which holds
that <em>not-p</em> remains possible at the very moment when a
contingent <em>p</em> obtains, differed from the traditional view of
the necessity of the present and played an important role in
Scotus&rsquo;s metaphysics. (On Scotus&rsquo;s modal theory, see Vos
<em>et al.</em> 1994; Knuuttila 1996; Normore 1996, 2003; Honnefelder
2005.) Scotus thought that human freedom requires &ldquo;real
potencies&rdquo; for alternatives at the same instant of time (Dumont
1995).</p>

<p>
Regarding divine knowledge, Scotus rejects that God knows contingents
on account of their presence in eternity (<em>Ordinatio</em>
I.38&ndash;39.1&ndash;5, 10). In his view, it would denigrate the
divine intellect to make God dependent upon created objects for
knowledge. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Scotus thinks the
&ldquo;eternity solution&rdquo; destroys the successive or flowing
nature of temporal events by implying that all temporal events exist
at once. Under the influence of Henry of Ghent, Scotus develops an
alternative theory of God&rsquo;s knowledge of contingents, though he
eventually qualified his acceptance of it. (See Hoenen 1993:
177&ndash;179; S&ouml;der 1999: 177&ndash;183; Schabel 2000:
43&ndash;46.)</p>

<p>
A central element in Scotus&rsquo;s theory of God&rsquo;s knowledge of
contingents is the complex (<em>complexio</em>). The complex is an
object of divine thought and volition that is composed of a subject
and predicate term. Presumably, the terms that compose complexes do
not denote objects outside of God&rsquo;s mind since nothing exists
outside of God&rsquo;s mind before an act of his will. Scotus claims
that prior to the activity of God&rsquo;s will, contingent complexes
do not have truth-values. God knows these complexes as neither true
nor false. These neutral propositions obtain their truth-value as a
result of the divine will&rsquo;s joining or dividing the terms that
compose them. For example, when God joins &ldquo;stars&rdquo; and
&ldquo;even in number,&rdquo; he causes there to be a connection
between terms that are not naturally connected. Following the activity
of God&rsquo;s will, the proposition &lsquo;The stars are even in
number&rsquo; becomes true and the proposition &lsquo;The stars are
not even in number&rsquo; becomes false. Once the divine will makes
its choice of which terms to join together, the divine intellect
immediately knows as true or false these propositions that were
previously known as neutral (<em>Reportatio</em> IA.38.1&ndash;2, 37;
<em>Lectura</em> I.39.1&ndash;5, 62; <em>Ordinatio</em>
I.38&ndash;39.1&ndash;5, 23&ndash;24). Scotus&rsquo;s account of
God&rsquo;s knowledge as mediated by propositions serves as a way to
reconcile God&rsquo;s knowledge of every contingent fact with the
successive nature of time. While contingent existents are not always
actual, the terms that represent them are eternally present to
God&rsquo;s mind. By knowing the way in which these terms are composed
by his will, God can know what is, will be, or was the case at any
time in the world, although the realities that correspond to these
propositions may or may not have actual existence.</p>

<p>
Regarding the logical implications of Scotus&rsquo;s theory, Beck 1998
argues that Scotus&rsquo;s theory of the neutral proposition does not
entail that he denied the principle of bi-valence since propositions
are only neutral prior to creation and there is never a time in the
actual world when a proposition lacks a truth-value. It is clear that
Scotus does not think that the definite truth-values of propositions
about future events entails determinism, since he believes that many
future events are due to free causes which he conceives of as choosing
between alternatives without being determined. (See Vos et al. 1994;
S&ouml;der 1999; for some discussions of Scotus&rsquo;s view of the
free acts of the will, see Dumont 2001; Normore 2003: 141&ndash;145;
Langston 2010.) Scotus, however, does not attempt to reconcile
God&rsquo;s knowledge of contingents with human freedom.</p>

<p>
Scotus believes that although the truth-values of future contingent
propositions are determinate, they could be otherwise because
God&rsquo;s eternal choice could be otherwise (<em>Ordinatio</em>
I.38.2, 426). Scotus believes that for a choice to be contingent, the
agent must have a real capacity for opposite alternatives prior to
choosing one of them. Scotus famously attempted to explain the
contingency of God&rsquo;s eternal choice by distinguishing between
instants of nature, which represent natural, rather than temporal,
priority and posteriority. Scotus distinguishes instants of nature in
God&rsquo;s mind to account for how God can encounter opposite
alternatives prior to choosing one of them even though his choice
occurs in an eternal instant that lacks all temporal duration.</p>

<p>
These ideas are not found in Scotus&rsquo;s early questions on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De interpretatione</em> that mostly follow
Boethius&rsquo;s views on future contingents, adding some more
elaborated analyses of the structure of future-tense propositions:
they may signify that it is true now that something will be or signify
that something will be (<em>Opus</em> 2.1.7&ndash;9). See the
translations and commentary in Buckner and Zupko 2014. Thomas Wylton
(ca. 1288&ndash;1304), an early critic of Scotus&rsquo;s ideas, put
forward some propositional distinctions similar to those in
Scotus&rsquo;s questions on <em>De interpretatione</em>. See the
edition and comments in Schabel 2011b; Bornholdt 2017:
116&ndash;120.</p>

<p>
Scotus&rsquo;s theory of God&rsquo;s knowledge of contingents was
adopted by many Franciscan thinkers after him (Schabel 2007: 308).
Yet, some prominent thinkers were critical of his views, including
William of Ockham and Peter Auriol (Schabel 2007; Adams 1987:
1130&ndash;1137). One serious objection raised against Scotus&rsquo;s
view was that God would not be able to know contingents about human
free choices by knowing the determinations of his own will since God
does not determine free human choices. The problem was especially
difficult in the case of human sins since it was standard belief that
although God permits sin, he does not actively will it. Scotus himself
eventually recognized these difficulties with his position. In his
<em>Reportatio Parisiensis</em> I.46.2, he states that there are many
contingent propositions known by God that are not chosen by his will
such as those about creaturely sins (see Frost 2010). Scotus never
explains how God knows such propositions.</p>

<h3 id="WilOck">4.3 William of Ockham</h3>

<p>
Ockham did not accept Scotus&rsquo;s denial of the necessity of the
present (Normore 1982: 371). He thought that real capacities for
opposites are diachronic (<em>Ordinatio</em> d. 38, 581). Yet, he
holds that some aspects of the future, especially human choices, are
contingent. Ockham thinks that, for both philosophical and theological
reasons, future contingent propositions must be either true or false.
As a matter of faith, he believes that God must know the future. On
philosophical grounds, he argues that propositions cannot come to be
true as time goes on. Rather, there must be as many truths as there
are at one time as at another (On these arguments, see Wengert 1987).
Like Scotus, Ockham believes that God knows the future by knowing
propositions about the future, rather than knowing future realities in
themselves in virtue of their presence in eternity. However, as
mentioned above, Ockham rejects Scotus&rsquo;s view that God knows the
truth-values of contingent propositions by knowing the determinations
of His own will. Ockham never offers an explanation of how God derives
knowledge of the truth-values of future contingent propositions. He
writes:</p>

<p>
It must be held beyond question that God knows with certainty all
future contingents&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> He knows with certainty which
part of a contradiction is true and which false&hellip; It is
difficult, however, to see how He knows this [with certainty] since
one part [of the contradiction] is no more determined to truth than
the other&hellip; (<em>Predestination, God&rsquo;s Foreknowledge,
Future Contingents</em>, q. 2, a. 4, trans. Adams and Kretzmann 1983:
48)</p>

<p>
Though he had no theory of how God derives knowledge of the future,
his discussion of the issue of how God&rsquo;s knowledge of future
contingents can be maintained without implying that the future is
determined has been influential in contemporary discussions of
God&rsquo;s foreknowledge. While Scotus preferred to distinguish
God&rsquo;s eternal knowledge and choice from the temporal order
sharply (<em>Lectura</em> I.39.1&ndash;2, n. 28, 85;
<em>Ordinatio</em> I.40, n. 8), Ockham thought that they can be
treated as temporally past. This led him to ask how God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge as something past and hence seemingly necessary is
compatible with the contingency of future things. Ockham&rsquo;s
answer was that even though God&rsquo;s foreknowledge is past, its
content is future, and the past truth of future contingent
propositions in God&rsquo;s immutable but contingent knowledge does
not fall under the necessity of the past (<em>Ordinatio</em> d. 38,
387&ndash;8; <em>Tractatus de praedestinatione</em> 515&ndash;516. For
Ockham&rsquo;s view, see Adams and Kretzmann 1983; Normore 1982). For
example, although it was true in the past that &lsquo;Socrates will
sit at future time <em>t</em>,&rsquo; since this proposition is about
the future, it is not the case that it is necessarily true as other
truths about the past (<em>e.g.</em> &lsquo;Socrates was sitting
yesterday&rsquo;). Though the view is today associated with Ockham,
several thinkers around 1200 similarly accepted that past truths that
are about the future do not fall under necessity of the past (Marenbon
2005, 105&ndash;106; Wci&oacute;rka 2018 and 2020). The view is also
defended by Bonaventure (1221&ndash;1271) and criticized by Aquinas
(Schabel 2000: 37 and 227). Many later thinkers likewise held that
propositions about the future are not subject to necessity of the
past. (See Robert Holkot (ca. 1290&ndash;1349), <em>Sent.</em> II.2 in
<em>Seeing the Future Clearly</em>, 127, 145&ndash;146; Gregory of
Rimini, <em>Lectura</em> <em>super I Sententiarum</em> I.38.2.3
(302&ndash;303); Pierre d&rsquo;Ailly, <em>Quaestiones super libros
Sententiarum</em> I.11.3S; Gaskin 1997; On Holkot&rsquo;s development
of the view see also the entry on
 <a href="../holkot/#DiviFore">Robert Holkot</a>.)
 The &ldquo;Ockhamist&rdquo; view of divine foreknowledge continues to
be defended today in philosophical theology (Zagzebski 1991:
66&ndash;97; See also the entry on
 <a href="../free-will-foreknowledge/#MoliSolu">foreknowledge and free will</a>).
 While contemporary philosophers have developed the theory in various
ways, Ockham himself did not articulate a metaphysical theory to
support his claims regarding future contingent propositions (Wengert
1987).</p>

<p>
Walter Chatton (ca. 1290&ndash;1343) was a contemporary critic of
Ockham&rsquo;s views about future contingents and divine knowledge. He
also addressed the theories of Scotus, Wylton, and particularly Peter
Auriol, his main source of inspiration, but mostly avoided formulating
his own position. For an English translation with a commentary on his
treatises on future contingents, see Bornholdt 2017, and 2019 [Other
Internet Resources]; see also the entry on
 <a href="../walter-chatton/">Walter Chatton</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="PetAur">4.4 Peter Auriol</h3>

<p>
While many later figures held that future contingents must have
truth-values in order to secure God&rsquo;s knowledge of the future,
Peter Auriol is noteworthy for rejecting this view. Auriol equates
immutability with necessity. Accordingly, he thinks that if future
propositions were immutably true or false, they would be necessarily
so. To save the contingency of the future and particularly free
action, he rejects that the principle of bivalence applies to future
propositions and develops a three-valued logic. Auriol claims that God
is aware of the future in an &ldquo;indistant&rdquo; way that does not
imply that future contingent propositions should be treated as true or
false. Auriol&rsquo;s indistant knowledge abstracts from temporality
and simultaneity and is allegedly compatible with God&rsquo;s
necessary immutability and human free will (Schabel 2000:
67&ndash;123; see also the entry on
 <a href="../auriol/#FutConDivFor">Peter Auriol</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Regarding related developments, English 14th-century authors often
commented on the terminological distinctions between determinate and
indeterminate truth and falsity. Walter Burley, Richard of Campsall
(ca.1280-ca.1350), Arnold of Strelley (d. ca. 1347), and Robert Holkot
preferred to call true propositions about future contingent things as
indeterminately or contingently true. Some commentators have argued
that speaking about this special mode of being true or false was an
attempt to modify bivalence by formulating an idea of many-valued
logic, see Normore 1982, 1993; Gelber 2004: 224&ndash;250.</p>

<p>
Auriol&rsquo;s position inspired much critical discussion until the
early sixteenth century. Gregory of Rimini, under the influence of
Francis of Marchia (born ca. 1290), developed a detailed defense of
the universal applicability of the principle of bivalence in response
to Auriol&rsquo;s views see the entry on
 (<a href="../gregory-rimini/#ForeCont">Gregory of Rimini</a>).
 Aspects of Auriol&rsquo;s view came to be regarded as heretical when
a Papal commission made a decision about the theses of Peter de Rivo,
who defended a view similar to that of Auriol. Some of de Rivo&rsquo;s
statements were officially condemned in 1474 by Pope Sixtus IV (Baudry
1989 (ed.), <em>La querelle des futurs contingents (Louvain
1465&ndash;1475). Textes in&eacute;dits</em>; Schabel 1995&ndash;96,
2000: 315&ndash;336, 2003a).</p>

<h3 id="FraMar">4.5 Francis of Marchia</h3>

<p>
Francis of Marchia was especially influential on subsequent medieval
thinkers. Marchia argues that there must be some ground in reality for
the truth of future contingent propositions and God&rsquo;s knowledge
of the future. Marchia locates that ground in the causes of future
contingent realities. He argues that there must be some determination
in the cause of a contingent reality toward producing its effect
otherwise the cause would be indifferent between causing or not
causing its effect and nothing would occur. Marchia distinguishes
between two types of determination and two corresponding types of
indetermination, <em>determinatio</em> and <em>indeterminatio de
inesse</em> and <em>de possibili</em>. <em>Determinatio de inesse</em>
applies to causes and effects and is the ground for foreknowledge.
However, it is compatible with <em>indeterminatio de possibili</em>
which preserves contingency. (On Marchia&rsquo;s views see Marchia
1999, 2000; Schabel 2000; See also the entry on
 <a href="../entries/francis-marchia/#PhiThe">Francis of Marchia</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="ThoBra">4.6 Thomas Bradwardine</h3>

<p>
Thomas Bradwardine&rsquo;s (ca. 1290&ndash;1349) views on future
contingents were also particularly influential. In his <em>De Causa
Dei</em>, Bradwardine defends the view that the future, like all of
temporal history, is necessary relative to God&rsquo;s antecedent
will. Bradwardine&rsquo;s defense of the view that God predestines
everything made him famous both in his own time and in the fifteenth
and sixteenth century (Normore 1982: 374&ndash;376). In his <em>De
futuris contingentibus</em>, which is a question from his
<em>Sentences Lectura</em>, Bradwardine complements the view that
everything is necessary relative to God&rsquo;s will by applying the
distinction between God&rsquo;s absolute and ordained power. Though
contingents are determined by God&rsquo;s ordained power, they could
have been otherwise absolutely speaking since God could have chosen
otherwise by his absolute power (Rossiter 2017). Bradwardine&rsquo;s
views were criticized by his contemporaries Thomas Buckingham (ca.
1300 &ndash; ca. 1345) and Richard Kilvington (ca. 1302&ndash;1361)
(See Genest 1992; Buckingham 1987; Kilvington 2022).
Bradwardine&rsquo;s views were favorably received by others. Just four
years after <em>De causa Dei</em> was published, Pierre Ceffons
(1320&ndash;1380) used Bradwardine as a means to defend an extreme
form of necessitarianism (See Schabel 2020).</p>

<h3 id="LuiDeMolMidKno">4.7 Luis de Molina and Middle Knowledge</h3>

<p>
Those who rejected that God determines the truth-values of future
contingents about free human choices struggled to provide an
explanation of how God knows the future acts of free causes. Luis de
Molina (1535&ndash;1600) developed an influential solution to this
problem. Molina claims that in addition to God&rsquo;s necessary
knowledge of all possibilities and his &ldquo;free&rdquo; knowledge of
his own choices regarding which possibilities to create, God has a
third type of knowledge called &lsquo;middle knowledge&rsquo;
(<em>scientia</em> <em>media</em>). Through his middle knowledge, God
knows prior to creating the world what any possible creature would
freely do in any possible situation (Freddoso 1988). These
counterfactuals about how creatures would freely act are referred to
as &ldquo;middle knowledge&rdquo; because like God&rsquo;s free
knowledge these truths are contingent, yet like God&rsquo;s necessary
knowledge, these truths are not determined by God&rsquo;s will.
Molina&rsquo;s &lsquo;middle knowledge&rsquo; theory was actively
debated in the sixteenth and seventeenth century and continues to be
debated today in contemporary philosophy of religion. For an overview
of the sixteenth century <em>De auxiliis</em> controversy regarding
middle knowledge see Matava 2020. For contemporary defenses of middle
knowledge, see Flint 1998 and Dekker 2000.</p>

<h2 id="LatMedDisFutConProPro">5. Later Medieval Discussions of Future Contingents and the Problem of Prophesy</h2>

<p>
During the decades following Ockham and Auriol the debate about future
contingents focused increasingly on the issue of prophecy (Gelber
2004: 201). Thinkers struggled with how to reconcile the contingent
truth of future propositions revealed by prophets with the inability
of prophecies to go unfulfilled. It would seem that if prophesies
cannot fail to be realized, then the truths revealed by the prophets
must be necessarily true.</p>

<p>
One solution that Ockham presents is the view that prophecies are
actually hidden conditional statements. For example, the prophecy that
&lsquo;Peter will be saved&rsquo; has a hidden antecedent of &lsquo;If
he repents.&rsquo; Thus, even if it comes to pass in the future that
Peter is not saved, the conditional proposition that was prophesied
(<em>i.e.</em> &lsquo;If Peter repents, then he will be saved&rsquo;)
nevertheless remains true. One critique this solution faces is that it
makes prophecies trivial since the conditional proposition is true
regardless of whether the conseuqnet that is uttered to by the propher
does or does not come to pass. (For exposition and analysis of
Ockham&rsquo;s views on prophecy, see Soler 2024.)</p>

<p>
Auriol held that propositions revealed by prophets were neither true
nor false since no future contingent propositions have truth-values.
Even if what a prophet states about the future does not come to pass,
Auriol denies that this makes the prophet a false prophet. In his
view, the criteria for being a true prophet is not the truth of
one&rsquo;s statements, but rather one&rsquo;s intention to express
divine understanding about the things prophesied about (Gelber 2004:
205&ndash;206; Schabel 2000: 67&ndash;132)</p>

<p>
Though Ockham and Auriol addressed the issue of prophecy, Richard
FitzRalph&rsquo;s (1299&ndash;1360) contributions marked a turning
point in scholastic discussions of the topic. He is the first known
figure to devote a separate question in his <em>Sentences</em>
commentary exclusively to the issue the revelation of future
contingents. Furthermore, he gave more attention to the question of
God&rsquo;s revelation of contingents than to the question of
God&rsquo;s foreknowledge of contingents which is where earlier
figures typically addressed issues of the contingency of the future
(Genest 1991: 240). A sign of the growing complexity of the issue of
prophesy and contingency in his time is that he devoted 20,000 words
to the topic, which is more than double the length of Ockham&rsquo;s
discussion (Genest 2023: 276).</p>

<p>
FitzRalph maintains that claims about the future, unless they are
necessary, cannot be certain. Accordingly, revelation about future
contingents, including free actions, cannot be certain. He does not
deny that claims about future contingents may not come to pass.
Rather, his focus is on dissociating the contingency of revelation
from immorality (Leff 1963: 45&ndash;46). He admits that God could
mislead creatures by revealing what is not yet certain, but he
emphasizes that this does not imply that God would do this since his
actions are governed by his goodness (Leff 1963: 49&ndash;50). He
claims that even Christ could prophesy falsely, yet it would not count
as lying or deception since this would require the intention to
deceive which is impossible for Christ to have (Genest 2023:
289&ndash;290). See also the entry on
 <a href="../fitzralph/#DiviForeFutuCont">Richard FitzRalph</a>.</p>
 
<p>
By contrast, Robert Holcot argued that not only could God deceive, but
scripture gives evidence that God has in fact deceived humans on many
occasions, including when Abraham was made to believe that he should
and would kill Isaac (Gelber 2004: 215&ndash;216; Incandela 1994).
Holcot wanted to safeguard the contingency of the future not only to
uphold human freedom, but also to uphold God&rsquo;s freedom to do
otherwise. Adam Wodeham (1295&ndash;1358) similarly argues that if a
prophesy had to be fulfilled once it is uttered, then God would make
himself impotent. He believes that God, by his absolute power, is able
falsify past pronouncements made by prophets as long as the realities
they regard are still future (In Sent. III, d.14, q.4, (Paris, 1512),
fol 125ra; On Wodeham&rsquo;s views see Kennedy 1990; Kennedy 1984
attributes similar views on prophecy to Thomas Buckingham). The view
that Christ could err regarding future contingents was censured in
1347 when John of Mirecourt&rsquo;s views were examined
(Stegm&uuml;ller 1933).</p>
