<h1>Feminist Metaphysics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Feb 27, 2007; substantive revision Fri Nov 8, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Metaphysics is the study of the basic structure of reality, of what
there is and what it is like. It considers, for example, concepts such
as <em>identity</em>, <em>causation</em>, <em>substance</em>, and
<em>kind</em>, that seem to be presupposed by any form of inquiry; and
it attempts to determine what there is at the most general level. For
example, are there minds in addition to bodies? Do things persist
through change? Is there free will or is all action determined by
prior events? But since metaphysics not only concerns itself with what
there is (ontology), but also the nature of that which exists,
metaphysicians also ask, for example, whether numbers, if they exist,
are dependent upon human thought and practices in some way, whether
the concepts and categories we use to think of and describe reality
influence or determine in any way what is described, and whether and
how values are embodied in our categories and descriptions. Such a
project might seem quite alien to feminism, which at first blush seems
to be an engaged, practical, and political project aimed at liberation
(a thought we'll return to in Section 2.3) but feminists have, as a
matter of fact, been remarkably productive in the field of
metaphysics, developing ideas, methods, and positions that have
reshaped both feminism at large and metaphysics more broadly.</p>

<p>
In this entry, we group works in feminist metaphysics under two main
headings according to the way in which a feminist approach is
informing the work. These do not represent defined schools of thought
or sharply separated literatures, but are rather a heuristic device we
employ to structure our discussion. The first group of work focuses on
instances where feminism informs the content of metaphysical inquiry
in the sense that the questions and topics under consideration bear on
feminist projects in the world at large. This includes questions and
topics that are important to understand in order to further feminist
projects, and questions and topics that only come into focus when a
feminist approach is taken. The second group of work focuses on the
application of feminist insights to the key concepts, approaches, and
methods of metaphysics. Here, feminism informs the approach to
metaphysical inquiry; this may, for example, take the form of
identifying male bias in existing approaches. To put this more
colloquially, there are two ways in which as feminist metaphysicians
we may end up doing something distinctive from metaphysics in general:
we may use metaphysics to figure out things that we need to figure out
as feminists and/or that we only noticed because we&rsquo;re
feminists, and we may approach general metaphysical investigations in
different ways because we are feminists.</p>

<h2 id="MetaQuesFemiSign">1. Metaphysical Questions with Feminist Significance</h2>

<p>
The most prominent example of metaphysical questions that bear
importantly on feminist political projects are questions about the
nature of sex and/or gender. These questions are explored in detail in
the entry
 <a href="../feminism-gender/">Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender</a>.
 Accordingly, we will not discuss them here, except to illustrate
broader points. However, feminists have also considered the structure
of social reality and the relationship between the social world and
the natural world more broadly. Because social structures are often
justified as natural, or necessary to control what&rsquo;s natural,
feminists have questioned whether such references to nature are
legitimate. This has led to considerable work on the idea of social
construction that is not limited to the social construction of gender
(or sex, for that matter). Feminists have also sought to understand
the metaphysical aspects of &lsquo;intersectionality&rsquo;, along
with the ways in which social categories (such as gender and race) and
social structures (such as sexism/patriarchy and racism/white
supremacy) are intertwined and co-dependant. Moreover, there has been
a recent surge of interest in the metaphysics of pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="SociCons">1.1. Social Construction</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the area where feminist metaphysicians have made the greatest
strides, and had the most influence, is in the theory of social
 construction.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 In trying to understand the nature of gender and patriarchal
oppression, feminist metaphysicians have developed new tools for
understanding and critiquing different aspects of social reality. Such
tools have been taken up by social ontologists and now constitute a
mainstream part of social ontology. Given that uptake, many of these
tools are now covered in the entry on
 <a href="../social-ontology/">Social Ontology</a>.
 As such, in this section we will highlight three particularly
influential feminist contributions to social ontology that capture the
distinctively political approach to social ontology that feminist
metaphysicians have taken.</p>

<h4 id="IdeaObjeCons">1.1.1 Idea and Object Construction</h4>

<p>
Suppose I say &ldquo;sex is a social construct&rdquo;. One reading of
this claim is that our genitalia, karyotype, secondary sex
characteristics and so on, are literally constructed through social
practices. That is, some group of objects out there in the world
(ovaries, penises, etc.,) is brought into existence or otherwise
dependent on our social practices. Another reading of this claim is
that our concept or ideas about sex categories are dependent on social
practices. That is, our lumping together or grouping of these aspects
of the world (ovaries, penises, etc.,) under the label
&lsquo;sex&rsquo; is dependent on social practices. This is a long way
of saying that we can distinguish the construction of ideas and the
construction of objects (Hacking 1999:
 9&ndash;16).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Now, there&rsquo;s a fairly obvious sense in which our concepts and
ideas are dependent on our social practices. We get taught them
through education and language, and our concepts evolve over time due
to social, historical, and technological change. Even if one thinks
that certain scientific concepts perfectly map onto reality as things
truly are, carving nature at its joints, one still has to recognise
that the scientific development of these concepts is a
socio-historical process: scientific practice is a social practice,
after all. Moreover, scientific practice is not independent of wider
social, economic, and historical forces. Recognising that the concepts
and ideas we use to interpret the world are not (straightforwardly)
&lsquo;read from nature&rsquo;s joints&rsquo; prompts us to ask
questions about the adequacy of our interpretive conceptual framework.
Concepts help us organize phenomena; different concepts organize it in
different ways. It is important, then, to ask: what phenomena are
highlighted and what are eclipsed by a particular framework of
concepts? What assumptions are built into the framework?</p>

<p>
For example, our everyday framework for thinking about human beings is
structured by the assumptions that there are two (and only two) sexes,
and that every human is either a male or a female. But in fact a
significant percentage of humans have a mix of male and female
anatomical features. Intersex people are eclipsed in our everyday
framework (Fausto-Sterling 2000). This should invite us to ask: Why?
Whose interests are served, if anyone&rsquo;s, by intersex people
being ignored in the dominant conceptual framework? (It can&rsquo;t be
plausibly argued that sex isn&rsquo;t important enough to us to make
fine-grained distinctions between bodies!) Further, once we recognize
intersex people, how should we revise our conceptual framework? Should
we group people into more than two sexes, or are there reasons instead
to complicate the definitions of male and female to include everyone
in just two sex categories? More generally, on what basis should we
decide what categories to use? (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Butler 1999: Ch.
1) In asking these questions it is important to remember that an idea
or conceptual framework may be inadequate without being false, e.g., a
claim might be true and yet incomplete, misleading, unjustified,
biased, etc. (Anderson 1995).</p>

<p>
What about the other sort of reading of construction claims, that
there is some object or thing &lsquo;out there&rsquo; in the world
that is the result of, or dependent on, our social practices? There is
a sense in which any artifact is a construction; but claiming that
scissors, bridges, or cars are social constructions would not have
much point, given how mundane this claim would
 be.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Social constructionists, on the whole, are arguing for surprising
theses that they believe challenge our everyday view of things. It is,
after all, rather surprising to say that groups like women,
Asian-Americans, child abusers or refugees are social
constructions.</p>

<p>
One way in which an object can be socially constructed is via social
causation: here, to say that something is socially constructed is to
say that it is caused to be a certain way, and the causal process
involves social factors, e.g., social forces were largely responsible
for my coming to have the idea of a husband, and social forces are
largely responsible for any given person becoming a husband. But often
when theorists argue that something is a social construction, their
point is not about causation. Rather, the point is to distinguish
social kinds from physical kinds. What it is to be a member of the
category husband is to play a particular role in certain social
practices, such as weddings and marriage. Without such social
practices there simply would be no husbands at all. One way of putting
this is that being a husband is <em>constituted</em> by (participation
in) certain social practices or structures.</p>

<p>
Whilst there has been work looking at the constitutive social
construction of sex, it may be easier to begin by thinking about this
idea using the example of gender. In the case of gender, the point is
that gender is not a classification scheme based simply on anatomical
or biological differences, but rather marks social differences between
individuals. We can think of gender in these constitutive terms.
Gender, in this sense at least, is not about testicles and ovaries,
the penis and the uterus, but about a system of social categories,
social practices, social roles, and/or social structures which
constitute what it is to be a member of a given gender (see, e.g.,
Haslanger 2012; also Wittig 1992; Delphy 1984; MacKinnon 1989).
Consider, for example, the category of landlords. To be a landlord one
must be located within a broad system of social and economic relations
which includes tenants, private property, and the like. Imagine that,
by some coincidence, all and only landlords have a mole behind their
left ear. Even if this were the case, having this physical mark is not
what it is to be a landlord. What makes one a landlord is that one
holds a certain position in an economic structure, and plays a roles
in certain economic practices by leasing out one&rsquo;s
 property.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Could sex also be constitutively socially constructed? Certainly
it&rsquo;s a much more controversial claim: whilst an
individual&rsquo;s genitalia might be <em>causally</em> socially
constructed (via e.g., gender-affirming surgery) it seems much harder
to argue that (say) vaginas are <em>constituted</em> by social
practices. One strategy that some feminists have adopted here is to
attempt to show that sex as a set of categories is dependent on
gender. After all, if gender is a set of social practices, and our
norms for categorising people into different sexes is somehow
dependent on or constituted by gender, then sex (at least in this
sense) is socially constructed. Drawing on Monique Wittig, Judith
Butler makes an argument that can be read in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The demarcation of anatomical difference does not precede the cultural
interpretation of that difference, but is itself an interpretive act
laden with normative assumptions. That infants are divided into sexes
at birth, Wittig points out, serves the social ends of reproduction,
but they might just as well be differentiated on the basis of ear lobe
formation or, better still, not be differentiated on the basis of
anatomy at all. In demarcating &lsquo;sex&rsquo; as sex, we construct
certain norms of differentiation. (Butler 1986, 47).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our practices of sexing children take place in a cisheteropatriarchal
society that features a binary gender system. Moreover, (despite
resistance from trans people) this society insists that sex and gender
need to be aligned: indeed this society implicitly claims that sex is
the basis for gender. But what if this gets things the wrong way
around? This Butlerian argument suggests that society, via sexing
practices and surgical interventions on intersex children, is imposing
a binary sex system on a messy, complex biological reality that is far
from featuring two neat binary categories. According to this Butlerian
line of argument, gender (at least in contemporary society) precedes
sex, and constructs sex categories in an attempt to justify a binary
gender system: &ldquo;Instead of sex being a natural category, and
gender the social significance of sex, sex is really a gendered
category posited by us and claimed to be a natural one so that it can
help perpetuate the gender game&rdquo; (&Aacute;sta 2018, 66). Of
course, whether this sort of argument works and whether the resulting
metaphysical picture is attractive has been widely debated in feminist
metaphysics (see e.g., Namaste 2000; Prosser 1998; Butler 1993; Stone
2007; Colebrook 2017; see also the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/#SexGenDis">Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender &sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
It is also significant that not all social kinds are obviously social.
Sometimes it is assumed that the conditions for membership in a kind
concern only or primarily biological or physical facts. Pointing out
that this is wrong can have important consequences. For example, the
idea that whether or not a person is a woman is not simply a matter of
their physical features, but concerns their position in a social
matrix, has been politically significant, and to many surprising. How
should we construe the constructionist move of arguing that a
particular kind is a social kind? What could be interesting or radical
about such a move? Feminist metaphysicians have explored this question
under the label &lsquo;the debunking project&rsquo;.</p>

<h4 id="DebuProj">1.1.2 The Debunking Project</h4>

<p>
Social ontology in feminist thought can be traced to a number of
sources, but perhaps the most prominent is Simone de Beauvoir&rsquo;s
claim that &ldquo;One is not born, but rather becomes, woman&rdquo;
(Beauvoir 1949/2011, 293). In claiming that one is not born a woman,
Beauvoir was not suggesting that one is never born with body parts
like breasts or ovaries; rather, her concern was that possession of
certain body parts, in and of itself, does not imply how one could or
should be socially situated. In spite of this, societies (for the most
part) reserve for people with vaginas and breasts certain social
roles, norms, and activities that disadvantage them in relation to
those with penises and testes. This hierarchy of advantage is
legitimated, claims de Beauvoir, by casting the social order as
necessary because it is tied to these apparently natural features of
men and women (Beauvoir 1949/2011: Ch.1; the literature on de Beauvoir
interpretation here is also vast: see the entry on
 <a href="../beauvoir/">Simone de Beauvoir</a>).</p>
 
<p>
This theme&mdash;that hierarchies are sustained through myths of their
natural basis, and that their social basis is obscured&mdash;has
prompted a <em>tremendous</em> amount of work on the construction of
gender, race, sexuality and
 beyond.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Research in history, anthropology, literature, and sociology has
chronicled the various mechanisms by which gender and other such
categories are enforced, and research in psychology and biology has
further loosened the ties between body types and social roles. Having
witnessed the power of naturalizing &ldquo;myths&rdquo;, feminists
tend to be wary of any suggestion that a category is
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; or that what&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
should dictate how we organize ourselves socially. By contrast, if it
is recognized, as Beauvoir urged, that what women and men are is at
least partly a social matter, this opens up the possibility that
gender roles could and indeed should be made more equitable through
social change.</p>

<p>
As such, many feminist metaphysicians have argued that a necessary
part of feminist praxis will involve <em>debunking</em> claims that
gender and other such categories are i) natural, ii) inevitable, and
iii) without need of justification. (Note that, contrary to a popular
misconception, claiming that something is socially constructed is
<em>not</em> about claiming that that something isn&rsquo;t real!
Social constructionists broadly tend to be realists about the things
that get socially constructed, though this realism comes in stronger
and weaker forms&mdash;see the entry on
 <a href="../social-ontology/">Social Ontology</a>.)
 As &Aacute;sta puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A paradigm case of such a debunking project is to reveal a kind or
category as a social category when it is widely held to be a natural
one. The consequences of this are that the constraints and enablements
that come with membership in the kind are then revealed to need
justification; these constraints and enablements are shown not to be
the result of some natural order of things, beyond the demand for
justification. (&Aacute;sta 2018, 36).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If &Aacute;sta is right, then feminist metaphysicians are, at least in
part asserting the constructedness of gender in order to show that it
is not inevitable that we order our society in the way that we
currently organise things. Once we recognise that things might be
otherwise, we can demand justification for the current gender order,
and, finding such putative justifications of an oppressive social
structure unconvincing, we sow the seeds for political change.</p>

<p>
However, some feminist metaphysicians have disputed the link between
i) on the one hand, and ii) and iii) on the other. That is, they have
denied that something being natural implies that it is inevitable and
not in need of justification. As Louise Antony pointed out, it is
uncontroversial that many people are nearsighted naturally, but we
would be simply wrong to suggest that this is unchangeable: we can,
using things like glasses and laser surgery, alleviate nearsightedness
(Antony 2000, 12). Moreover, given that such options can be made
available, the nearsighted person is well within their rights to call
into question any justification that might be offered for not giving
them access to those options. Applying this thought directly to the
case of gender, the Xenofeminist collective Laboria Cuboniks put it
forcefully: &ldquo;If nature is unjust, change nature!&rdquo;
(Cuboniks 2018,
 93).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The upshot of this Antony-Cuboniks line of argument is that we
don&rsquo;t need a debunking project in order to undermine the claims
that the current order of things is inevitable and that it is not in
need of justification. But this leaves us with a question: what is the
role that claims about the social construction of categories like
gender are playing in <em>feminist</em> metaphysics? Sure, they may
well be true, but absent the debunking project, it&rsquo;s unclear
what role such construction claims play in politically engaged
metaphysics. One option here is to argue that &ldquo;gender is a
social construct&rdquo; is a political slogan, akin to Audre
Lorde&rsquo;s &ldquo;For the master&rsquo;s tools will never dismantle
the master&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (Lorde 2017, 91). Of course, there are
lots of ways to read political slogans, but one such way is as
<em>action-guiding</em>. By employing the slogan &ldquo;gender is a
social construct&rdquo;, we suggest that gender is to be changed by a
particular group of social mechanisms. In doing so, we avoid using the
wrong methods for attempting to change gender. The claim that gender
is a social construct, on this account, becomes a claim about the
tactics and strategies that we ought to use in order to disrupt the
current gender
 order.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="AmelInqu">1.1.3 Ameliorative Inquiry</h4>

<p>
Sally Haslanger points out that when researching social concepts,
there are a number of types of project that we could undertake
(Haslanger 2012). One option would be a traditional philosophical
inquiry, analysing the concept as we take it to be &ndash; the
manifest concept. Another would be an empirical inquiry studying the
concept that actually gets used in practice &ndash; the operative
concept. Think, for instance, of a teacher, who (for whatever reason)
thinks of the category parent solely in terms of biological
progenitors. However, when it comes to sending out invitations for
school parents evenings, the teacher sends out invites to all primary
caregivers and guardians of the children in their class, regardless of
whether or not they are biological progenitors of their children. In
this example the teacher has a manifest concept of parent as
biological progenitor, and an operative concept of parent as primary
caregiver. However, we might also ask, what concept of parent
<em>should</em> the teacher be using?</p>

<p>
This kind of question motivates what Haslanger has called
&lsquo;ameliorative inquiry&rsquo;: inquiry into the concepts that we
ought to use, given our particular goals. This is an explicitly
normative methodology, driven by a variety of values that we might
want in a given concept, whether those are epistemic values (such as
simplicity, fruitfulness, and exactness, c.f, Carnap 1962) or moral
and political values (such as taking people&rsquo;s agency seriously,
promoting justice, and explaining
 inequality).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Consulting these values, and the pragmatic constraints of the context
that one has in mind, the ameliorative theorist figures out which
concept of (say) parent we ought to use, designing a new one if none
of the existing concepts work, or calling for abolition if no concept
will work at all.</p>

<p>
As Haslanger famously put it, rather than simply asking &lsquo;what is
gender?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what is race?&rsquo; the ameliorative
theorist asks, &lsquo;what do we want gender to be?&rsquo; and
&lsquo;what do we want race to be?&rsquo; However, put this way, one
is liable to misunderstand ameliorative analysis as Haslanger conducts
it. The question &lsquo;what do we want race to be?&rsquo; might seem
like it is asking what we want our racial categories to look like in
the future, or what race might look like (if it exists at all) in a
less racist world. However, Haslanger is more interested in asking
what the best concept of race is for explaining, understanding, and
critiquing existing racial oppression and racist social structures.
Matthew J. Cull has described the distinction here as one between
positive ameliorative critique and negative ameliorative critique:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Haslanger is pointing to what she takes to be a useful concept for
understanding extant oppressive society and asks us to take political
action to do away with the social structures that her concept picks
out. This is not a guide for how to organize society in the future
(beyond a very limited sense: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t do things this
way!&rsquo; seems like a clear conclusion for any reader of
Haslanger). The task of thinking about what concepts we want to use in
guiding how we organize society in the future, then, can and does come
apart from the task of thinking about what concepts allow us to best
understand and critique existing society. Let us call the former
(interested, as it is, in tearing down an unjust old world)
&lsquo;negative critique&rsquo; and the latter (interested in building
a new, more just, world) &lsquo;positive critique&rsquo;. (Cull 2024,
18).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Haslanger&rsquo;s negative ameliorative critique leads her to accounts
of gender and race in terms of hierarchical social structures,
accounts which have been the subject of intense scrutiny over the past
two decades (see e.g., Mills 2014, Jones 2014, Haslanger 2014, Mikkola
2016, Bettcher 2012 and Jenkins 2016). Whether or not she is right
about the particular concepts of gender and race that we ought to use,
her work in laying out ameliorative inquiry as a philosophical method
has led to the (re)birth of the growing field of conceptual
engineering (see, e.g., Burgess and Plunkett 2013; Burgess, Cappelen
and Plunkett 2020; and Cappelen
 2018).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Meanwhile, feminist metaphysicians have taken up Haslanger&rsquo;s
methodology in a variety of ways. One key area of work here has been
alternative ameliorative accounts of gender that take trans
experiences seriously. Here, for example, Katharine Jenkins has put
forward a dualist account of gender (Jenkins 2016), whilst Matthew J.
Cull has used a positive ameliorative analysis of gender to argue for
pluralism about gender (Cull 2024). However, feminist metaphysicians
have not limited themselves to ameliorative accounts of gender. For
example, Kate Manne has offered an ameliorative account of misogyny
and sexism (Manne 2016), Deborah M&uuml;hlebach and Emily McWilliams
have advocated for the adoption of ameliorative methods in
epistemology (M&uuml;hlebach 2016; McWilliams 2022), and Emily McGill
has interpreted the feminist debates over relational autonomy as
attempts at ameliorative inquiry (McGill 2020). Meanwhile, Robin
Dembroff has developed an ameliorative account of sexuality (Dembroff
2016), and Elizabeth Barnes has used the method to provide an account
of disability (Barnes
 2016).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="Inte">1.2. Intersectionality</h3>

<p>
The concept of &lsquo;intersectionality&rsquo; draws attention to the
ways in which ostensibly different modes of domination, oppression, or
discrimination, such as race and gender, are intermeshed in complex
ways such that it is often impossible to fully distinguish one
dimension from another in a person&rsquo;s
 experience.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 Although the idea has a longer history, especially in feminist
thought and activism undertaken by Black women and women of colour
(see, for example, Combahee River Collective 1978; Moraga and
Anzald&uacute;a 1981/2015, along with antecedents in the 19th century
such as Sojourner Truth's famous &ldquo;Ain't I a Woman?&rdquo;
speech), the term was introduced by the philosopher and legal scholar
Kimberl&eacute; Williams Crenshaw in the context of theorising the
failure of U.S. anti-discrimination law to protect Black women. Since
Black women were required to prove discrimination the grounds of
<em>either</em> race <em>or</em> sex, in order to bring a successful
case they needed to show that the discriminatory treatment also
extended to either Black men (in order to show it was on the grounds
of race) or White women (in order to show it was on the grounds of
sex). This meant that discrimination directed at Black women
specifically could not be effectively identified or addressed within
the U.S. legal system. Crenshaw described Black women as occupying an
&ldquo;intersection&rdquo; between race and sex/gender, using the
metaphor of a traffic intersection or road junction: &ldquo;If an
accident happens at an intersection, it can be caused by cars
traveling from any number of directions and, sometimes, from all of
them&rdquo; (Crenshaw 1989, 149). Similarly, Crenshaw argued, when
Black women suffered discrimination this could be (a) on the grounds
of sex, (b) on the grounds of race, (c) a result of &ldquo;the
combined effects&rdquo; of both race and sex discrimination
simultaneously, or (d) a more distinctive form of discrimination that
is &ldquo;not the sum of race and sex discrimination, but
[discrimination] as Black women&rdquo; (149). In a paper published
soon afterwards, Crenshaw (1991) extended her analysis by arguing that
social movement organization and advocacy also frequently overlook the
distinctive vulnerabilities of Black women and other women of colour.
Crenshaw&rsquo;s work in these papers built on earlier work by women
of colour arguing that attempts to specify the nature of racial
oppression without reference to gender tend to end up focusing on the
experiences of men of colour, whilst attempts to specify the nature of
gendered oppression without reference to race tend to end up focusing
on the experiences of White women (hooks 1981; Hull, Scott, and Smith
1982). The result of such a non-intersectional approach,
intersectionality&rsquo;s proponents tend to argue, is an analysis
that is empirically inadequate for explaining the ways in which
oppression features in the lives of women of colour, and other groups
situated at the intersections of forms of oppression that are often
theorized as distinct.</p>

<p>
Over the intervening decades, intersectionality has emerged as
&ldquo;a method and a disposition, a heuristic and analytic
tool&rdquo; (Carbado et. al. 2013, 303) used frequently across many
disciplines including law, politics, and sociology, and philosophy.
Overall, the concept of intersectionality encourages us to see racism,
sexism, heterosexism, disablism, classism, and other modes of
domination as intermeshed, rather than separate, and draws our
attention to the dangers of trying to analyse them in isolation from
one another. There is, however, no consensus over where the boundaries
of the phenomenon of intersectionality lie; for example, Patricia Hill
Collins uses the term &lsquo;matrix of domination&rsquo; to refer to
the complex interlocking of oppressive societal organizations,
reserving &lsquo;intersectionality&rsquo; for interlocking that
manifests within a person&rsquo;s lived experience, but many other
theorists would use the term &lsquo;intersectionality&rsquo; for both
levels (Collins 2000: 18; for discussion, see Bilge 2010). Significant
political disagreements also characterise the literature on
intersectionality; for example, Sirma Bilge argues that as the concept
of intersectionality has become more widely used, it has also been
&lsquo;commodified and colonized for neoliberal regimes&rsquo;,
stripping it of its roots in radical politics and neutralizing its
political potential (Bilge 2013, 407).</p>

<p>
In terms of metaphysics, Crenshaw and many others emphasise that
intersectionality should not be understood as a specific theoretical
position or claim but rather as &ldquo;a heuristic term to focus
attention on the vexed dynamics of difference and the solidarities of
sameness in the context of antidiscrimination and social movement
politics&rdquo; (Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 2013, 787). In a similar
spirit, Ann Garry arguers for treating intersectionality as a
&ldquo;framework checker&rdquo; (2011, 830) for accounts of
oppression, social kinds, identity, and so on, rather than as a
substantive account of these things. But although intersectionality
does not provide a position on specific metaphysical questions, the
use of intersectionality as a heuristic or framework checker has
shaped several strands of inquiry in feminist metaphysics. Most
notably, perhaps, debates about the nature of sex and/or gender kinds
or categories have been closely concerned with the ways in which
intersectionality complicates talk of, for example,
&ldquo;women&rsquo;s social situation&rdquo;; see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/#ProSexDis">Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender, section 3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
When the concept of intersectionality is applied to metaphysical
questions about the nature of oppression, it can be seen as
potentially justifying four claims. The first claim is that oppression
is non-additive, which is to say that we cannot rely on being able to
gain knowledge about Black women&rsquo;s oppression, for example,
simply by adding together some general claims about race-based
oppression and some general claims gender-based oppression.
Experiences of oppression (and indeed privilege) are often &lsquo;more
than the sum of their parts&rsquo;, or as Crenshaw puts it, &ldquo;the
intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and
sexism&rdquo; (1989, 140). Taking a blanketly additive approach is a
recipe for building a picture of oppression that only does justice to
the experiences of the most relatively privileged members of the
oppressed group &ndash; for example, an account of women&rsquo;s
oppression that centres the experiences of white, middle-class,
heterosexual women and overlooks or belies the experiences of women of
colour, working class women, and queer women (Spelman 1988, Ch. 6).
This recognition is compatible with allowing that in some specific
cases, dimensions of oppression may behave in additive ways; the
important point is that we cannot <em>rely on</em> or <em>assume</em>
additivity.</p>

<p>
The second, very closely related claim is that oppression is
non-separable: the oppression experienced by a woman of colour, for
example, cannot be neatly separated into the oppression she
experiences as a woman and the oppression she experiences as a person
of colour (Crenshaw 1989; Spelman 1988). If a Black woman is arrested
on suspicion of engaging in sex work by a police officer who then
sexually assaults her, does this happen &lsquo;because she is a
woman&rsquo; or &lsquo;because she is Black&rsquo;? If an Asian woman
is given appalling medical care when she arrives at a hospital in the
middle of what turns out to be a miscarriage, does this happen
&lsquo;because she is a woman&rsquo; or &lsquo;because she is
Asian&rsquo;? The concept of intersectionality highlights the
fundamentally misguided nature of questions such as these, which
assume that the effects of race and gender categorization are neatly
separable. It requires us instead to recognize that the oppression
experienced by a Black woman, for example, cannot usually be neatly
separated out into oppression experienced &lsquo;on the basis of
race&rsquo; and oppression experienced &lsquo;on the basis of
gender&rsquo;. Even where there are similarities between the
experiences of Black women and White women, or Black women and Black
men, race and gender are very often inextricably intertwined and
entangled in ways that make neat separation impossible, and attempts
to perform such separation unhelpful. As with non-additivity, the
point is not that oppressions can never be separated out in this way,
but rather that we cannot count on their being separable in any given
case. Although non-additivity and non-separability are conceptually
very close &ndash; it is natural to think that it is precisely because
experiences of oppression are non-additive that they cannot be
separated into their component parts (Haslanger 2014, 116) &ndash; it
may be worth including both points in an analysis of
intersectionality, because they can be seen as cautioning us against
different kinds of mistakes (Jenkins 2023): non-additivity cautions us
against thinking that we can move smoothly from an analysis of
single-axis oppressions to an analysis of the experience of those
situated at the intersections of these axes, while non-separability
cautions us against thinking we can move smoothly in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>
The third claim, which is rather stronger than the first two, is that
oppression involves involve cross-constitution or mutual constitution
at the level of kinds. It is not just that race and gender kinds
interact via forms of oppression that are non-additive and
non-separable; rather, race plays a crucial role in constructing the
reality of gender, and vice versa (Lugones 2007; Garry 2011;
Carastathis 2014; Snorton 2017; Bernstein 2020; for a helpful taxonomy
of different ways of elaborating this claim, see Jorba and
Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate 2019). In other words, gender either
<em>would</em> not or (more strongly) <em>could</em> not be what it is
if race did not exist, and race would or could not be what it is if
gender did not exist; race and gender help make each other what they
are. This claim goes beyond the non-additivity and non-separability
claims. Accepting those claims means thinking that racism and sexism
combine in ways that exceed the sum of their parts, and therefore
experiences of oppression cannot be broken down into constituent parts
in which race and gender feature as separate; but one might think all
of this whilst holding that there are race kinds that do not depend
for their existence on gender kinds, and vice versa. To accept
cross-constitution is therefore to accept a further, stronger claim in
addition to non-additivity and non-separability.</p>

<p>
The fourth claim, which is stronger again, is that intersectional
kinds such as &lsquo;Black women&rsquo; have greater explanatory power
than their apparent constituent parts such as &lsquo;Black&rsquo; and
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;: we can get further with our explanations of
phenomena such as oppression and domination if we use intersectional
kinds such as &lsquo;Black woman&rsquo; rather than kinds such as
&lsquo;Black&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo; (Bernstein 2020, 331; in
its strongest form, this claim is rejected by Crenshaw 2010; for
critical discussion see Jenkins 2023, 112&ndash;113).</p>

<p>
The tools of analytic metaphysics are increasingly being explicitly
applied to the concept of intersectionality. Marta Jorba and Maria
Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate consider how, exactly, social categories
should be understood in the context of intersectionality theorizing;
if the intersectionality theorist is saying that two things (two
social categories) are interacting, mutually constituting each other,
or something similar, <em>precisely what sort of things</em> should we
take these to be? Jorba and Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate argue that
conceiving of social categories as if they were objects makes it
difficult to uphold the claims made by intersectionality theorists,
but that we fare better if we understand social categories in terms of
properties (of individuals and of social systems). Based on this, they
argue for an emergentist understanding of intersectionality, according
to which someone&rsquo;s overall experience is the result of the
interaction of their various properties (their gender, their race,
their class, and so on) but has distinctive features that
&lsquo;emerge&rsquo; from that interaction, such that
&ldquo;understanding certain behavior of single categories (gender,
race, etc.) is not sufficient to capture the properties of the
emergent experience&rdquo; (Jorba and Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate 2019,
191; emergentism about intersectionality is further developed in Jorba
and L&oacute;pez de Sa forthcoming; see also the entry on
 <a href="../properties-emergent/">Emergent Properties</a>).
 Such a view, they argue, enables us to say that social categories and
systems &ldquo;maintain their own ontological character while allowing
their effects to be in complex relations&rdquo; (Jorba and
Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate 2019, 198), giving (they contend) a
plausible elaboration of the mutual constitution claim. Sara Bernstein
(2020) argues that intersectionality should be understood in terms of
the metaphysical and explanatory priority of the intersectional
category over its constituents (for example, of the categories
&lsquo;Black woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Black man&rsquo; over the
category &lsquo;Black&rsquo;, or the categories &lsquo;disabled
woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;able-bodied woman&rsquo; over the category
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;). Metaphysical priority means that the category
&lsquo;Black woman&rsquo; is understood to exist at a more fundamental
level than the categories &lsquo;Black&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo;;
the latter two categories depend partly on the former for their
existence, but not vice versa . Following Schaffer (2010), Bernstein
likens this to the priority of a circle over its semicircles.
Metaphysical priority is one of a number of options for elaborating on
the metaphysics involved in the cross-constitution claim, and is a
rival view to Jorba and Rod&oacute;-Z&aacute;rate&rsquo;s emergentist
account. Explanatory priority is a version of the fourth of the four
claims explained above, namely that categories such as &lsquo;Black
woman&rsquo; partly explain categories such as &lsquo;Black&rsquo; and
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;, but not vice versa; as Bernstein puts it,
&ldquo;[t]he intuitive idea is that in understanding black womanhood,
we thereby understand blackness and womanhood&rdquo; (2020: 331).
Bernstein argues that allocating a combination of metaphysical
priority and explanatory priority to the intersectional category in
comparison to its constituents provides the best metaphysical model of
intersectionality (for a critical response, see Lawford-Smith and
Phelan 2021). Whichever view is preferred, the application of detailed
concepts and theories of analytic metaphysics to intersectionality
marks an interesting development in feminist metaphysics, even though
(as with most of the developments surveyed here) its interest is not
confined to the field of feminist metaphysics but extends to social
metaphysics more broadly.</p>

<p>
Whilst the study of the metaphysics of intersectionality is an
exciting direction that feminist metaphysics has taken in recent
years, one might wonder whether the worry that Bilge raised for wider
uptake of the concept of intersectionality has a corollary for
metaphysics. As noted above, Bilge was worried that much of the uptake
of intersectionality has stripped it of its radical politics,
employing it in buttressing neoliberal and colonial projects rather
than in tearing them down. Whilst it seems that most feminist
metaphysicians studying intersectionality are not employing the
concept in ways that support reactionary political formations, we
might worry that a focus on the <em>metaphysics</em> of
intersectionality strips the concept of intersectionality of its
political content. Certainly, the abstract nature of metaphysics means
that it is sometimes difficult to see what the political upshot of
such discussions are. For instance, it&rsquo;s far from clear what
<em>political</em> difference it makes if we prefer a prioritarian
over an emergentist view about the metaphysics of intersectionality.
Now, the feminist metaphysician might protest here that their work is
aimed at deepening our understanding of intersectionality, and that
this deepened understanding is a) compatible with radical political
claims, and b) not (always) going to have direct political upshots.
Whether or not such a response is successful, this Bilge-inspired
worry gestures towards a tension that all feminist metaphysicians must
grapple with: how to reconcile the often abstract nature of their
study with the grounded challenges of feminist praxis.</p>

<h3 id="SociStruSociSyst">1.3 Social Structures and Social Systems</h3>

<p>
Feminist metaphysics has explored social structures and social systems
in relation to sexist injustice and oppression. An influential
position on this topic has been developed by Sally Haslanger across a
series of related papers (2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024).
Haslanger argues that we should understand forms of injustice such as
sexism and racism primarily in terms of &ldquo;unjust and interlocking
social structures&rdquo; (2015, 2). At least three metaphysical
questions are raised by this approach: (1) What are social structures?
(2) What difference does a structural analysis make to our
understanding of phenomena such as sexism? (3) What does it mean for
social structures to be
 &ldquo;interlocking&rdquo;?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="NatuSociStruSociSyst">1.3.1. The Nature of Social Structures and Social Systems</h4>

<p>
Haslanger differentiates social social structures from social systems,
and explains both by appeal to social practices. Social practices, for
Haslanger, are &ldquo;learned patterns of behavior that draw on social
meanings to enable us to coordinate around the production, management,
disposal of things of (positive or negative) value&rdquo;, while
social structures are &ldquo;networks of social relations that are
constituted through practices&rdquo; (2023, 14). Social systems,
finally, are collections of objects actually standing in these social
relations to one another. On this view, a structure is something like
a template that can be filled in in many different ways, and a system
is a particular way in which that structure has in fact been filled in
concretely. Social practices are the patterns of organised activity
that determine both what the template is like and how it gets filled
in (in particular cases).</p>

<p>
To illustrate this, consider the social practices that organise family
relations, such as the practice of treating children under a specific
age (18, say) as legal minors who are under the care of certain
adults, where those adults have a range of responsibilities and
prerogatives relative to those children. As part of these practices,
people are habituated to thinking about family relations along
particular lines, and this facilitates coordination (from people both
within and outside familiar) around specific ways of doing various
things. For example, parents and guardians expect to be held
responsible for providing care for their minor children, and
schoolteachers tend not to take pupils on school trips without the
consent of their parents or guardians. There is co-ordination here:
typically, a schoolteacher organising a school trip knows that they
need to obtain such consent, and a parent or guardian receiving a
letter from the school seeking such consent will understand easily
what is needed from them. Because these social practices are in place,
people come to stand in social relations to one another, such as
<em>being the parent of so-and-so</em> and <em>being the minor child
of so-and-so</em>. The abstract form of these social relations
constitutes a social structure, and whenever those relations are
filled in by particular individuals, a social system exists.
Accordingly, multiple distinct systems can instantiate one and the
same structure, because the different individuals in those different
systems stand in the same social relations to one another. For
example, consider a very simple family structure formed of one parent
and one child who is a legal minor. Jane (Tommy&rsquo;s parent) and
Tommy (Jane&rsquo;s minor child) stand in this relation to one
another, while Fuad (Roza&rsquo;s parent) and Roza (Fuad&rsquo;s minor
child) also stand in this same relation to one another, forming a
different family system. The structure is the
one-parent-one-minor-child family, consisting of the <em>parent-minor
child</em> relation, which exists in virtue of the relevant social
practices. So here we have two systems (the Jane-and-Tommy family, and
the Fuad-and-Roza family) and one structure (the
one-parent-one-minor-child family).</p>

<p>
While Haslanger theorises social <em>structures</em> and social
<em>systems</em> in a closely integrated way, other philosophers have
engaged with one or the other notion. Katherine Ritchie (2020), for
example, offers an account of social structures that accords with the
account of social structures given by Haslanger. According to Ritchie
(405), social structures are &ldquo;complexes, networks, or
&lsquo;latticworks&rsquo; of relations&rdquo; composed of nodes and
edges. A node in a structure is defined by its relations to other
nodes in the structure together with any restrictions or requirements
on the objects that can occupy the node, while an edge is a relation
between nodes. Ritchie uses this conception of social structure to
theorise two different kinds of social groups: &ldquo;organized social
groups&rdquo;, such as a specific football team, are structured wholes
while &ldquo;feature social groups&rdquo;, such as football fans, are
nodes in a social
 structures.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 On the other hand, an account of certain sorts of social systems is
given by Robin Dembroff (2024). Dembroff focuses only on the types of
social systems that reproduce injustice, such as sexism:
&ldquo;systems of injustice&rdquo; (390). They take a system of
injustice to be &ldquo;the historical process of reproducing an
ideology&rdquo; (390) through causal looping. Dembroff&rsquo;s account
differs from Haslanger&rsquo;s account of social systems in not
highlighting either practices as the building block of social systems
or the link between systems and structures, but there is a shared
emphasis between the two views on causal looping; i.e. the iterative

<h4 id="ExplValuSociStucSociSyst">1.3.2. The Explanatory Value of Social Structures and Social Systems</h4>

<p>
An important strand of investigation into social structures and social
systems concerns their role in explanation. As Haslanger (2016; 2023)
points out, sometimes, we are better able to explain the behaviour of
some entity once we see it as incorporated within a larger system. For
example, if we want to explain why Tommy moved house from London to
Edinburgh in June 2024, it is extremely helpful to understand that
Tommy is Jane&rsquo;s minor child, that Jane moved house from London
to Edinburgh in June 2024 in order to start a new job, and that there
are social practices in place that condition parents to keep their
minor children with them and under their care in most circumstances.
In other words, we need to recognise that Tommy is part of the
Jane-and-Tommy family unit, and then we can explain Tommy&rsquo;s move
to Edinburgh by saying that <em>this family unit</em> moved because of
Jane&rsquo;s new job. If we just tried to explain why Tommy moved
house, without reference to the family unit that he is a part of, we
would not get very far at all. For example, we may not be able to
appeal to Tommy&rsquo;s desires to explain his moving to Edinburgh,
because Tommy may have wanted to stay in London since it&rsquo;s where
all his friends are. We can also use social structures to explain more
general phenomena, such as patterns in household income distribution,
by making observations such as: &lsquo;single-parent families are more
likely to experience poverty than two-parent families&rsquo; and
accounting for the features of social practices that underpin these,
such as the tension between the types of caregiving activities that
parents are expected to undertake with respect to their minor children
(collecting them from school at 3.30pm, say) and the demands of many
jobs (working at least from 9am to 5pm, say).</p>

<p>
Lauren Ross (2024) builds on this account of the role of social
structures in explanations by arguing that it is more informative to
think of the role of social structures in explanation in terms of
&lsquo;causal constraints&rsquo; than in terms of part-whole
relations, where causal constraints are special types of causes that
can condition the influence of other causal factors. As Ross puts it,
a causal constraint &ldquo;guides, limits, and channels the cause it
interacts with&rdquo; (177), as when a wire connecting a switch and a
lightbulb makes it the case that pressing the switch will turn on the
lightbulb. Ross agrees with Haslanger that social structures explain
outcomes because they constrain and enable the behaviour of
individuals. However, Ross argues that cashing this out in terms of
part-whole relations does not explain why some part-whole relations
are explanatory in a given case while others are not (for example, as
well as being part of his family unit, Tommy is also a part of the
whole that is his class at school &ndash; but <em>this</em> part-whole
relationship doesn&rsquo;t explain his move to Edinburgh in the
slightest). By contrast, a causal constraint model can explain this
well: to say that social structures function as causal constraints on
the behaviour of individuals is to say that &ldquo;[s]ocial structure
imposes limitations on which options are available to individuals,
while their agency performs the selection&rdquo; (Ross 2024, 173).
Sometimes, these limitations amount to an &lsquo;extreme
constraint&rsquo;, in that it leaves an individual with only one
course of action open to them, or a &lsquo;strong constraint&rsquo;,
in that it makes all courses of action but one very costly or
difficult. In those cases social structures play a large causal role
in the relevant outcome. In other cases, the limitations are more
modest, leaving open a significant number of different courses of
action that are reasonably achievable, and accordingly playing a much
smaller causal role in the outcome in question.</p>

<p>
While the best way of cashing out the constraining and enabling
functions of social structures is disputed, the fact that social
structures and social systems do constrain and enable the actions of
individuals is significant for accounts of their metaphysics. In
particular, it is crucial for Haslanger&rsquo;s (2023) claim that the
relations that constitute social systems are not mere imagined
abstractions, but rather exist in the world as parts of particular
systems. For example, if Fuad were to sign Tommy&rsquo;s consent form,
the school would not accept it as giving permission for Tommy to go on
the school trip, because Fuad is not Tommy&rsquo;s parent; but Jane
has the ability to give a signature for Tommy that is efficacious. The
<em>parent-minor child</em> relation, as Haslanger puts it,
&ldquo;sets background conditions on and affects what forms of
parental agency are possible&rdquo; (2023, 6). Thus, since she claims
that social structures are networks of social relations, and since
relations are causally efficacious and not merely abstract or
imagined, so too, in her view, are social structures.</p>

<p>
Of course, most systems are much more complicated than the simple
two-person family systems that have been discussed here. In
particular, when we are thinking about social systems, we need to keep
in mind that they exhibit &ldquo;dynamic homeostasis&rdquo; (Haslanger
2023, 8) in that they maintain themselves in a similar form over time
without planning or oversight from a central authority. And we also
need to remember that the individuals caught up in social systems are
shaped by those systems. For example, Fuad may internalise the ideas
about what it means to be a parent that are common in his society, and
this may change him as a person. Perhaps he picks up on the idea that
parents ought to impose routine and structure for the children, and he
becomes a much more organised and rule-oriented person than he used to
be before he was a parent. As Haslanger puts it, &ldquo;we come to
&lsquo;fit&rsquo; niches in the structure by, among other things,
internalizing the relevant norms for the positions we occupy&rdquo;
(2023, 9). This serves to highlight one of the ways in which social
structures and social systems are taken to be extremely important for
political projects such as feminism: they shape the operations of
social power. (This point is accorded a prominent role in &Aring;sa
Burman&rsquo;s account of social facts (2023, chapter 6)).</p>

<p>
Importantly for feminist purposes, being differently situated within a
social system makes people differentially vulnerable to one another.
For example, a parent has power over their minor child that their
minor child does not have over them. If the parent and child disagree,
their bargaining situations are not equal, as the parent has more
options than the child. A gendered example of this, discussed by
Cailin O&rsquo;Connor (2019), is the social norms that make women more
responsible than men for the care of dependents such as children.
Through filling the role of <em>woman</em> in a system that ties this
role to responsibility for children, an individual may come to care
more about promoting the welfare of (some particular) children than
another individual who occupies the role of <em>man</em>. If those two
individuals then negotiate together to decide on some joint outcome,
they will be doing so from different positions, since the former will
be aiming to protect the interests of the children but the latter will
not, and the latter will therefore have an advantage in the
negotiations (O&rsquo;Connor 2019, 117). Since this inequality arises
from the way the individuals are situated in a social system, it
highlights the importance for feminist politics of understanding
social systems and the social structures that they partake in.</p>

<h4 id="IndiInteSociStruSociSyst">1.3.3. The Individuation and Interaction of Social Structures and Social Systems</h4>

<p>
One aspect of the complexity of social structures and social systems
concerns their distinctness and interdependency: when can we say we
have two different social structures on our hands, rather than one
more complex and extensive social structure? And when we do have two
different social structures, what does it mean to say that they are
&ldquo;interlocking&rdquo; (Haslanger 2015, 2) (or
&lsquo;interdependent&rsquo;, &lsquo;intersecting,
&lsquo;overlapping&rsquo;, etc)? These questions are significant in
relation to debates about intersectionality (see &sect;2 above):
arguably, an intersectional perspective directs us to attend to the
interactions between social structures and systems of racism (white
supremacy, white dominance...) and sexism (patriarchy,
cis-hetero-masculine dominance...) and to at least take seriously the
hypothesis that they do not form two distinct social systems, but are
part of one larger social system.</p>

<p>
Haslanger (2020) endorses this hypothesis, arguing that it is not
useful to posit a distinct social system, &lsquo;patriarchy&rsquo;,
that embeds the subordination of women into society. One consideration
she offers in support of this position is that a common way to
differentiate social systems from one another is by the domains of
life they apply to, or the types of goods they regulate; in this
spirit, we can talk of &lsquo;the food production system&rsquo; or
&lsquo;the healthcare system&rsquo;. But gendered power divisions seem
pervasive across different areas of social life in a way that makes
this way of individuating systems an unpromising candidate for
individuating a social system of &lsquo;patriarchy&rsquo;. Another
option is to see the notion of patriarchy as superceded by an account
of capitalism as an over-arching social system that includes gendered
divisions of power (Fraser and Jaeggi 2018). Haslanger rejects this
view on the grounds that it does not adequately explain how male
domination (as we know it) is produced by capitalism. Instead,
Haslanger argues, we should think of the social order as &ldquo;a
<em>capitalist white supremacist nationalist ableist ageist
heteronormative &hellip;etc&hellip;. patriarchal order&rdquo;</em>,
and &ldquo;treat the mentioned elements as analytical categories that
can be used to explain certain features of the system&rdquo; (2020,
226). Thus, the disproportionately high rates of harassment suffered
by politicians and public figures who are women of colour, for
example, might be explained in terms of the white supremacist and
patriarchal elements of the social order, <em>without</em> positing
distinct social systems of white supremacy and patriarchy that are
thought to exist separately from capitalism, nationalism, and so on
(see also Hartmann 1981, Vogel 1983, Arruza 2016 and Wills 2018).</p>

<p>
Robin Dembroff (2024) argues, contra Haslanger, that we
<em>should</em> believe in the existence of a distinct social system
of patriarchy, and others such as white supremacy, whilst
understanding such systems to &ldquo;intersect&rdquo; (385) with one
another. More precisely, Dembroff argues, patriarchy and white
supremacy are <em>co-constituted</em>, meaning that they are made up
of the same processes as one another, but are nevertheless aptly
thought of as two different systems of injustice. If we point to where
they are each being produced and reproduced, we point to the same
physical things (social actors, social spaces, social activities, and
so on). In this sense, patriarchy and white supremacy are inseparable,
just as a statue and the lump of clay from which it is made are
inseparable. Nevertheless, the ideologies of sexism and racism do
different explanatory work (in the sense discussed in the previous
paragraph), and have different modal properties (in the sense that it
is possible that there could be a society where sexism but not racism
has been eradicated, or vice versa). This is similar to the statue and
the clay: the statue could be destroyed without destroying the lump of
clay (by re-shaping the clay so it is no longer the same statue). In
both cases, Dembroff argues, the differences justify our taking the
two things&mdash;sexism and racism, or the statue and the
clay&mdash;to be distinct, even though they are physically
inseparable. For Dembroff, then, one set of causal processes is
reproducing (at least) two distinct ideologies, gender ideology and
racial ideology, and since a system of injustice is a causal process
of reproducing an ideology, we have on our hands (at least) two
distinct social systems (2024, 392&ndash;394). Haslanger (2024)
replies to Dembroff, emphasising that the difference between their
positions hinges on their differing understandings of what social
systems are (outlined in 3.1) and of what ideology is (see Haslanger
2024, 418&ndash;419; Dembroff 2024, 387) and reiterating her
commitment to the view outlined above.</p>

<h3 id="Preg">1.4 Pregnancy</h3>

<p>
There has been lots of work both in feminist philosophy and beyond on
the <em>ethical</em> relationship between a pregnant person and the
fetus/embryo that they are carrying, especially with regards to
whether the pregnant person has the right to abort that fetus/embryo,
and whether being pregnant imposes any moral restrictions on the
behaviour of the that person (see the entries on
 <a href="../ethics-pregnancy/">Pregnancy, Birth, and Medicine</a>
 and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-family/#3">Feminist Perspectives on Reproduction and the Family)</a>.
 There has also been work exploring the <em>phenomenological</em>
relationship between pregnant persons and the fetuses that they carry
(see e.g.,Young
 1984).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 However, in the past ten years feminists have started to investigate
the metaphysics of
 pregnancy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Here the key question at issue is this: What is the
<em>metaphysical</em> relationship between a pregnant person and the
fetus that they are carrying?</p>

<p>
Simone de Beauvoir describes one metaphysical relationship that might
hold between a pregnant woman and the fetus is one in which the mother
is a passive container of the fetus/embryo: &ldquo;snared by nature,
she is plant and animal, a <em>store-house</em> of colloids, an
<em>incubator</em>, an <em>egg</em>&rdquo; (Beauvoir 1949/2011, 552
emphasis
 added).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 This metaphysics of pregnancy, whereby one organism, the pregnant
animal, surrounds and contains a separate organism, the fetus/embryo,
would go on to be labelled the &lsquo;container model&rsquo; of
pregnancy by Elselijn Kingma. On the container model, the relationship
between a pregnant organism and the embryo/fetus they are carrying can
be thought of as much like the way &ldquo;a tub of yogurt is inside
your refrigerator&rdquo; (Smith and Brogaard 2003, 74).</p>

<p>
The container model of pregnancy is widely assumed: de Beauvoir was
describing a dominant cultural understanding of pregnancy in French
society that that is shared across many other contexts, and the
position has been defended by a number of contemporary philosophers
(e.g., Smith and Brogaard 2003). However, as Kingma has pointed out,
it is hardly the only way that we could think about the metaphysical
relationship between the pregnant organism and the fetus/embryo, or as
she calls them (attempting to find slightly less metaphysically
committal terms) the &lsquo;gravida&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;foster&rsquo; respectively (Kingma 2019).</p>

<p>
Kingma argues that rather than the gravida <em>containing</em> the
foster, the foster is instead a <em>part</em> of the gravida. That is,
on this &lsquo;parthood model&rsquo; of pregnancy, the relationship
between a pregnant organism and the fetus/embryo that they are
carrying is like that between a table and a table leg, or between a
dog and its liver. Her positive argument for this view takes a couple
of forms, but the broad strategy that she pursues is to argue that
whatever concept of biological individuality one adopts (i.e., what
makes this organism one organism and not two) one is forced to suggest
that the foster is not a distinct organism from the gravida, and
instead is a part of the gravida. Take, for instance, immunological
tolerance. One potential way to individuate organisms is by appealing
to what is (barring malfunctions) tolerated by an organism&rsquo;s
immune system: so an organism&rsquo;s kidneys are a part of that
organism, but the bacteria causing an infection in that organism are
not. Kingma argues that since (at least in most cases) fosters are
immunologically tolerated by gravida, this concept of biological
individuality would give us the result that fosters are parts of
gravida (Kingma 2019, 628&ndash;630). Or take topological continuity:
here what makes an organism an individual is a physical and continuous
boundary. Kingma points out that there is no way of drawing a physical
boundary around the foster that does not include the gravida. She
remarks, for instance, that &ldquo;Just as there is a topological
connection between a tail and a cat until the tail is physically
severed, there is a topological connection between the [foster] and
the [gravida] at the level of the umbilicus/umbilical cord, until the
umbilical cord is severed after birth&rdquo; (Kingma 2020a 377).</p>

<p>
Of course, whether or not this argumentative strategy is persuasive in
part depends on whether one thinks that the concepts of biological
individuality surveyed by Kingma are attractive. Indeed, in later work
Kingma looks at some other concepts of biological individuality which
seem to favour the claim that fosters are not parts of gravida (see
Kingma 2020b). If one thinks that such other other concepts are worth
taking seriously, this will put pressure on Kingma&rsquo;s central
claim.</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether Kingma is correct that you were a part of your
(gestating) parent, she has inspired a variety of new philosophical
work on the metaphysics of pregnancy. Maja Sidzinska and Anne Sophie
Meincke have suggested using the tools of process ontology to account
for pregnancy (Sidzinska 2017, Meincke 2022). Alexander Geddes has
recently argued that the proper mereological relationship between
foster and gravida is proper overlap, not parthood (Geddes 2023), and
other mereological possibilities are explored by Suki Finn (Finn 2021
and 2023). Drawing on Aristotle, Hilary Yancey has argued that Kingma
is right that there is a parthood relation between foster and gravida,
but that she has it the wrong way round: the pregnant organism is
rather a part of the embryo/fetus (Yancey 2020). Meanwhile, Chikako
Takeshita has argued that pregnant organisms are best understood as
holobionts, that is, symbiotic systems featuring a host organism
(Takeshita 2022). Beyond the metaphysics of pregnancy narrowly
conceived, Kingma and Finn have drawn on their work on the metaphysics
of pregnancy to develop new distinctions around developing
biotechnologies of ectogenesis (Kingma and Finn 2019), Will Morgan has
presented the mammalian fetus as a problem for the philosophy of
biology (Morgan forthcoming) and Sidzinska has applied the insights of
this field to the history of philosophy, developing a novel challenge
for Descartes by arguing that his system cannot make good sense of
pregnancy without giving up on a major Cartesian philosophical
commitment (Sidzinska Forthcoming).</p>

<p>
The recent attempt to theorise the relationship between fetus and
pregnant person has attempted to fill a lacuna that was long lamented
by a number of feminists. In 1998, Christine Battersby, wrote that we
lack &ldquo;models that explain how identity might be retained whilst
impregnated with otherness, and whilst other selves are generated from
within the embodied self&rdquo; (Battersby 1998, 18). Such a failure,
suggests Battersby, leads to a failure to adequately theorise
dependency and an over-emphasis on individualism. The political stakes
of the metaphysics of pregnancy were also commonly referenced by
feminists lamenting this failure to philosophically theorise
pregnancy. Drawing on Julia Kristeva, Kelly Oliver argued that
reducing women to mere fetal containers devalues women and serves to
undermine their reproductive freedom (Oliver 2010, 774). Meanwhile, it
is clear that de Beauvoir associated a container model of pregnancy
with women&rsquo;s passivity and hence their status as the second sex
(Tyler 2000, 295&ndash;6). These wider political stakes have, however,
somewhat fallen by the wayside in the recent feminist metaphysics of
pregnancy (exceptions here include Lewis 2019 and Takeshita
 2022).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 Open questions thus still remain about the relationship between the
novel metaphysics of pregnancy and traditional ethical debates about
the politics and ethics of pregnancy. One might, for instance, think
that the parthood view of pregnancy, when combined with a commitment
to bodily autonomy, reinforces moral arguments in favour of
reproductive rights (c.f., Purdy 1990). Whether this and related
arguments can be successfully made, however, is yet to be
determined.</p>

<h2 id="FemiMethApprThem">2. Feminist Metaphysical Frameworks</h2>

<h3 id="Rela">2.1 Relations</h3>

<p>
The first part of this entry outlined ways in which feminists have
problematized the idea that particular categories are
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;. Similarly, feminists have problematized the
idea that particular categories are intrinsic or non-relational. The
critical charge, stated very generally, is that dominant frameworks
for representing the world, especially the social world, purport to
classify things on the basis of intrinsic properties when in fact the
classifications are crucially dependent on relational
 properties.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
There are two forms of this critique, and correspondingly, two kinds
of response. On the first form, the charge is that dominant frameworks
misrepresent their subject matter by ignoring important relational
aspects of what they purport to be talking about. For example,
feminists have long charged that philosophical conceptions of the
self, e.g., the conception of the independent rational self-regulator,
are framed in atomistic terms, ignoring our inevitable and valuable
dependence on each other. In response, feminists have urged us to
recognize and revalue the complexity of subjectivity not addressed in
models of rational agency. Our understanding of the self, claim such
feminist metaphysicians, needs to incorporate realities of human
dependence and interdependence, relationships for which women have
been primarily responsible (Meyers 1997; Kittay 1999; Stoljar 2015;
Willett et al.
 2016).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The second form of such critique also alleges that the dominant
frameworks misrepresent their subject matter by obscuring what&rsquo;s
relational. However, the goal is not to capture and revalue the
background relations as in the first form of this critique, but to
challenge them. In the cases in question, the charge is that although
the system of classification appears to be sorting individuals on the
basis of intrinsic properties, in fact there are invidious relations
that are being masked by these appearances (Flax 1986: 199&ndash;202).
Just as there are reasons why dominant frameworks construct myths
about what&rsquo;s natural to justify subordinating practices,
likewise they construct myths about what&rsquo;s intrinsic.</p>

<p>
Take, for an example of this, Haslanger&rsquo;s view of race as a
social hierarchy. Lay views of race suggest that race is intrinsic:
that is, there is some feature or features of individuals in
themselves that makes them a member of this or that race (say, the
colour of their skin). However, for Haslanger, being White is
constitutively constructed by one&rsquo;s subordinating relationship
to Black people. That is, race is
 <em>relational</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 For Haslanger, anti-racist critique here is going to involve both
undermining the lay view of race, so as to reveal the actual social
structures that govern race in society, and undermining that unjust
social structure itself.</p>

<p>
We might also read this kind of move as happening in Beauvoir&rsquo;s
claim that &ldquo;He is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is the
Other&rdquo;1949/2011, 6). Part of what is at stake in
Beauvoir&rsquo;s conception of women as Other is the idea that our
conceptions of gender and of the self are implicitly relational, e.g.,
although it may seem that we can define what it is to be a woman
without reference to men, in fact we cannot (Wittig 1992; MacKinnon
1989; Haslanger 1993). For Beauvoir, very roughly, women are those
positioned as &lsquo;Absolute Other&rsquo;, i.e., as Other in relation
to a group counting as Subject where the relation between these two
groups never reverses so the Other becomes Subject (Beauvoir
1949/2011, Introduction). So, to be a woman is to stand in a complex
set of social (and hierarchical) relations to men (<em>mutatis
mutandis</em> for men). Meanwhile, to be a Subject is to stand in a
complex set of social relations to some group of Others (see Bauer
2011).</p>

<p>
These particular claims of Beauvoir&rsquo;s are, of course,
controversial and would need further argument to be made plausible;
but the claims themselves are less important than the general idea
that relations, especially social relations, are sometimes obscured by
our ordinary frameworks for thinking of things. This is of special
interest to feminists (and antiracists) for reasons linked to those we
have for questioning the representation of a category as
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;. Begin with a background assumption that social
life cannot help but accommodate what&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo;.
We then can contribute to some category&rsquo;s appearing
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; by supposing that the basis for membership in
the category is intrinsic (thus obscuring the social relations that
are the real basis for membership). In this context, pressure to
change or abolish the category is (wrongly) made to seem unreasonable.
The critiques raised in this section instead invite us to ask: how
should we re-conceptualize the self and other parts of our social
ontology? What is the relation between intrinsicness and naturalness?
On what basis can we claim that one framework is &ldquo;masking&rdquo;
another?</p>

<h3 id="Dual">2.2 Dualisms</h3>

<p>
In the previous section we outlined a project of
&ldquo;uncovering&rdquo; relations in apparently non-relational
frameworks. In the sort of cases we had in mind, what&rsquo;s
&ldquo;uncovered&rdquo; are concrete social relations: e.g., relations
of sexual subordination. However, Beauvoir&rsquo;s claims about
Subject and Other point to additional insights not yet explored.</p>

<p>
In saying that &ldquo;He is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is
the Other&rdquo; (Beauvoir1949/2011, 6), part of Beauvoir&rsquo;s
point is that although it may appear that our distinction between
subjects and non-subjects is a purely descriptive demarcation of a
specific category of substances (selves), in fact, the distinction in
use is normative and non-substantive. Begin with the issue of
substances: one of the traditional characteristics of substances is
that substances do not have opposites, i.e., there is no opposite of
horse (non-horse does not count as an opposite c.f., Anonymous 2023).
This is in contrast to many qualities: long/short, inside/outside,
loud/quiet. One way of explicating Beauvoir&rsquo;s suggestion is that
once we look at the conditions for subjecthood, we see that there is
an opposite to being a subject: subjects are, for example, free and
autonomous persons, and the opposite of a free and autonomous person
is someone unfree&mdash;in her terms, someone condemned to immanence.
Moreover, it is not only the case that being a subject has an
opposite, but that the opposition in question carries normative
weight&mdash;so much so that the devalued side of the opposition (the
Other) is denied reality in its own terms: what it is to be Other just
is to be opposite to the Subject.</p>

<p>
Again, the feminist project is one of unmasking certain ordinary
assumptions about our classifications of things: the category of
Subject is not&mdash;ontologically speaking&mdash;what it may seem.
More specifically, categories that appear to be descriptive may in
fact be functioning normatively; and categories that appear to be
substantive, may in fact be functioning as one end of a qualitative
spectrum. Although Beauvoir&rsquo;s example has us focus on the notion
of a subject or self; feminists have explored the same form of
argument with other notions, notably, sex, gender, and race.</p>

<p>
There are two significant consequences of this sort of analysis.
First, with substances, it is standardly supposed that you are a
member of the kind or not and there is no middle ground: you are a
horse or you aren&rsquo;t. Again, we can contrast this with opposites:
there is a middle ground between long/short, inside/outside,
loud/quiet; and some things avoid the opposition altogether, e.g., my
coffee mug is neither loud nor quiet. Casting a category as
substantial, then, limits the available categories for classification.
For example, suppose we understand &lsquo;male&rsquo; substantively.
If males are a substance kind, then everything is either male or
not-male, with no middle-ground. But if, in practice,
&lsquo;not-male&rsquo; actually functions as a way of picking out
females, then it would seem that everything must be either male or
female, and there can be no space for genuine categories of people who
are intersex, or other-sexed, or for refusing to sex people at all.
One strategy, then, for undermining the idea that a category is
substantival is to highlight the multiplicity of individuals and
categories &ldquo;in between&rdquo; the primary category and its
implicit opposite. Category proliferation&mdash;the generation of a
continuum or genuinely &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; categories&mdash;can loosen
the grip of substantival assumptions (Butler 1987; Lugones 1994;
Haraway 1988; Zack 1995).</p>

<p>
Second, in the case of substance kinds, those things that are not in
the kind don&rsquo;t themselves form a kind of their own. They are
what&rsquo;s &ldquo;left over&rdquo;. The class of all things that are
not-horses includes computers, stars, dust, basketballs, people, etc.
So, if we elide &lsquo;not man&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, then
women are not read as a kind. As Marilyn Frye puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When woman is defined as not-man, she is cast into the infinite
undifferentiated plenum&hellip;[this partly explains why] many men can
so naturally speak in parallel constructions of their cars and their
women, and say things like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my house, my wife, and
my money, and the government can&rsquo;t tell me what to do about any
of it&rdquo;. It also illuminates the fact that women are so easily
associated with disorder, chaos, irrationality, and
impurity&hellip;.There are no categories in not-man; it is a buzzing
booming confusion. (Frye 1996: 1000)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Frye&rsquo;s strategy is not to challenge the substantive status of
the man-kind by proliferation, but to challenge its hegemony in the
space of persons. So, she proposes the construction of a woman-kind
that is defined in its own terms, not simply by opposition to men (see
Schor &amp; Weed 1994). She argues, among other things, that this will
require a recognition of real differences not only between men and
women, but also among
 women.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Whilst work on dualisms (and to a lesser extent, relations) has
somewhat fallen out of fashion in recent feminist metaphysics, there
is a rich and extensive tradition of work here to be explored. We have
barely scratched the surface of feminist discussion of the dualisms
that guide our thinking, both in philosophy and common sense. These
include mind/body, reason/emotion (Lloyd 1984; Jaggar 1989; Scheman
1993; Rooney 1993, 1994; Campbell 1998), nature/culture (Ortner 1972;
Butler 1993), freedom/necessity (Mackenzie &amp; Stoljar 2000;
Hirschmann 2003; Holroyd 2011), agent/patient (Meyers 2004a,b).</p>

<p>
Many feminist metaphysicians, especially in the ecofeminist tradition,
have also been keen to point out that many of these dualisms are often
culturally linked. Val Plumwood, for instance, writes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the ecofeminist perspective, western thought has been characterised
by a set of interrelated and mutually reinforcing dualisms that
involve key concepts for understanding the social structure. Some of
these can be set out as follows (the list is by no means
complete).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
(Plumwood 1986, 131).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Plumwood suggests that this linkage is combined with the widespread
cultural assumption that those spheres on the left are superior, those
on the right inferior: dualisms are a form of differentiation
&ldquo;in which power constructs and construes difference in terms of
an inferior and alien realm&rdquo; (Plumwood 1993a
 443).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 She contends that the interwoven nature of these dualisms implies
that any successful feminist movement against gender hierarchy must
also be ecofeminist, opposing the other dualisms in this list, not
least the human/animal and cultural/natural dualisms. For more
discussion see Plumwood 1993b; Lloyd 1984.</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, this is but an introduction to the extensive
feminist work on dualisms and relations. However, it does, hopefully,
provide some introduction to the feminist issues that arise in
thinking about classification, substances, dichotomy, and the
potential political import of ontology and the prime importance of the
question of value ladenness and attention to ideology in feminist
theorizing (Alcoff 2011; Haslanger 2011; Janack 2011).</p>

<h3 id="Meta">2.3 Metametaphysics</h3>

<p>
To some, &lsquo;feminist metaphysics&rsquo; might appear to be an
oxymoron. Metaphysics, one might think, is the apolitical,
quasi-scientific study of the fundamental nature of reality: what is
and what is not, carving reality at its joints. Whereas feminism, one
might think, is a political movement aimed at liberation and a
normative theoretical perspective on social reality. These are not
obviously enterprises that can be done at the same time. Sure, one
might be a feminist who campaigns for gender liberation, and a
metaphysician who studies the nature of holes (see the entry on
 <a href="../holes/">Holes</a>)
 but on the above characterisations, doing a feminist version of
metaphysics means working at cross purposes with oneself, at once
trying to be apolitical and political, at once thinking about
fundamental reality but also social reality. Indeed, some feminist
theorists have argued against engaging in metaphysics precisely due to
its putative apolitical status, and irrelevance to gender liberation.
This critique of feminist metaphysicians by other feminists has
rarely, if ever, been made in print (though it is discussed by Mikkola
2015, 781fn1, and McKitrick 2018), but it has been a longstanding
point of discussion at feminist conferences in the 20th and 21st
centuries.</p>

<p>
Despite such critique, if the rich traditions of feminist metaphysics
surveyed in this entry are anything to go by, many feminists have
largely turned away from such worries, and are happily engaged in
doing feminist metaphysics. However, the putative tension between
feminism and metaphysics is not dissolved so easily. In the 2010s, a
critique that started not from feminism but from mainstream
metaphysics became a hot topic for discussion, centred around the
following question: is feminist metaphysics really metaphysics?</p>

<p>
If we are to get a handle on whether this question should trouble
feminist metaphysicians, we should probably have a more thoroughly
worked out idea of what metaphysics is. This is (part of) the domain
of <em>metametaphysics</em>: attempting to give an account of the
nature of metaphysics. Troublingly, however, the debate in
metametaphysics has at certain points looked as if it would rule out
feminist metaphysics entirely. Elizabeth Barnes and Mari Mikkola have
argued that several prominent conceptions of metaphysics cannot easily
make sense of the activities that go under the label &lsquo;feminist
metaphysics&rsquo;. Mikkola writes, &ldquo;This is bad news for
self-proclaimed feminist metaphysicians... suggesting that we are
simply confused and mistaken about what we are doing&rdquo; (Mikkola
2017, 2437). According to this kind of worry, there are, broadly
speaking, two aspects of feminist metaphysics that prominent accounts
of metaphysics rule out from counting as metaphysics proper: their
methodology and their subject matter.</p>

<p>
The main methodological clash between feminist and so-called
&lsquo;traditional&rsquo; metaphysics is over the place of moral and
political values in metaphysical theorising. In contrast to (at least
the self-conception of) the neutrality of many traditional
 metaphysicians,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 feminist metaphysicians tend to build political commitments into
their methodology. Most obviously, feminist metaphysics builds such
commitments in at the level of question choice: which aspects of
reality are to be studied is a political question, and the focus on
topics such as gender, pregnancy, and intersectionality are in part of
interest to feminists due to their political significance. However,
feminist moral and political values can also enter into the
methodology of feminist metaphysics when determining what counts as
evidence for a metaphysical claim (feminist metaphysicians are often
sceptical of mainstream metaphysics&rsquo; uncritical reliance on
intuition given the distorting influence of ideology), and whether a
metaphysical claim is justified, significant or should be endorsed
(recall the discussion of ameliorative inquiry above). Mari Mikkola
points out that this incursion of moral and political values into
metaphysical inquiry runs against the grain of mainstream views in
metametaphysics: &ldquo;one might accept that feminist insights make a
difference to political and moral philosophy (or to value theory),
such insights appear simply irrelevant for this characterisation of
metaphysics... metaphysics seems to be a paradigm value-neutral
endeavor, which is <em>prima facie</em> incompatible with
feminism&rsquo;s explicitly normative stance and its emphasis on how
gender makes a difference to philosophical inquiry&rdquo; (Mikkola
2015, 781). Of course, strictly speaking, some values do enter into
even the most apolitical forms of inquiry: &lsquo;cognitive&rsquo;
values like accuracy, consistency, fruitfulness, and simplicity guide
scientific and mainstream metaphysical theory choice. However,
mainstream accounts of metaphysics have for a long time suggested that
there is a strong divide between moral-political values and these
cognitive values, and that only the latter should guide metaphysical
inquiry (c.f., Longino 1990).</p>

<p>
The second conflict between feminist metaphysics and mainstream
accounts in metametaphysics concerns their subject matter.
Metaphysics, traditionally construed, concerns something like
&lsquo;ultimate reality&rsquo;&mdash;the deepest and most fundamental
structure of reality. Meanwhile, feminist metaphysics is largely
concerned with gender and other parts of social reality, and whatever
social reality is, it isn&rsquo;t fundamental: it is constructed from
more fundamental parts of reality (though see Bernstein 2021).
Let&rsquo;s look at a metametaphysical account to make this idea
clearer: Jonathan Schaffer&rsquo;s account of metaphysics as the study
of
 grounding.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 For Schaffer, metaphysics proper is the study of &lsquo;what grounds
what&rsquo;: &ldquo;as Aristotle said from the start [metaphysics] is
about the primary substances which provide the ground of being&rdquo;
(Schaffer 2009, 157). Grounding is a non-causal dependence relation
that is asymmetric, irreflexive, and transitive, such that less
fundamental features of the world are grounded by more fundamental
features of the world. So, that <em>a wall stands upright in virtue of
the sturdiness of the bricks that make it up</em> is a grounding
relationship, as is <em>these bricks are sturdy because of their
constituent chemical structure</em> (see the entry on
 <a href="../grounding/">Metaphysical Grounding</a>).
 Metaphysics, then, studies these relationships, with a particular
focus on the most fundamental grounds of reality. According to
Elizabeth Barnes, this leaves questions in feminist metaphysics
outside of the scope of proper metaphysical inquiry:
&ldquo;<em>Which</em> genders are there? And how many? Are there
distinct genders corresponding to every gender identification or
gender term? Do genderqueer, non-binary, genderfluid, androgyne,
bigender, and genderfuck all exist distinct social categories?&rdquo;
(Barnes 2014, 343). Telling us about the fundamental grounds of being
seems to leave such questions unanswered. Meanwhile, as Mikkola points
out, the looping nature of some social kinds means that a grounding
framework is ill-suited to thinking about many questions in feminist
metaphysics (Mikkola 2015, 788&ndash;789). To take an example of the
&lsquo;loopiness&rsquo; of social kinds, does the social structure of
racism ground the racist attitudes and actions of individuals, or do
the attitudes and actions of individuals ground the social structure?
The two relata here seem so causally and historically imbricated that
it is unclear that one grounds or is &lsquo;more fundamental&rsquo;
than the other.</p>

<p>
Can traditional accounts of metaphysics be adapted to better make
sense of what feminist metaphysicians are up to? Well, it certainly
looks as if there&rsquo;s nothing stopping one from adopting
Schaffer&rsquo;s or another traditional view of what metaphysics is,
and nevertheless incorporate moral-political as well as by cognitive
values into one&rsquo;s inquiry (Schaffer 2017, 2462&ndash;2463).
Certainly, mainstream philosophy of science has shifted in recent
years to widely appreciate and accept the insight from feminist
philosophy of science that moral and political values can play
important roles in scientific inquiry, and we might think that it is
only natural that any metaphysics that sees itself as continuous with
the sciences, or even just using something like a quasi-scientific
method should similarly begin to take moral and political values
seriously (see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">Feminist Philosophy of Science</a>).
 Moreover, the grounding framework need not &lsquo;privilege the
fundamental&rsquo; in ways that marginalise the social world. We
could, for instance, be interested in studying what grounds the
existence of genders. Indeed, in his response to Mikkola and Barnes,
Schaffer makes the case that &lsquo;what grounds what&rsquo; in the
social realm is of particular interest (Schaffer
 2017).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Schaffer&rsquo;s case here has been strengthened by a number of
social ontologists engaging with traditional issues in feminist
metaphysics using (versions of) the grounding framework, notably
Epstein 2015&rsquo;s introduction of the grounding/anchoring
distinction (see the entry on
 <a href="../social-ontology/">Social Ontology)</a>.
 However, it is still unclear whether this is satisfactory: take for
instance the question of how many genders there are. It might turn out
that the answer to this question floats free from an account of how
gender is grounded. Moreover, it is unclear whether the grounding
theorist can make sense of looping kinds without a serious rethinking
of the nature of grounds, perhaps allowing that two things can ground
one
 another.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Whether or not Schaffer and other mainstream metametaphysicians can
successfully modify their accounts to capture what is going on in
feminist metaphysics, it is worth noting that the metaphilosophical
tides have changed a great deal in the short period since Mikkola
wrote that it was bad news for feminist metaphysicians if their work
was ruled out by mainstream accounts of metaphysics. Rather, the
increased centrality of feminist philosophy to the field of
philosophy, and the excellent work taking place in feminist
metaphysics, mean that as Schaffer and others seem to recognise, if
metametaphysicians cannot make sense of what feminist metaphysicians
are doing, then so much the worse for their accounts of the nature of
metaphysics (e.g., Schaffer 2017, Sider 2017). As feminists we might
think that this is a rather welcome shift in disciplinary politics.
Rather than thinking that our work needs to fit the definitions given
to us by male metametaphysicians, we instead produce a field that does
work for feminism on our own terms. On this view, there is no tension
between feminism and metaphysics worth worrying about. Feminist
metaphysics has shown that metaphysics should be engaged with the
nonfundamental, should study looping kinds, and may include moral and
political values. How best to talk about this varied practice in
general terms is rather a task for
 metametaphysicians.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup></p>
